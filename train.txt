not much to write about here but it does exactly what its supposed to
filters out the pop sounds
now my recordings are much more crisp
the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable
the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it
nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops
this pop filter is great
it looks and performs like a studio filter
so good that i bought another one
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
i just learned last night how to coil them up
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
but no harm done still works great
i have used monster cables for years and with good reason
the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone
i went back to my planet waves cable
what im getting at is you get what you pay for
i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day
but i havent bought a guitar cable since this one
20 plus years and still working
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii
monster cables are well constructed
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either
you cant go wrong with monster cables
monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end
i am so glad i did
what the more expensive model has going for it is looks
i got it to have it if i needed it
if i was really good i can see the need
but this is a keyboard not an organ
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard
it does just what i wanted it to do
i bought this to use with my keyboard
i wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals
doesnt have the same feel either
this fender cable is the perfect length for me
sometimes i find it a bit too long but i dont mind
the build quality is great and i know that it will last
wanted it just on looks alone
it is a nice looking cord
i know it will perform
his shipping team do great work
never any complaints from me
not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better
these are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables
five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs 12 shipped
do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab
you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose
fender cords look great and work just as well
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well
i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault
youll be able to hear them rattle
i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables
its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident
the green cable is good for that
well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele
firm fit solidly molded ends reputable branded cable
couldnt go wrong for 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility
for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality
connection is secure no worries about uneven connections it also detaches without a hitch
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made
i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere
i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly
you really will not be disappointed with these
i bought these to go from my board to the amp
we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating
they are still going strong
sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value
i dont require professionallevel equipment so this cord serves my purposes well
use it every week at gigs
solid no problems with the solder joints
a good quality cable at a very good price
hosa products are a good bang for the buck
this was exactly what i was after
before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches
who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place
hard to find just 10 mike cords
usually longer ones are only obtainable
this cable seems like it will last me for a while
an excellent value for the money
nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends
zero issues with this cable so far
ill update this review ifwhen it breaks
realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar
im pleasantly surprised with this cable
its decent sound and decent build quality for a good price
this is a very nice cable for the price
i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine
inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic
havent noticed any hum or crackles
for sure a good buy
cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff
only time will tell how well the soldering is
im not a professional but have been playing for many many years
the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable
i didnt expect this cable to be so thin
its easily 12 the thickness of any guitar cable ive used
not sure about longterm durability or signal lossinterference
still it works and was inexpensive
edit  6 months later and its dead already
wire frayed at the right angle jack
you get what you pay for
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar
it seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks
it hums crackles and i think im having problems with my equipment
hosa makes some other products that have good value
but based on my experience i dont recommend this one
i am not hard on cables
this one seem to perform just fine
no buzz andor other noises noted
i have several of them and they have all performed well
i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value
grade a cable at a very affordable price
definitely  going back for more
cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft
the cord is reliable and clean sounding
i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence
hopefully this review will be usefull to you
this my second hosa guitar cable
the other one is shorter
like my first hosa cable this is a high quality item
id definitely buy more cables of this brand
its a guitar instrument cable what can i say
maybe not the best but it serves its purpose
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around
from experience they tend to just die without notice
i have a feeling this one will last a long time
it is built sturdy and sounds really good
hosa guitar cables work great
never had any problems with them
i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price
i have absolutely no complaints
this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed
very low noise repairable effective strain releafthick rubber cover
this is a great buy under 10 bucks for a quality cord
of course i just got it
it might not be durable but it looks durable
if i change my mind about anything i will update my review
for now i would say buy one
this is a good solid cable with no problems
this guitar cable is very nice
it looks high quality and has the white ends
fantastic deal for this cable
good product at a good price
have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker
great to have when friends come over to jam
hosa cable gtr210 guitar instrument cable  10ft
is a high quality instrument cable but low cost wont break the bank
im very satisfied with my purchase
unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights
this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great
nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough
these cables arrived in good working condition and weve been using them continuously since
i would buy more if i needed them
when this showed up in a cable search on amazon i jumped on it
i figured i had nothing to lose
i will never do that again
set your guitar down on it by accident when its plugged in and
but for seven bucks it gets the job done
recommended if you are doing the beginner thing and testing the waters
otherwise spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting
hosa makes good stuff this is no exception
only complaint is the size which is my fault
hard to day too much but it works great
no issues to speak of
for the price this works really well
it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now
this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for
its quality outweighs its price
lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable
but the quality of these cables can vary greatly
ive seen more expensive cables and this one is so far great
it feels reliable and without adding noise
these are good cables at a good price
ive seen and used some better cables but not at this price point
and ive certainly seen quite a few worse
this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion
im a procheapo and i hated this thing
theyre noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummylike
drop few more bucks and get something else
works great on my 100 watt amp
almost compares to a monster cable
and with its length its plenty of room from your guitar to amp
good cable as good as any expensive brand
thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded
i own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there
ive only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so
it is a decent cable
the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth
the switch is also loose
i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications
it would be more suited to home or hobby use
works the way its supposed to
90 degree trs is a nice touch
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected
what can you say about an adapter cord
it works fine for the handy type recorders
but forget hooking this directly to a pc
the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long
the actual wire is under 834 long itself
still a tight fit though since theres only 834 of wire
well made xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini
this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable
pin 3 then ties to pin 1 with the ground wire
another reason why i love this is its noise free
i have not had that problem with this one so its another plus
i own several of these and love them
i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional
also check out hosas sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter
first its construction is pretty light weight
that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it
second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it
it pays to shop around
minor clean up in post
great stereo sound out of the keyboards
i highly recommend this cable
another quality product from hosa
just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq
no noise from this cable
highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable
especially considering the price these are brilliant
but my effects boxes like to have separate 14 tr ins and outs
i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great
and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce
when you need an audio insert cable you need an audio insert cable
we custom manufacture insert cables for custom soundreinforcement fixed installations
there are other brands but our reputation is at stake
hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation while lowering our labor costs
thanks for such a dependable product hosa
thanks for such a great price amazon
i play my ipod through a small guitar amp
great way to wake up the kids
works perfectly for the purpose
if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else
this is what it is
a super cheap mono cable
just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc
for the price and intent i almost gave it 5 stars
but its not a 5star cable
its a fair quality ultra cheap cable
4 stars seems about right
not sure what other than complete failure would take stars away
and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality
doesnt suck tone cables are sturdy and they sound great
the product description says 6 inches right
if you jump over to these http www
ieutf8psc1 planet waves patch cables theyre listed at
5 feet same as 6 inches right
i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up
to conclude would i recommend these
but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else
if you need some 6 cables to connect your pedals look no farther
they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap
what more could you ask for
bought this hosa pedal cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal
it works well and seems to be durable
it hasnt given him any problems so far
it doesnt appear to change the sound quality or tone
well constructed durable built to last
i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes
the only con i could give is if they go bad
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp
do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers
their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order
right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones
these are great patch cables especially for the price
this is a very good cable
i dont forsee having any problems with it
its just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables
if you need this get it
the price is right and shipping was right on time
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great
quality product for a good price
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together
often cheap cords die within a year or so
i probably have around twelve of them
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck
im a firm hosa cable fan
just not what i needed in my particular situation
now i can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2
its an 8 channel xlr snake
why do i go through all that you ask
i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic
arrived as expected very solid great fit
this has come in handy many times in my studio z108net
we love having it around
as the title says it works
but no issues besides that
could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs
perhaps i got the wrong thing
its affordable and it works
for the price cant beat it
just a basic female xlr to 14 inch male adapter
as expected from hosa another great product
solid construction and great sound reproduced
i would recomed this product to everyone
the quality is fine and it does what its supposed to do
good price for a good product
this is a solid product
i ended up not needing it so
however it worked fine and gets the job done
this dual splitter works perfect
i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings
the most important part of video is the audio
i always say half of video is audio
this product has improved my productions beyond its price sold
they work perfectly and havent failed me once
this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genzbenz bass amplification company
andy said that this product is far superior to any other
fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 60 amp
after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved
this thing is like a magic spray
i used this on noisy hinges car doors etc
i bought this product to use on my amp pots
it restored the soundpower and clearity of my amps
it was made for the military
the spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high
it does work but the stuff i used to have was much better
it is just very wasteful for the cost
i have had good luck with wd40 too but it is very flammable
i would call it average
95 of the time this will take care of the problem
the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over
its really like magic in a can
i sprayed it in my bass guitars pot and now its like new
wish i had found this stuff sooner
a dab will do ya
something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning
ive got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years
use this alot on all kinds of electronics
it gets crackling knobs going again
ive use it for years
great for what i needed
for the money this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use
good to keep as a spare in the gig box
its all about money to them
im a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me
after all whos playingand getting paid for it
i bought this cable for my bands live show setup
i dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine
if theyre used for live performances they will not last very long
i need to resolder the ends after a concert though
theres nothing complicated about this purchase
it doesnt cost a lot
i use it every week and it still sounds perfect
then again i never mistreat my equipment
theyre cheap and they work fine
i havent noticed any sound issues at all
ive had this cable for awhile and im not too impressed with the quality
the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin
i dont think it would hold up long on stage at a venue
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls
they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well
guessing they are lacking some shielding
i have a few shure sm58s which cost more
it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website
its perfect for vocals podcasting video recording and so forth
whats also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included
im very happy with this purchase
the sound quality is excellent
the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out
i havent heard a hint of feedback and the onoff switch is a plus
the same is true of a lot of audio gear
i cannot recommend it strongly enough
so far im very happy with this microphone
this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured
i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s
it also has a different switch than the sm58
the metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable
i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical
i repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikes
heres what i noticed  the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range
the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence
they are about equal on volume
neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop
i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side
i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike
i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity
these mikes sound almost identical the b 2000 and the shure sm
the model number is 333001 probably also discontinued
this was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and tone
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar
built to last and it is a shure
right now though id say great product
i bought this one to replace a shure 8900
its a big step up from that one
i am pleased with it
the old one had a lot of handling noise
my next one will be an sm58 but that will be awhile from now
im very happy with this pg58
update december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider
it would keep me from buying another one of these
other mics i own dont have this problem to this degree
i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58
large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive
this is a proven classic
using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
sounds fantastic and is solidly built
the sm57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled
that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm57
the sm57 will pop like mad without one
i cant find a modern sm57 with a switch anywhere
you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen
best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals
best mike for the price and purpose
the shure sm57 sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged
they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas
if its an instrument the sm57 delivers
i hear its good for vocals as well
when the president gives a speech the sm57 is there
in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57
the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabes
sounds great on amps and perc
this is the last of the cool from shure
i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets
it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most
and on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the price
so make sure you try before you buy
a best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals
ive knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged
i couldnt be happier with it
this mic is well made heavy on the micend
however i have yet to try it with my multitrack studio
i bought this for my teen son for christmas
he loves to play his bass and sing along
nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy
shure knocked this one out of the park
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs
an all around tough mic
great for all your needs
i just turn the mic off
if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic
this mic is quite good for its price
i would probably say it exceeds your expectations
arrived as promised in a frustration free packing
how do you review an sm58
ive used these most of my life and will continue to
ive used shure sm58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968
people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm58
this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away
however for other people the sm58 works better
it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do
one certain advantage of the sm58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability
all the proline shure mics are top quality
the pro line shures also hold their value well
i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one
senneheisers evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look
great all around mic used for vocals
no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music
ive just got the shure sm58 microphone
they shipped in less time than expected
im a really happy customer now
and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp
use it all the time
a nice addition to my recording home studio
i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music
this mic works better for some people than others
if it doesnt sound good then i try something else
i have no complaints it is my go to mic
i bought two microphones a akg d5 and sm58
the sm sounded muted compared to d5 without any sound modification out of box
the output is also a little less sensitive than the d5
however i like the look of sm58 and it seems to be extremely durable
i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller
consumers require choice but with the shure sm58 there need be none
its all just so much marketing garbage
these mics are the best mic for the buck out there
this is a well made low noise and low cost cable
im quite happy with it
i use this cable for small home recording projects
the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy
one wouldnt fit in my soundboard another wouldnt lock in my mic
if your looking for crap that doesnt work
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another
my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made
its no peavey but it works just as good
it was cheap and came fast
i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine
they do what theyre supposed to do
this was one of two i purchased
also bought the 25 length and used them on an assignment recently
go to my website and look for it
not much to say other than its a good cable
good solid connections with no play
after consistent use its going strong
no complaints its quiet enough and the price is right
is it a monster cable
no but it doesnt cost as much either
well made and the perfect length for my needs
the shielding was great as well
the end connectors were well made and strong
i purchased this to connect a sennheiser e825 mike with guitar amps
this requires of course the addition of a 14 inch adapter plug
the set screw fell out and could not be found
ive had similar problems with other pyle products
would i purchase this again
the extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability
cord works well and hasnt been any problem to date
plugs directly to the system or my miniamp
i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues
my equipment is very secure
they screw in and hold things
to say that they did less wouldve gotten the 1 star
good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment
arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice
excellent rack screws with washers
its fit very good to rack holes
good presentation and well packed
there are exactly as described and do the job
what more can a guy say about a little box of screws
maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action
pros  they look very nice
they cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers
donr be fooled by the imitations
other than that when you need 1032 rack screws these are the real mccoy
mics are like pants you have to find the right fit
this one i like for my vocals live
i sing fairly low and airy  works great for me
i prefer it to the 58 seems a bit more bright and natural
might purchase another one eventually
why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac
this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned
sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a
spring for the extra bucks and be happy
thats what i always say
i have one of these as well as several other microphones
basically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound
i would buy this again
im an amateur sound tech
when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah
for me it sounded better than sm58
my songleaders have tested it and guess what
anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority
six out of five stars
the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards thats well known
quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their goto house mics
the beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response
this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected
they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter
toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc
chances are its in working order no matter what
i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal
if its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds
i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make
the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link
i dont think its true bypass either
the features and sound are the same
hey it gets the job done and thats all i can ask for
i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all
with not much left i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro
then i got into guitar building and they all got put away
i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them
forget the fab series they are not so hot
you will not be sorry
hello musicfriends  this is built cheap but sounds great
may be  the age thing
nice and warm and lush
one of the better trems ive had the pleasure to use
however i hate the plastic housing and how the inputoutput jacks are located
it is exactly what you need in a capo
all in all a great capo that is well made and will last forever
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours
prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses
my son needed a capo expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons
at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price
the title says it all
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
i like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar
quick to clip on and off
is there anything else to say
what else do you want it to do
these suckers are wonderfully reliable
ive had one for about 10 years
a couple of bucks more than dunlop
which i have not tried
like this camo capos simplicity and its unique color
this capo looks great and does the job
quality seems top notch design is simple and effective
the spring tension is just right
basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion
i have big hands which may be part of it
high quality hassle free design
very happy with this purchase
finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple
it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar
durable affordable easy to grasp and use
i currenty use two types of capos  the kyser one and shubb capos
both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses
the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension
got what i needed  a basic capo for a good price
the tension is a little tighter than id like but works for me
covers all strings and depresses them fully
ive played guitar for 5 years
seen many different capos but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser
you really cant go wrong with this capo
it is very mobile easily adjustable sturdy and durable
the transparent rubber piece does the same job
it comes in different colors also
i own the black silver gold and camo kyser capos
i also own the cut capo for other styles
all the capos ive had from kyser are still in great conditions
its cheap and easy to use
itll do the job but i dont like it
its so much better than the elastic capos
so its doing double duty and going strong
when used correctly though it does its job just fine
its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off
and the price makes it a real bargain
for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use
this is just good common sense
if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another
i bought a 12 string one in blk
got gold to remind me it is for six strings
i have used a few different capos this is far and away my favorite
very easy to take it off holds the strings tight
what more can you ask for
does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive
it does what it says
it a kyser quick change capo
yet it is a capo structured very well
i am very pleased with this purchase
the strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar
his old one lasted about 10 years
long time shubb user but decided to try something different
i think ive found how lazy i am
perfect all the way around
long lasting and backed up by the company
good strong spring and good strong materials
the protector needs to be longer
as the protector ages it slips off the end
i bought this capo for mywashburn d10
it works on my orlando classical guitar as well
durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum
the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video
its the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly
the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent
i dont think you can go wrong with this one
the price is right for these and they work just fine
good strength  holds the strings down well
probably the best kapo out on the market
very high quality and a sleek look
easy to use what more could you want
i use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome
the capo is very easy to use as well
the description says the color is gold
more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for
i think i would stick with the black color though
the spring could definitely be tighter
i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough
also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aesthetic
its not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily
it just isnt a high end product5star perfect
the package arrived on time
this is the best capo around and works great
does what it is supposed to do
just clip it on and jam out
forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one
youll be happier trust me
i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons
the capo itself is really good
it is very snug on the strings
these martin strings m170 arent bad
they just are not the sound i was looking for
i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead
the martins are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball
other people will love them though
they are easy to play
not the fullest tone but you wouldnt expect that with extra light strings
i have an electro acoustic martin second hand but without a scratch
13 strings and well is simply too much
is good to play rithyms but cant do pretty much nothing else
i have installed a set i got 8 and it sounds really good
not as solid as the
martin makes great sounding strings
i decided to use light martin strings
strings are not just strings
guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar
and all martin products are second to none
i replaced a set of strings that were very used with these martins
they are as named very light
they are easy on my fingers and give great tone
quality company great strings great price
this strings have good sound and hold a tune well
the best thing is the price is great
the name martin says it all  has for manymany years
grab some extras because you will want more great pricegreat strings
i love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing
easy to play and they sound great
long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time
good strings with good sound
the extra light is easier on the fingers  but they sound thinner too
so i want to keep a completed pack for back up
these are okay strings for the folk guitar
nothing special but the price isnt out of the world either
good buy for the money
tried them on a gibson j50 and they seem to do good
these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better
after putting in new pegs and restringing with these strings
it sounds so much nicer
i will be set to go
my fingers get sore when playing
i also have small fingers and hands
i intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use
i restrung my martin 016ny with these strings and found them to be excellent
i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate
i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing
the sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get
the shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order
i bought a set awhile back for my ovation but never used them
i put these suckers on there and wow was i impressed
even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings
i bought another set for the ovation this time
this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string
stays in place well and is very convenient
only negative is i dont know how long it will hold up
i really like these things
bought a few while back and just bought a few more
if you drop a pick there is another right there
further it will not add something else to findloose in my pants pocket
fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing
easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end
since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them
i like to use different gage picks therefore
it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock
besides that its highly recommendable to anyone
i will definitely pick up more for my other axes
i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics
he lost it after performing in a play on stage
i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar
i have been using these for months now with 5string bass
and no tape or other sticky stuff
there is also a model made specially for bass
updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses
it is definitely better for thicker strings
the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer
they should make a metal edition for that
very handy to have two picks with you at all times
price cant be beat either
but otherwise worth the price and a good doodad to have around
ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years
all good in their own respect
finally settling on this cherry burst lp100
it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding
it was even sorta in tune
but a quick dialin with the electronic tuner brought that right
exactly the same as describe here love the sound and easy to play
great price for excellent sound highly recommend to everyone
i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on
everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it
you cant beat this for the price
this is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing
still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery
09 strings without additional hardware
i have been playing guitar for over 30 years
ive owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime
my wife bought this guitar for me as a gift
i cannot begin to tell you how much i love this guitar
it is a solid well built guitar
the pictures do it no justice
it has great tone and sustain wonderful harmonics
the clean tones are nice and warm
no fret noise or hums
the pickups are really nice
its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it
from blues to hard rock  metal
i would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat
you cannot find a better guitar for this price
i would have expected it to cost much more
i am extremely impressed with this great guitar
its much easier to play than the squier and it has a better sound
its also a good choice for women
im a small woman and i really like that the neck is smaller
overall im happy with my choice
a guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under 500
i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldnt be happier
all it needed was tuning
it does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant to
it just feels good in your hands
the finish on this product is very nice
would recommend picking up a new one when you order
overall this is well worth the 500 that they list as the msrp
at less than half that its a steal
if you are considering this instrument dont hesitate
well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning
this thing is simply beautiful
it arrived well padded in a double box
not a finger print on it anywhere
this guitar is extremely well made and put together right
it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter
i put a quarter under the 10th
fret and its right on the 34money34
its considerably heaver than than i thought
i would imagine it weighs about 1014lbs
i have a strap ordered and on the way
the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish
all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups
this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had
your hand floats over the frets
i dont think you could get a better piece for the price point
this is one awesome guitar
i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination
the only problem in my household is
who gets to play next
i am very happy with the guitar
it came well padded and was in excellent shape
it was set up well and has played well out of the box
played as well after the change as it did before
first off the shipping was fantastic
it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition
it is an extremely well made and solid product
it plays well and the sound
i cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good
if youre thinking aout buying this guitar dont
itd been about 6 years since ive had an electric guitar
i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned
it came in perfect condition
the action is set perfectly and i dont have any issues with buzzing strings
but overall this is a great guitar
it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp
because well 0o it is a lp
its no gibson but it is a lp
very happy with this purchase
purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that
still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar
looks great and plays great
only needed minor setup adjustments
i would recommend getting strap locks
i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this
i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak
but this little baby is now my second favorite
my other review was not fair
i paid a lot more for the gibson and 149 bucks for this epiphone
dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal
this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price
the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul
its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound
after all if i ding this one up i havent broke the bank
i think ill tend to use this one a lot more than the other
i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge
plus ill get another one in a different color
you can never have too many guitars
i am going to an a pickguard to this one
the finish on it is outstanding and id like to keep it that way
this is a beautiful guitar
and the tone is very clear
if you cant afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul
this is a fun and very good guitar for the money
has 6 stringsfrom e to e
and if you know the g chord you will have lots of fun
epiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar ebonyhello again
my other favorite is a dean electric 12 string
whats also amazing is that its still around a 150
its well worth the noney
it stays in tune and it high quality
i just purchased an electricacoustic epiphone ukelele today for my chiropractor
i will review that later
if you are looking for a les paul guitar this is not one
its still a very nice guitar though
very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners
i highly recommend this guitar
ive been playing for over 40 years
i currently own 60 or so guitars
they are beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play
little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bit
note it played well the way i got it just like my stuff perfect
it cut through really well
the tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice
please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut
this also has a bolt on neck
a lot of players say you have to have a set glued neck
oh did i mention this is a very good looking guitar
i got this pretty fast
first the tuner issues that ive been reading about
i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune
the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle
if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal
must have been built on a friday afternoon or something
nowafter i did this it is sweet
the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all
i bought this to sell mainly but now
the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it
otherwise id highly recommend a more expensive model
the 299 models are great right out of the box usually
i really couldnt find anything wrong  with it
but you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you
the pickups are surprisingly good
the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls
out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase
now im glad i chose this one
for one thing this is a guitar ill always enjoy having around
there is nothing cheap or toylike about it
in 23 years my tastes may change
had i gone with a more expensive model id feel locked in
mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body inside
kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there
will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had
so add 10 to get more than 30 minute in tune play here
electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are important
you lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning
so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that
its likely theyll keep this style but revise it some
otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups
pretty sweet guitar for the price
sounds like and plays like a les paul
i just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference
overall sounds and looks awesome
imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability
you literally cannot find a better guitar for 150 than the special 2
the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect
the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic
not sure which they have
so much sustain for a bolt on neck
build quality 45i did have 1 problem with the high e tuner
no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness
neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed
damn good for a bolt on
the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup
no pickguard and it doesnt need one
lots of relief between strings and body
you wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick
makes it easy to clean too
truss rod is behind a nice body color plate
frets were smooth rounded and played nice
could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough
neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to
500k pots and side body 14 trplug keeps the cable out of the way
it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box
i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music
i did blues metal country and pop
this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain
what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere
i ended up putting the screws back in
this guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box
i am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth
i am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading
so expect it to be a different color than what you order
it comes with strings installed and almost tuned
the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use
i will say that its very easy to play
everything on it is very adjustable which i also like
my expectations were frankly low
other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability
and if it gets banged up so what
it costs a buck thirty
im updating a previous negative review
i had some issues with this guitar when it arrived
i missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered
setup is finished and i can now agree with most reviewers
i know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile
ill add it back to my own collection and upgrade the electronics
ill never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this
first of all it is a beauty
my guitar was made in china which may account for the darker hue
second this instrument is no lightweight either in heft or playability
it is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream
i cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up
my initial impression was somewhat mixed
they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing
i sat down plugged it in and played a bit
instantly i was in love
epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar
i point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and gibson electronics
my son practically ran to the ups man when the truck pulled up
he is thrilled with this guitar
works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears
it would not seat properly and would slide out
second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy
this is my third circuit breaker cable
it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise
the switch is easy to use
so far i am a very satisfied customer with this cable
try it out for yourself
ive had it just over a month so amazon wont help me
amazon support referred me to the manufacturer
i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly
the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined
wow these cables are made really sturdy
and the noiseless feature is priceless
definitely a real good value for the money
the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip
the actual cable is horrible
they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre
i only use 34 pedals and this is always one of them
it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space
the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds
you will not regret this purchase
ive tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound
i have no complains about it
definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard
you get the best bang for your buck with boss products
tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect
liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads
this pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out
you have to get this pedal
sweet chorus i have the ce5 the ce20 a ce3 and this one
and it is the best bet for the money
i like the product a lot
for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect
it is not so long as i thought
i though it would be like the pianos sustainer
but its a good pedal effect
my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect
i completely agree with that
and it will sustain your notes
it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain
i use the ns2 when i use my chain of pedals
that said this pedals has some wonderful uses
every note will have the same volume
you can set it to sustain for days
again you will need a noise gate
perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do
i recommend messing with it quite a while
you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it
for me this is perfect doesnt make any noise with my conections
those compliments apply equally to the cs3 compression sustainer
however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know
boss is the company that dominates my effects board
it did what i wanted  then some
guitarists have become a bunch of corksniffers
frankly id forgotten how musical this pedal is
with the gain at halfway you get great addc crunch
what more could you want
sure its old school rock distortion
the usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe
think of this as an artists tool
and for every job there is the right tool
is this the best distortion pedal
if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles
it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians
its built like a brick and durable as all getout
i found mine used for 20 but the new asking price is fair
it distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though
this does just what it says it does
one volume knob one tone and one distortion knob
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board
thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best
its still in my primary set up
for those looking for insane crunch this isnt for you
anyone that wants a nice versatile pedal this is the one you want
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron
this is a distortion pedal
its pretty harsh in tone  kind of a white noise distortion
the ds1 does not warm up the tone in your amp
you can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh sounding
that said  the ds1 does exactly what i wanted it to
my amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style
its boss so it will last forever
th only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere
buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone
i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass
ive played guitar for over 10 years
like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds1
so i snapped one up just like everyone else
so i plugged it in and didnt really care for it
the distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy
but like many newer players i didnt know any better at the time
fast forward a few years and ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals
a very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many
pro co rat2   great dirty distortion pedal
its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy
ive never heard a bad tone out of mine
very big saturated and warm
basically its a preamp that sits on the floor
its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass
a true hidden gem thats actually cheaper than a ds1
joyo jf03 crunch distortion   this little guy surprised me
hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for
find something you truly love and buy that
heres the deal with this pedal
honestly the best effect it held was the phaserjet pipe effect
i got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted
it does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price
pros  inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal
cons  lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast
without the excessive hum and almostunusable tone control this would get 4 stars
inexpensive to purchase  easy to mod to your liking
this pedal received the gain and jcm mod
this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost
theres some element of nostalgia with the ds1 that ive just never understood
i know theyre incredibly durable as are all boss pedals
its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way
ive used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps
fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers
that just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time
same goes for the boss ds1
mine is modified with the monte allums trigain rectifier modification and its absolutely killer
but as a platform for greatsounding mods you cant go wrong
this is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound
its very easy to use and rugged
the ds1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal
i am glad i got the ds1 but for other reasons
in closing spend the 40 buck and get this
if you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here
for the price this pedal is a good deal though
ive had this for about 11 years now
not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there
any number of mods can be found online to change the sound
theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which im happy with
ive always liked the parametric eq on this pedal
the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors
for most metalhard rock music the gain range is enough for me
even without a boost i can use it for death metal
this pedal is great only a couple notes i should make about it
this pedal is for metal
the battery drains like a mf
i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries
other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal
i have a lot of pedals
this pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound
instead its very edgy and smooth as can be
it has a midsweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone
i usually use it as a midboost for solos
im sure the huge boss distortion box comes close but for the price
i bought mine used three years ago and it works great
it works for a metallica pantera type sound
you can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq
by far the best distortion pedal out there
several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it
i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal
there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion
overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be
for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet
tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard
however there is a downside
pedals are not budget friendly
it gives a variety of sounds
it will help you tame this pedal into what you want
perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot
ive seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz
within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt2
surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board
the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eqd for saturated distortion
i also other boss distortion pedals
bought it as a gift
friend loved it very much
this one is a good meet in the middle of those two
as always this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy
this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years
very simple very userfriendlyand the feature that is most important i think versatile
and also for the money a great deal
i first used this pedal when my green screemer died
a friend had and os2 on hand and let me use it
i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason
i cant stop using it
for the money i have no complaints
the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable
not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are
as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals
you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right
thats just not what it was intended to do
it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv
its yellow its metal its boss
the best od i have ever owned
makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half
as with any other boss pedals its well made and reliable
this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever
smooth tone the right amount of gain perfect to push a tube amp
these pedals last forever and i only paid 20 for mine
this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver
it is tough sounds like fire and will serve you well
for 50 there is seriously no better deal
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds1
i held out from trying the boss sd1 super overdrive for many years
the sd1 is widely owned and very affordable usually around 50
theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedals
however the sd1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility
you can simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel
try the underappreciated md2 mega distortion or the excellent joyo ultimate drive
great as a booster as others have said
for solos itll boost your mids and your signal
as an overdrive its great kind of a midsy marshally sound
its a boss its solid  and a great price
remember this is overdrive  not distortion
for distortion look at other boss pedals
for a long time i overlooked my sd1 and used other pedals
it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more
the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about 45 on amazon
at that price its an amazingly good deal
what this produces is smooth oldstyle overdrive
it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus
ive used the sd1 with both singlecoil and doublecoil pickups
both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker
but it sounds great with singlecoils too
forget all the volume drop comments
there isnt any and it does not color your tone one bit
i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals
they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in
and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on
definitely worth the reasonable cost
the price was also very good
this is a great tremolo pedal
tremolo varies the volume of the sound
it does not vary the pitch
there is no onoff clicking when depressed
there is no added hiss hum or distortion
the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything
ive played this pedal for a while now and really dig it
this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b3 type of organ sound
2 its very sturdyan oftennoted feature of boss pedals
i paid about 75 for mine and have zero regrets
plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo
most tremolos have it but not all
i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine
if it didnt i would not buy boss product period
wanted a way to plug in my boss me70 to save on batteries
its a power adaptor so it isnt too exciting but it works fine
works very well with no problems
and you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hours
a very good deal at 15 clams
you can now plug it into the wall
is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
no more battery swaps no more searching for a 9volt every 5 minutes
got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this
they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great
i already own two and had no problems
buy it if you need a wall wart
my first wah was a morley steve vai bad horsie
its a switchless pedal that i put through hell
thats when i went looking at the cry baby
at the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up
i paid 97tax for my gcb95 cry baby and it was worth every penny
i dont even touch my morley anymore
ive been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now
to me these always feel perfect
no complaints with the crybaby
i got this pedal cause is not so expensive and i love music
now thats a fun king wah wah
it sounds exactly like how i always imagined like in all those records
this one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone
more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs
i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah
i kinda think i am
its a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder
in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist
wawa pedals come and go and get modded and rethunk
but i always wanted an original cry baby
so this was a birthday gift to myself
very good buy great packaging earlierthanexpected delivery  thanks amazon
this pedal covers the 34white room34 by cream tone perfectly
i gave it 4 stars because it hasnt been maintenance free
great pedal and it is still built like a tank
you cant really do that with this pedal
this is my first petal of  any kind
this wah petal is so much fun
you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow
it is hours and hours of fun
i have had no problem with performance
it works as it should
i highly recommend this petal
its price is attractive as well
i really cant find any negative about it
its just a perfect standard wah
you wont regret this purchase at all
just put a good analog fuzz after it  youre good to go
ive got a mxr mc404 cae for my concert line pedals
a great pedal well made
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
for metal artists i would recommend looking elsewhere
this wah pedal just doesnt cut it
as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal
my mom bought me this one
i thought it was awesome until i learned better
there is a big drop in the freq
you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop
the mark tremonti wah is great
kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use
what i use for wah is the digitech rp250 processor
if you want a cheap childs gimictype toy this is for you
want to get serious about a wah
spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere
ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now
that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time
those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat
a classic that will surely live on
the orig still the best
do you like guitar music
chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes
the cry baby has proven itself since the 60s
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board
if thats not a problem definitely worth the price
some things just dont need to change
its a must have and thats really all there is to say
like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it
i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one
i am using this on my martin 12string
the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand
best 12string capo i have ever usedand thats over decades
this is my 6th kyser capo
this one for my new ovation 12 string cc245 is what i needed
i always recommend all kyser capos
they last forever and do not lose the strong holds
if you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one
just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need
this capo does exactly what it should
it works and is my second favorite
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
my favorite is still the g7th capo
this is a close second to the g7th
my only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for amazon prime
update   i just saw that this capo is eligible for amazon prime
free shipping for prime members
for the price and quality this kyser capo works on a uke
works great stays out of the way
cant ask for much more than that
and expect to get it the price was half of what i was locally
it seems to hold tight
it wont budge once you clip it and its low profile
made of metal it should last a lifetime
sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side away from me the player
but it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones
i have several of these capos one for each instrument
works great with my baritone ukulele
same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo
easily fits in my ukulele case too
its a very cute little capo
i use this capo all the time on both instruments
a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also
i did and they love it
i have several types of capos this one seems well built
a little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it
its a good banjo capo
inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo
they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do
you can never go wrong with a kyser
not only that i like the idea that its an us company
ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job
this kyser will last a long long time
ive been using one of these kysers for a good while now
this is such a nice bag for the price
there is a handle and a shoulder strap
all my guitars have these locks on them and im very satisfied
in particular i favor the dual design
all three of them have held up with no issues
then again i dont tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as
so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand
i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky
the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me
these have pegs that insert
but if it happens there will be an update to this
good product so far just wouldnt recommend it
the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic
not on my newer sg thoughat least with the new screws it comes with
fender start appears to take the system wellonly time will tell
yes if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine
i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars
but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem
best strap locks ive ever used dunlop has always had great products
its easier to strap up because of the quick release tab
this should be every bassistguitarists best friend
glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig
these strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat
ive tried a few different straplock options and these are the best
great product ive use them before and have always thought they were top quality
easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connecthold very solid
its not that hard though and the reward is worth it
no complaints about this hardware
easy to install with patience easy to use
these work like a light switch
onoff so im not sure how you can rate them as poor
its not rocket science to make them work
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric736 lbs
just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly
i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation
money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground
besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars
if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars
theydont get in the way when being used but look almost out of place
that is why i chose black for mysecond set
helps keep the products profile down a bit
other than that the product works asadvertised
do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure
grab a set you wont be disappointed
this product is a must
because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable
and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure
i have two sets of these for my straps
the push button action is most convenient vs
fighting stubborn leather openings especially if new
the gold finish matches my instruments hardware and they are sturdy and durable
its worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these
does what it says it will do  keeps your strap locked on
i have had zero issues with these
the installation takes 2 minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play
these dunlop straploks are amazing
very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals
they rotate in full circles and are super durable
they are also very easy to use and 34install34
this is the first time ive used the dunlop straploks system
ive always used the competition
these work just as well
whats great about the dunlop design they work
we will never run anything other than this design going forward
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
easy to install on the guitar
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well
they are easy to install on the bass and the strap
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg
i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out
here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller 1 bulky
i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out
schallers click in and you know they are ready to go
for a few bucks more ill stick with schallers
i have been using them for 10 years and have never seen one fail
i have not had one fail on me ever
its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product
a workaround for the main issue follows the review
however a standard 2 driver is too big to fit into the strapbuttons
the strap button has a radius about 316ths of an inch
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each
sorry i dont like these as theyre just too big
they stand out too much
they do work and theyre effective but they are too pronounced
again they work but theyre not aesthetic nor elegant
i did manage to get it on
however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar
quick snap on and off
if it is not convenient it wont be used
well worth the money spent
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy
i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon
the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance
ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences
schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players
installed on two guitars and i love them
great product would recommend to any guitar player
i have these on all my guitars
only problem is the clip on install to the strap
once installed you are good for life
i know this is a great product
ive had a set before
the product comes in a clam shell package
the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return
that said ill say again the straplok system is a great product
i know ive owned another set for more than twenty years
a little story to back these locks integrity
i installed them on a korean made washburn wg587v
i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying
the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder
the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar
attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system
fast to take on and off of your guitar
also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps
i always felt 100 secure with these straplocks
they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot
this is a must have just buy it
im in love with the dual design system
it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly
there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time
i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these
i have used dunlop straplocks for 32 years
i suggest these over the other brands  watch what touring bands use
these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch
the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping
i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping
good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery
better than going to the always overpriced guitar center
buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts
seems really sturdy and well made
i went a long time convincing myself that i didnt need these
i still check but they just wont pull out or release
these guys are rocksolid and really easy to install
i have these on my jazz bass my guitar player has another brand
bending down picking them up then throwing
its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage
ive done it  it sucked
have them on four guitars
watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok
might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses
and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use
these are really great guitar locks
these work just like you want them to
but a new strap and put these on right away
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks
i would recommend them to all
again i feel line i work for dunlop
i dont just love the products
i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these
handsdown i like the dunlop ones more
they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure
i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago
i put a pair of these on every guitar that i own
inside of the box it came with 2 screw sizes
and after 30 years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished
i have used that other sbrand on other instruments and really prefer the dunlops
i recently built a bass myself and i install this one
its very easy to install very straight forward to use it
it holds my jazz bass without any problem
i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars
they are the only ones i trust
they are solid secure and they look great
and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security
this the second set of strap locks that ive owned
the quick release and secure connection are great
overall they work really well and look sharp
they fit perfectly on my schecter hellraiser
very happy with my purchase
the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes
i would not do that without this straplok
theyre easy to install i havent had one fail on me yet
i cant recommend them highly enough
the best i8217ve used so far
i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy
however once clipped properly you shouldnt have issues
strings are half the battle with stringed instruments
either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point
i bought a ukulele  to give as a present
this was an easy choice for me
there are other excellent strings available
this just was my choice this time
over the years ive tried several different brands of string
the truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them
great guitar companies dont always make or sell under their aegis the best strings
i love my teles but i cant stand fender strings
aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound
then switch to aquilas for playing
some may like the martins but few wont love the aquilas
nice materials and i think it will be durable
simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed
i have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on
just one more affordable improvement for the home studio
only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline
these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy
overall stays in place and does its job well
dont even hesitate buying this thing
it gets the job done
for the price this is the perfect pop filter
really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile
attaches firmly and does the job
cant beat it for the price
order this with eyes closed
what else is there to say
this really eliminated many subtle flaws i had with audio recording
granted you can make a makeshift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon
but the adjustable clamp is really
well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations
filter works very well and looks professional
the thing is that they dont seem to stay
and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality
but i think if youre lucky if just might get the job done
this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me
but i see that most are the same
just pop filtering through black pantyhose
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless
wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh
here are my pros and cons pros1
i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter
the pop sound is completely removed with the filter
which means it does what it was designed to do
attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product
the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately
the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface
i dont know why people think this isnt sturdy
i cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it
now its become a permanent member of the front of my desk
i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought
what could possibly go wrong
i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new
when i order something new i expect it to be new
based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller
it does exactly what its supposed to do
removes those annoying popping ps out of your recordings
and the price was right too
why else would you be reading this
besides it wont look this good
ive purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months
the most recent one i purchased was not this one
i thought id try something different just to see the differences
the competitors that ive tried do not
a single dot of superglue fixed that
and yes pop filters are a must with condenser microphones
just buy one now save yourself the trouble
it does what its supposed to do
its as well made as most i think
they all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade
the screen pops out easily but it will pop back in
it works well for my home recording
this is a decent pop filter
it gets the job done but it has a few flaws
it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in
other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price
under 10 wouldve been better
does not stay in place well
finally i just went with this one and im pretty happy with it
it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough
i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it
it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances
when you record singing you need this to prevent the pop sound
it is definitely worth it
it also makes you looks professional
its got a nice look too
use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work
this was a great investment for my home studio
ive been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone
i should of bought this a long time ago
not much else to say
but other than that works as intended
i love this pop filter
for the price this is one of the best pop filters
it easily clamps onto my stand and doesnt move around after i place it
however there is one problem ive had with it
it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter
granted this was caused by me dropping it once but before it was fine
so for a good price you get a filter that works
it mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need
a needed accessory for any vocal recording period
hell even my cats cant do that and theyre porcelain
it hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised i
e removes the pops from vocal recordings
very sturdy and awesome pop filter
adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter
i would recommend this to anyone
this filter arrived very quickly
these are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality
good quality cable and price
works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables
otherwise i use this cable at every show
looks vintage but works great at a great price
as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them
i love their flexibility options for colors and ends build quality and price
got this short cord to go from amp to waa
by the way the oldschool tweed look is a plus too
well what can i say
based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a nobrainer
and before you ask 34is it perhaps your output jack
34 all of my other cables work with my geetar
i bought this right angle 10 red cable for my older ibanez guitar
i recommend this cable without reservations
they are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems
i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case
ive posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page
this cable works perfect for its purpose
and it matches my tweed amp
this is a pretty strong cable
the angle does the job
seams strong  seams like it will last
ive owned them for a few months now
no issues at all and they look good
this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass
i only use something different if i need a longer reach
and i love the tweed cover
very satisfied with this one
the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus
might work well for recording too when you take the output jack
im opting for the convenience of the size
i like the brit setting
i sound like a rock star with it
good product for practice or recording
you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig
but for around the same price you could get a fender amp
this product works for me and the quality is pretty good
other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this
there are several types of practice amps
the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v22 peavey valveking etc
these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality
and then there are the micros
it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear
hes not a big kid so even 15lb
amps are pushing itplus a gig bag and school back pack
that was initially what brought me to the micro
not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso
turns out this is an amazing amp
the tone destroys the line 6 and the features crush the vox pathfinder 6watt
and the fender frontman  not even in the ballpark
each of the models are distinct
the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate
obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad
you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes
dont let the size fool you
quality sounding and durable for a great price
i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker
first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying
i wish theyd just name the settings 34clean34 34overdrive34 34distortion34 and so on
jc clean black panel brit combo and rfier mean nothing to me
then theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed
a 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the back
lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy
none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying
overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3
i bought this amp to replace a squier sp10 that came with my guitar
the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button
the effects are better than id hoped for
i dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries
we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it
we are using an mp3 player for backup
guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features
the microcube came with new ac adaptor that supports 110v and 240v
now i can take it along and use it in europe asia and usa
i saved 30 from buying another ac adapter that supports 240v
a good solid piece of equipment
it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful
it came as well packed as a brandnew guitar and looks like one
tone control didnt work so it was returned
the sound is lets say
good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups
but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style
cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks
this guitar will make a player proud
for the money you cant find a better deal
i am currently overseas and didnt want to bring my good guitar along
i bought this at guitar center and now wish that i hadnt
now on to the guitar itself
the sound from this sg is true to its big brother from gibson
awesome crunch and great sustainability
i can take or leave the kill pot
the electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing
im not complaining i just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups
for 169 you cant expect to have the top of the line
to sum it up i love this guitar
i keep in e flat tuning and it stays
this was was better then i expected
in other words great all around
you will not be disappointed
i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day
maybe it is my locations but that was great too
highly recommend to everyone looking for a case
bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter
the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected
beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle
solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge
basically this case is very sharp looking  made with good quality materials
the inside of the one i received was grey fur
nice enough that i wouldnt check it at the airport
survived a trip in a moving van from philly to boston
this case it built really well it has really nice plush interior
above all it fits my epi lp perfectly
its a tight fitting case
when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar
it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic
i am sure i received a new case
being perfectly  protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it so
as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means
my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit
with this said over time there is a possibility of wear
i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail
overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul
i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be
i will edit in the future if necessary
very nice case for the price
solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp
hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty
this case is the best ive ever had
very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong
the handle extreamly soft to the touch
i guess all my other cases just dont measure up to this one
but this for the quality
the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories
the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used
otherwise great case highly recommended
i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly
he says its great so that is my review
prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping
4 stars is my tops anywhere
very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable
im not much for brand names on my guitar cases
i figure it tells wouldbe thieves what theyre getting
i sprayed a little matteblack paint over the epiphone logo
the case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush
it fits my line 6 jtv variax in a very cozy way
great case for small cash
good deal for the price
as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more
if youre toating between practice with an instructor its okay
i purchased it for that reason
and im an adult so i can be careful
this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage
i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag
it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent  dirt but thats it
not many frills to this bag
if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it
this bag fits my epiphone les paul ii electric guitar very well
but no room to spare
i prefer a bigger pocket but aside from that i cant complain
this gig bag looks really sharp and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying
good quality bag for my epi lp
this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul
their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover
i tossed it aside and bought a fender gigbag
the fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection
at lt20 this is a great bargain but it is a very basic bag
it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying
these are also easily removed if they bother you
couldnt ask for more in a momentary switch
like all boss products it will probably last longer than me
i got this for use with the boss dd20 as a taptempo
i got this for my boss loop station but it doesnt work very well
i keep hoping ill find something it does work well with
great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
im using this footswitch to control a drum machine
i could not beat the price
the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal
also it not to big
it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board
very happy with this item
like the option of nc or no
a cheap guitar doesnt always mean a pos
i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it
i got way more than i bargained for
i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited
i knew i had to go cheap at least for now
i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars
plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general
well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed
i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable
i see that some of the other reviewers disagree
maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference i dont know
it doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either
this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps
and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets
there isnt much about it that would give away its price
i dont regret this purchase at all
i doubt youll be disappointed
pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did
one user even claimed epiphone should sue him
check out the video reviews by the userscompanies goldhat3 samashmusic giggear and shadowfw
my only complaint about this guitar is that i didnt buy it sooner
good luck on your search i hope this review has helped
i did not  expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitar
when i unboxed this guitar i was floored
the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far
the guitar sings beautifully the tone is rich and vibrant
i have received many compliments on the look of it already
over all  this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag
this is not my first guitar
heres what it is  an exceedingly wellconstucted amazingly playable guitar
fit finish feel and action were all very nice
sound on the other hand
its a fine 34first34 guitar
its a great beachcampingcabin guitar
leave it in your car to practice at lunch
leave it in the office
any guitar is better than no guitar
and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars
seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box
new premium strings do make a difference
if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you wont be disappointed
if sound quality is your primary concern well
for my desired application this guitar was great
im very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat
it is my sons first guitar and he is learning on it well
it is still in great condition
action is low but does not buzz very easy to chord
i highly recomend this guitar
well constructed with quality woods saddlenut and bracing
neck and frets are straight level and do not snag
this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight
enough grip to stay put in hands well too
i tried this but ended up going back to tortex
i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends
the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly
ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid
i own 5 different gauges
i like the gripping surface
90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast
guitar picks make a huge part of your tone
these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion
they have a long life and do brighten your tone
once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different
much more grainy and tiny but that may be a plus for you
they stay in your fingers well
but i prefer the 114 sharps over these
these ultex are much better
not as noisy better feel
ill have them with me for spares
i bought the wrong gauge
90 gauge at guitar center and love them
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new
i love the pick attack with these
60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic dunlop pick
i find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold
some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use
if that turns out to be a problem i might reconsider my review
grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones
stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely
not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great
this pick however takes it to the next level
very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick
73 for acoustic and the same holds true
this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewines books and it works great
it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop
the effect isnt as noticeable on darker finishes though
i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great
the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light
ive been using this polish since the early 80s
wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars
martin knows what theyre doing
i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes
used it once but once was enough
cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue
made my little martin look almost as good as new
i bought this for my son to clean his guitar with
he really likes it a lot
it works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth
i would buy this product again
the built in volume knob it a great tough
either way once plugged in it sounds great
this pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a blueridge br160
this is not a bad product just not great
installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes
my problems with it are 3 fold   1
even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy
i use it for practice and recording myself
i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good
these are probably the most wellknown pads available and probably the best
ok so i just installed these things for my krk 6s no stands
just sitting on two other speakers
the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again
my stereo image even feels wider now
sure theyre a little pricy but hey
im happy with the reults my 40 got me
these really do work great
if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know
these mopads are pretty amazing
these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing
its like im using actual studio monitors
at 40 you cant go wrong with these pads for you studio
it is a must to have these
these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors
and they look professional too
i didnt hear it when i mixed my hafler m1 speakers
he said he loved them
it was an immediate difference
the bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there
i immediately bought a 2nd set for my small hafler speakers
why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately
all and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference
these strings are very bright and full
they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead
the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money
they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them
ive been trying different strings for years
ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change
these are very bright and clean
i knew i had found 34my strings34 after a short time playing with these
they are light on the fingers sound great and priced right
some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics
depending on your style these might be a good choice
but as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from martin
but its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them
i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic
these are one of the best strings ive used
im a blues guitarist so they take a beating well
very much worth the cost and i thank amazon for having them
these are good strings for a good price
but these seemed to work well on the guitar i was restringing
my son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more
i dont ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are
these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion
they play extremely well and last a long time
theres nothing better than these strings
i have a 1993 taylor which is in mint condition
i always use martin on any acoustic
every acoustic is different though
many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo
so when my strings wear out i got this
yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like seagulls
if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string
these are a littl ehard to play
these were purchased for my sons guitar
i plan on buying him another set of them for christmas
i really like the mediums
ive got at least 6 spares at home right now
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings
they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly
ive used these strings for quite a while now
they have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity
these are nice and sturdy picks
im having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings
i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics
finally found the right one
they are your regular picks
will order again if needed
i have tried few picks textured mallow color and this bright green
they last forever and have a great grip
73 mm picks  i would consider them medium thickness
73 mm is right for me i really like them
have used them for years
feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever
i know that pick choosing is a personal matter
i choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me
i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect
great picks for beginners and pros alike
go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing
i think tortex  delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by
durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color
then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better
take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean
ive been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time
the tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones i can find
i like the soft sandy feel of these
i like the picks a lot
the 10mm tortex picks are blue
anyway ive been playing guitar for about 15 years
ive been using the blue tortex picks for about 14
durability wise ill lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out
whatever size you are looking for dunlop is the best option
it lasts long sounds great and feels very nice
it is probably the most favored pick among all companies
either way dunlop is the best and for a great price
they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackityclack noise
dunlop ultex picks sound much better
thankfully i still have most of these picks
its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these
ive been using these picks for 10 years theyve always been great
between these blues and the yellow im covered
the flex is just right for me and they last forever
i have never had one break
if you dont know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack
picks make a big difference to sound and playability
these are thin and flexible
easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general
however the tone is different
so youll need to decide what songs they work for etc
as far as quality these are great
easy to grip and as durable as most
good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly
these things are great and yes i can shred faster now
i use the dunlop tortex 114mm purples
i like the dunlops feel grip and durability
they hold up for a very long time
i have had some last a few years
they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability
i think these are great for the price they give you
ive used these picks for years with great results
if youve never used this stile picks you wont be sorry
they stil play great sound great against steel strings and last a long time
these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently
if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice
grip is good and the thickness is just right for me
the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference
60 dunlop tortex is perfect
the surface is matte and not too slick
ill probably be buried with one in my hand
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box
i always keep a lot of these on hand
the weight is great for my style of playing
they seem more durable than other brands
i love em use them daily and rely on them
i have one thats over 4 years old and still going strong
i love these picks for playing my acoustic
for me i prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric probably a
80 but i still like the tortex picks for that as well
and these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply
these guitar picks are just the best
i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex
i use the green 88mm picks and also the orange 60mm ones
i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks
great for beginners or the pros
i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time
i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks
they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the
88 mm picks for that
cant go wrong with tortex
very easy to grip and last long
highly recommand this for anyone needs pick
these are such comfortable picks
this is subtle yet effective
they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them
fair priced and i love the color of the green ones
cheap and easy to use cant beat these picks
i have always used tortex picks
if you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin
this is the pick i learned to play with
great feel doesnt slip in sweaty fingers
i have been using dunlop picks for a long time
good feel grip and not too heavy or thick
my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these
but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent
hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks
ever since i started playing the guitar ive used the nylon dunlop picks
theyre better in a thicker size 10mm or larger but the
73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick
i bought these because i wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming
i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming
i like thin picks myself and this one is very thin
i give them a thumbs up
awesome for chord based songs
still these are nice picks
theyre very thin nylon picks
cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and dont break
end up losing them verses breaking
the quality control is so so
ill stick with dunlop gator grip
96mm or prs 10 picks
for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks
yes i think you should try these
if youre looking at them then get them
these have been my favorite picks for decades now
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
maybe 5 times in my entire career
rapidlyfirmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet
the edge is now smooth and nice
they are flexible but not flimsy
the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks
however theyre definitely still usable after that
one other advantage these picks have is that they never break
so i dont see how you can go wrong
been using these for years
always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases
they are not too stiff or too flimsy
they work good for the sound on the strings
easy to hold on to
the celluloid one fell apart quickly so i wanted a better material
these white nylon picks should last a lot longer
but you can do it
this is still my favorite pick for strumming
ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists
i also really like the nylon material
i like the playability of the
88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues
i keep a stack of
60mm for a more raw folk like sound
this is thicker than the
you cant go wrong here
60mm nylon picks as my current standard  but decided to give the lighter
this nylon pick has great play feel
it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords
if you hate droping your pick while playingget these
im satisfied with these picks
this picks are comfortable nice quality
very forgiving on technique also
for a number of reasons
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these
i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area
not too much but at least something
these super light flexible nylon picks are great if youre trying to play quietly
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s
they have never let me down
very comfortable in the hand
im not sure what else to say
the picks work well and they dont wear out easily
much better than plastic ones especially if you stay in the light thickens
and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing
and the price is right too
for a number of reasons
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
i dont like a pick that is to stiff and i like the grip
my hands sweat a lot so i really need the grip
60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick
im an irishstyle dadgad guitarist
these picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms
im starting to lean towards the tortex
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
maybe 5 times in my entire career
the max grips have a much better grip
i like a flexible pick and these at
they are also in a good color so they dont stand out too much
when i play faster songs thick gauge picks are very easy to lose
so i like to play with thin gauge picks
even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same
60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the same
would i try another pick if the chance was presented
60 nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection
these just happen to be my favorite
60s ive been using them for years and so will probably never change
i like the grippiness of them
soundwise i dont find that theyre significantly different from any other pick
if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my 1
ive been using the dunlop delrin 500 20 picks
purple ones with the turtle500 on them
i thought i had found my pick
at the music store i stumbled on the dunlop gator grip 20
but since i solved that problem with the honing stone i was more curious
500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter
grips soft loose and yet well
i own hundreds of picks
these are some of my favorites
ive been playing for more than 30 years
i use the 15 mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years
the nonslip surface doesnt take long to wear off but i have a workaround
ive even put them in a vice and filed new points on them
i prefer an extra heavy pick because theres no delay from pick deflection
you cant go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick
this pick is great for strumming
that was not the case
the entire material and holding surface is the same material
also they werent as large as i expected
they are still usable as decent picks
im glad i tried these i wont order them again
edit  im nothing if not fair
i stand by that review
however now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect
ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars
i will buy these again
i changing my review from just okay to contextually perfect
ok ill add a star your right i should add a star
these picks were no different from picks without the 34gator grip34 imho
but gorilla snot worked beautifully
first i love these picks and used them exclusively for years
i have dozens of them they never wear out
they are very comfortable and easy to control
now the bad  the sound
if all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue
i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them
these big stubby picks have solved that problem
definitely worth the little extra they cost
these picks are translucent purple
other than the strange color they are good picks
they really do help with speed and accuracy
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products
some say that the grip is good
heres my take  for what its worth
ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars
round and flat wound strings
compared to the tortex style pick material 1 mm for the tortex
also note i play with the rounded edge not the tip
i find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars im currently playing
the process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time
give these a try and let me know what you think
these  picks  r awsome
if u have hand problems  try these
i dont know why they are called big stubby
they are on the small side
way to thick for me
they do sound good though and will last a long time
i feel like i am playing with a nickle
helps the grip a lot
i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness
still looking for the right picks for me
if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again
but only thumb picks work so i can use my fingers too
the picks have almost zero flex to them meaning the player has solid control
i like emeven if they are purple
but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you
the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material
pick wearing is virtually nonexistent and i utilize altpicking a lot in my practices
i highly recommend for the shred guitarist
you can get these in 24 packs at
sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on
i have them in purple which makes them stick out
already planning on purchasing more
at around 450 for six picks these are some expensive pieces of plastic
i will definitely be buying more
id recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like
i first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks
my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks
well be buying these for a long time to come
another item never received but i would not use anything over
88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase
the right pick is a personal preference
nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick but its not for me
i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect
so just make sure you get the right one
when you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost
eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one
im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard
keeping the pick clean and dry does help
time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick
the pick pack contains 24 picks
i only paid 299 which is simply an outstanding deal
using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks
you simply play faster no matter what level you are
alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flatpick drag
24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain
you pay twice as much in a store
as a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks
ive been playing guitar my entire life
and ive tried almost every pick there is
after hearing how great it is i decided to buy it
it felt really small at first and i kinda was dissapointed
i put it down and didnt use it for quite some time
and i no longer had to worry about the pick slipping
i cant really go back to normal sized picks now
thats like the only downside i can think of
if these dont work for you you can always buy the vpick
its kinda small for my hand but it works great
its more easier to pick the string
this pack comes with 6 picks
these are shred picks they are very accurate
the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked
they dont play at all like what i was expecting
im sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop
lets hope this is just a shortterm fluke
great for lead playing and with small fingers like i have they feel great
these are the best picks out there
if you dont have these already you better purchase them now
black or red the color is the only difference
i do like this pick as well
its the third color of the same pick i purchased
i will probably always use these
give these picks three days and youllnever go back to another style
this pick literally makes you play better
way to stiff and small for me though
great attack but holding onto it is the problem
i imagine it would work great for lead players but im a rhythm player
nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time
one of my favorite picks ive tried for electric
dont enjoy them as much on acoustic
they are half the size of a regular pick
bit too thick for me
wish i had sized them before i bought them
i love these little guys
they have a nice textured grip
i used to use fender medium picks only
now for jazz and metal i use this pick
and now my personal debate continues
i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is
i like tortex and this isnt but
i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips
this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get
i like the thickness of this pick
easy to hang onto when strumming
love the tone i can obtain too
the title says it all
i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review
if amazon used halfstars i would have given them 355
switching to these was not a problem at all
sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems
by far the biggest change was the 34pointyness34 of the picks
everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion
its especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming
34 it really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing
could i play faster with them
could i pull off amazing licks that i couldnt do with my normal picks
i tried them but didnt like them
i dont and they arent for me
same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor
i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythmlead work is required
for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better
i bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out
the gel in the name sounded intriguing
i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably
my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs
i would recommend these to anyone
the bright colors make them difficult to lose
i like fender mediums always have but i gotta branch out man
not sure about these picks yet
the feel a little more stiff my usual
i want them to last longer
these sounded different gel picks
i do not like them
being see through distracts me
they are a little scratchy on the edges
dunlop also makes quality picks and i have yet to break one of these
they last a long time
now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these
but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick
always great products and always dependable
i also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo
not one product has let me down yet
my capo is 8 years old
it does its job and does it ok for my taste
i love these pick holders
theyre easy to get on and off
they hold a nice amount of picks
and you get that rockstar feel throw picks at the audience
a must for any gigging guitarist
holds my picks in place  nicely
snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly
never come up short again
i have the small version
i used in all my concerts and its excellent
fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks
it does what its supposed to do what else can i say
highly recommended also fits on my guitar stand very cool
there isnt much to say about this product except it works as advertised
dont know why i waited so long to get one
this pick holder is awesome
it just snaps on to your mic stand
add 6 picks and start rockin
i put it on the boom of my mic stand
tight on some not on others
if you cant find a container and add your own sponge then buy this
keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential
i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better
check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp
i use them all winter long in my guitars
no frills just a simple concept that works
this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe
purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative
with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use
distilled water will extend the life of the sponge
however i may have added too much humidity
this makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier
makes the whole house safer for the martins
a sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too
just dont get water on the wood
i actually bought three of them
cut them to size and stuff them in
dont worry about the 34thing34 hanging inbetween your strings
the device is simple and fairly solid
treat it gently and it will last forever
you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher
try to keep the sponge moist when its dry
remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick
my guitar would probably not be happy without it
its simple basic but i dont think it does that good of a job
this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole
inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge
if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while
the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides
ive never had one of these move from where i left it
air conditioning can do the same
in all actuality its a really simple design
i like this design better because of one simple fact
after the guitar gets hydrated
i usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days
overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother
fits nicely into my acoustic guitars
just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water
luckily i keep that on hand
i bought this guitar humidifier for my taylor
i received exactly what i purchased and works as it should
this product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me
it is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings
i have one of these in every one of my cases
this is good for now
keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking
for the money it works
we all know its just a container with a sponge in it no biggie
but it should do the job
it does what it says it does
i agree with the others reviews
cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster
this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way
it is very safe for guitar finishes
they should have included something that doesnt fall apart
good idea to keep more than one of these around
i play 5string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff
my wife uses on her 6string acoustic and electric guitars
we keep a can in every case
this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks
just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag
it will not dry out and lasts for years
this stuff will lube up your strings pretty well
theres not much to say about this product except that it works
it makes my strings last longer
its small and conveniently stored too
i recommend trying it out
i am in agreement with others that state this is a musthave
i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard
i rub the entire neck down before and after i play
the name says it all
fast fret  fast fingers
this stuff honestly works very well
it is part of my regular arsenal
especially for the price this is a great buy
not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing
take 1015 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor
also its cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you
this is my fifth time buying this stuff
i really like the new container
the tin is way nicer than the old plastic one
this stuff works great and lasts forever
makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier
im really glad i found this stuff
i like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with
this is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player
this product is great i use it after every session
keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board
every guitar player should keep this in their case
this makes sliding on the bass real smooth
its also nice for cleaning
and its super easy to apply
this product is not what it seems
it has a cool name but thats about it
its a tool oil that stinks
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty
seems to work well though i dont know how long its supposed to last
dab fast fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh
first it did not appear that anything was coming out
just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner
but thats exactly what i need to clean and protect my fretboard
the lubricating feature is just a nice plus
i used this on a 5string bass
i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier
my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it
her reason for her opinion is simple
this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hardearned callouses soft
i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string
naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling
my friend hated that part too and i agree with her
soft callouses  no callouses
just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you
ive already posted about fast fret
its a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases
ghs allows me to minimize that
these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads
this has saved my bass drum head from many holes
also has no affect on sound of bass drum
this works and i really like evans
but i got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap
the evans pedal patch will work for you great
it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty
i cheap buy and it works excellent
would the adhesive dry out on this and 2
does it wear over time
the answer is it gets 4 stars
not perfect but pretty god
ive used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar
i think this patch looks cool on the bass
your guitar will be fixed surely
just one thing  that strap is too big for kids
else this is a really good choise
fits straps locks just fine
perfectly happy with this strap
i needed a new strap but i didnt want to pay 20 for one
i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot
its very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap ive ever had
it totally deserves 5 stars
perfect size for us big guys
i do recommend some snap locks for it though
i was displeased with a somewhat poorquality strap i was using before
this is a great bargain too since its certainly not an expensive accessory
the color was a good match for the guitar
put the dough into the guitar not the strap
by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time
for the money this strap is as good as any other poly strap
plus it was made in the usa
no frills just a plain black strap
this is just what it looks like  a very economical strap
the great thing about it is the length
this strap is very long if you need it to be
for the price very hard to beat this
works well withdunlop dual design straplok system blacktoo
overall a good buy for a backup strap or your primary
goes great with my guitar too
for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do
what you see is what you get
its cheap its basic and it works
the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options
i do not need anything fancybecause i am a simle person
it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar
really what more can you say
i wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that
a very attractive and well constructed strap
all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly
this is a great strap
nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible
best part this strap gets long long long
great build quality works like it should
feels comfortable to wear also
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired
at least its long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures
this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length
i wouldnt trust this strap without a strap lock
feels sturdy enough and its adjustable for a man of any size
i like purple and it is purple
i dont have not one bad thing to say
great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap
so sexy with my sg
i was going to get a pink furry one
this is better i think
this is a great strap for the money
this is a very nice guitar strap in light gray
i got this at an awesome price too
product does what you would think
i use it on my bass and havent had a problem with it yet
you cant beat the price
just like every other strap of its kind
i compared it to other poly straps i have and its ok
no better and no worse
it took a long time to come
i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint
im using it as a spare so it should be ok
im used to a higher quality from eb products
it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone
i dont expect any problems
small 34thumbs up34 to amazon
finally i found a long strap for my new guitar
i had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short
it felt like my guitar hung around my neck
this new strap is plenty long enough and looks good
i would recommend this to any guitar player
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily
just try and leave it on always
its cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if youre careful
i plan on using them as backups in the studio
the price was just right cam quickly and id buy them again
and im rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar
if youre looking for an economical strap this will work great
my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products
i bought this one for its adjustability
and it works very nicely with the dunlop dual design straplok system
so perhaps i dont know what shade burgandy really is
or the picture is a bit misleading
the buckle doesnt seem to bother me
i am not calling him or her out or anything
my best guess its playing style
i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother
but for me and the way i play
great strap durable and good lookin
it works great for me i like this type of straps simple  durable
not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap itll do
wish id have gotten something a little nicer though
this is my second sm48 in 25 years
whats the difference between the 58 and the 48
the 48 is made in mexico
there is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the onoff switch
i say go for it
i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast
unbeatable in price and quality
you cant go wrong with a brand name like shure
you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal
as a veteran bluseman i recommend it
as clean as a marsh possum
these mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room
they sound similar to the shure sm58 and we use them every day
they are still going strong
this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned
it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality
it is very clear sounding and very well built
you will not regret it
i like the durability of it and the onoff switch
it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder  adapter
i havent tried this through a pa live yet
i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little
holy guacamole you guys this amp
fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off
i actually got this for my acousticelectric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it
i was very surprised how well built it is
now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic
okay i keep getting off topic here
the sound is clear and crisp for its size
but then my fender doesnt have a pigs snout
there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob
but its much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that
it doesnt have that 34cheap34 feel about it
a word to best describe it
it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet
turn in half way up you get a clean sound
crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous
i own a piece of the legend and music history
loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of naturalsounding distorted tones
fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage
with that baby cranked i spent many happy hours in tone heaven
for the money you cant beat it
just love this little amp
at first thought it was broken but batteries were  not sitting in right
you can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higherwatt amp
it comes with really nice looking stickers
im planning to keep it for years
update on reviewjan 9 2013
ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitars
with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar
i didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good
puts out pretty good power for a little 5w
has a great sound in my opinion
there is one area where the pig prevails
it sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches
as for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree
otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound
my wah wah a morley power wah was almost useless with it
a flanger is also not really advisable
you can use delay just not with very rapid repeats
i just bought a dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggy
using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
it is holding a shure sm57 microphone
i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home
it does the job well
if youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect
many adjustments to get just the right position
ive mounted my samson q1u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it
it works well for sure
then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over
it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room
but atleast for me it does the job and does it well
i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup
its just more accessible on the desk
this would work fine for drummers
i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies
this mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar amps
just got this stand today
first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression
it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap
the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over
the telescope mechanism is quite well made
comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters
i got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall
its quite the perfect height for when im seated on my stool
it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved
maybe adding something to keep it screwed in
probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs
i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk5 drum mic packagefor details
where the stand shines if micing amps
this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height
my use is relatively narrow  kick drums and amps
but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion
everything about it is exactly how you would want it to be
if i need another stand i will buy this one again with no hesitation
this is a well made table top stand
the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease
i would get this stand again
its much better than what i got with my violin
its been good i cant really complain considering its basically tree sap
its ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected
i would recommend going a little higher price
i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply
its so easy to apply and doesnt leave any messy residue on my fingers
this was exactly what i needed
good length but very slippery
for the price why not
i just put this on my dot hollowbody
its a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job
got this for my electric guitar
i am able to adjust it to the length i play with
i love the design and the strap holds up very well
i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol
i hope there had been a closer picture of the product
maybe it will get better looking in the long run
had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong
just a simple well made product that does the job
perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest
a perfect match for the original i replaced
these fit the american sized pots perfectly
the price at amazon was the best i could find without buying used crap
this is an original gibson gear replacement part
besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years
i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats
these look great and work perfectly
i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc
this is a nice part
looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst
these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar
they are even and not warped like the stock ones were
i have used gibson polishes for 38 years
i bought this recently and i love it
if you own a guitar this is the best product out there
but what else can you expect from a us company like gibson
i was very suprised that it was this effective
this little bottle goes a long way
if you need to polish your guitar look no further
this is your best choice
i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar
after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy
it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use
it also comes with a nice polishing cloth
great deal for the money
didnt harm the finish at all
with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get
another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic
overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great
i sent it back probably due to my ignorance
has multiple patterns to collect sound
was a clear mike but i didnt detect any body to the sound
maybe a preamp would have helped
my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close
i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars
now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out
but since i found a good solution i dont think its worth the effort
i cant believe this mic is that good
you wont be disappointed at all
this mic gives a great range of recording purposes
it has impressed me quite a bit since then
for the price this mic is a very good deal
i would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point
got mine for under 130 and its a great mic
ive done a good bit of recording over the years
this mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears
last forever and easy to hold onto
great all round pick one of my favorites
easy to grip and are pretty quite
they wear out extremely fast though
i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin
good for fast strumming etc
they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto
i would buy them again
years ago i used the clayton 34small teardrop34 picks
i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is
its my own fault for not looking at the specifications
been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else
long lasting and great tone besides
ah the folly of youth
first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid
the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the onoff switch
ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal
overall for this price you cant go wrong
seriously this is a great pedal
its run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me
better yet use an ac adapter
i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews
otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years
i take care of my stuff
for your money i cant recommend the eq enough
its cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard
originally i purchased a behringer eq700 equalizer pedal for my rig
this pedal has a cool 1950s style  appearance
for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the 30 price tag
this product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars
i been playing guitar for 12 years now
i play lead and rhythm
a boss eq is solid and all yes but cost alot more
this eq achieves almost the same results and i paid less
it has its own level btw
ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job
for under thirty clams i can look past these things
i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise
the pedal is quiet and solidly built
the price is great too
this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing
for a cheap eq it does great
if it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating
i bought this eq pedal to use with a 70s amp project
the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box
the boost combined with the 2 low bass eqs works wonders for low end
i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me
these danelectro pedals are great quality for the money
the case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy
besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss
ive heard some complaintsworries about the flimsiness of the plastic
as of 0313 the plastic seems pretty thickdurable
its sounding nicer that way
i cant wait to get it through my other amps
ive also heard of very very short battery life
as beginner these strings were not good for me
i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings
i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic
i read the reviews on ernie ball strings
i have to say that i love the strings
they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive
who says ernie ball cant make good acoustic strings
this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon
what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings
very responsive and never dull or weak sounding
crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get 34mudded34 out
i originally purchased these strings because of the 1152 gauges
they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new
arrive on time and as described
pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings
so i reckon each has to find their own
i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars
good brand and good tone
5 stars for this one
id describe the sound as a bit 34metallicish34 definitely a sharper tone
in conclusion i see no reason not to buy and install these again
i have found the perfect strings and these are not them
i will use these for my lower end stuff i will probably sell anyway
we all have our preferences but im not an ernie ball fan
ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life
my playing sucks  sounds better with these strings
bright and warm at the same time
i installed these on a silvertone sd10 which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar
if you are looking for a regularmedium string these are real nice
no mud clear mids and highs with clashing
they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price
for playing they sound pretty good
you get what you pay for
ill be ordering from musicians friend again
im guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel
the sound was much nicer to my ears as well
i have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there
ive used ernie ball fender prs just all kinds
so when i needed more strings i just got fenders
they are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them
these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not
i put these 150s on all of my strats regardless of the brand
they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great
they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect
there are something special about these strings
they ring so bright and beautiful
i absolutely love them for my fenders
theyre gorgeous sounding especially when new
dont know what it is but i love the sound of these strings placebo
maybe but imo these are the best sounding strings ive played with
i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well
i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound
stick to nickel and you will be glad you did
but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks
case in point  pure nickel strings
time was when that was all there was
and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled
especially if you use tubes
tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs
plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips
try a set and see what i mean
its subtle but its beautiful
but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume
than you normally do and give these bargainpriced nickels a try
you might find that youre a convert within seconds
the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels
hell of a bargain at less than five bucks
i like these 942 pure nickel strings
nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners
you cant beat these for the price
sweet action durable and very affordable
decent strings i used for a beat up strat that i had
nothing to special but it was good enough for that
same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory
i have switched to daddarios to capture that frusciante sound
if you play fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings
been buying them ever since and love them
i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges
what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string
they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights
they offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings
would recommend to any level of guitar player
i had changed my strings with some new martins i got recently
luckily id also picked up a package of these ernie ball strings
thank you ernie ball for making far superior strings
my guitar thanks you as well grin
this set of strings is fantastic
when i first started playing i loved the coated strings
i wouldnt buy anything but elixirs for years
i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball
these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought
and the medium light set is just perfect
and at 5 why wouldnt you give them a shot
ive used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d18 for several years
i thought id give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews
they are lighter than i expected
they are closer to light than medium
they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets
i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs
you never know until you try
i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings
the strings seem to hold up well
i dont like the feel or sound of these strings
011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil
put them on my daughters guitar and she enjoys them
anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing
ill take ernies over martins but not over daddarios on my guitars though
ten bucks you cant go wrong
i have owned two of these stands
the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared
it is not the size for mini guitar
may be for the big one
you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low
it leans wayyy too far back
ill be damned if i put my 1000 guitars on these things
do not buy this piece of junk
folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag
thanks to amazon for offering such a good product
i love these little guitar stands
which is good if you are as clumsy as i am
the last two of these that i have owned met untimely deaths
the second one i tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage
but they really are cool little stands and i just bought another one lol
i am a glutton for punishment
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acousticelectric guitars
the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars
this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars
i love its size and portability
for something but not a guitar
it seems to work okay for that
just dont use this for guitars
it may even give you aids
however animals could have been harmed in the making
this is perfect love it
well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around
ideal for gigs as well as studio and home
i needed some little easy and portable guitar stands for the stage
this does it perfectly well
while being light and portable
i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless
the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 34 size ether
not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
i have two of these stands the electric guitarbass version and the acoustic version
great at this price too buy several
this fender mini guitar stand works great
it has cushin padding so my guitar is safe  its small but stady
easy to pack easy on the instrument light weight but sturdy
an excellent value and a great gift idea too
it holds all my acoustics perfectly
its light but stays in place okay
rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like theyll last a while
this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does its job
no scratches or anything on my taylor
this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratchproof stance
not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some
overall well worth the price
small light and stays out of the way  it just works
folds up if needed for travel
so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar
the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too
i am very impressed considering the price
this little stand is great
i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar
not your average giant clumsy guitar stand but it works
if your household is quiet this is very much a good bargain
i have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars
i have 4 classical guitars 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string
its very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over
its a really great quality stand for the price
i guess out of sight out of mind
light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar
folds up and can easily be stored
highly recommend this for the guitar player
and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this 34leaning stuff
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility
easy to put together and holds my guitar very well
the stand works as advertised
i really like the stability of the one i bought
this little guitar stand works very well
this stand folds into a pretty small package but supports the guitar very solidly
maybe thats just a matter of taste but otherwise this is a great stand
this item does the job
this little stand collapses and sets up so easy
may buy one for my dad next
this stand does the trick beautifully
this stand is small but does the job
and folds up in to a small package
it was cheap to buy but works just fine
the arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching
it is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely
perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar
in that case i would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier
i folds down to a very small size but is quite strong
i have a dreadnaught resting on it now ready for use
it should work very well with any size acoustic guitar
my guitar doesnt fall down anymore
looks nice displayed in the corner of my office
very light but sturdy and is portable
the only 34fender34 ill ever be able to afford
this stand feel sturdy and strong
compact design on stand and folding for travel
good for acoustic and electric guitars
thick non scratch foam is a plus
people set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall
good quality and very good sound
these seem a lot more stable than the 1046 i had been using
the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on
like they were made for it
the these strings are fantastic
the sound is deep and heavy which is exactly what i was looking for
makes the bass sound pretty bad
feels great sounds great theres a little bit of magic in these strings
high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound
i can say its built much better than i thought it would be
feels like its built to last
one size doesnt always fit all
it winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter
the design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy
with some acquired technique this tool does a job
fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare
cutter works great winder makes the job really fast
10 minutes it took for all 4 strings
next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing
i wont rant about a string winder
they arent that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter
the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me
so its like that guy who asks for a lighter
its a decent tool at a good price so buy one
then see how long you can own it
this is basically the leatherman multi tool for guitarist
everything you need to know is in the title
for the price this does everything and more
i recommend if you need a winder just buy this
i always keep these around during string changes
each to their own i suppose
this is such a lifesaver or an effort saver
every guitarist should have this
this makes the process so much easier
on top of it all its pretty affordable
but i have no concerns after using it on two string changes
the string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly
overall i am very pleased and saved time on string changes
use it every time i restring my guitar works really good
i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary
no need for a collection of separate tools anymore
this does a fine job of cutting even a thick e bass string
also works to cut ukulele strings
awesome little tool and very impressed with it
im sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me
i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for 6 strings
after using it a couple of times i can only give it high marks
this is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings
it is like the swiss army knife for string winding
it hasnt failed him yet
its easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly
works well for a multitool
and for the price you really cant beat it
3 tools in one handy spot
makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one
arrived quick and before scheduled
everything rolled into one product
winder string cutter and end pin remover
the price is fair for all that
i received it and the first thing i did is try it
it cuts the medal strings like butter
this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster
the cutter worked great too
changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore
cant ask for more than that
i realy like the cutter
the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way
with just a simple screw it comes right off
i much prefer it without the winder
sturdy and a bit weighty
the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up
the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good
you really cant go wrong here
for the price its definitely worth it imho
light weight compact and all in one tool what more could i ask for
the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more
the tool is made of sturdy plastic
the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case
this is a very nice tool
easy to use and makes changing out strings easy
the construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts
perfect for restringing your guitar
very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings
the price was right too
i didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is
ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine
so really i just use this for the wire cutter feature
and the string winder itself also works well
a w e s o m e
the wire cutters also work really well
im glad i bought this product
what more can you ask for
mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use
as for quality it has an unconditional guarantee see above
planet waves aka daddario is a wellknown name in guitar accessories
i have used this winder now 4 times
works a little better at winding strings than the barebones winders
the string cutter is very handy
finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it
the price seems fair enough
get a roadie to do it for you
why have to remember to carry spare batteries
this is exactly what i was hoping for
the string cutter works better than expected
ive only used the string winder so far but it works well so far
i use it on my guitars and my banjo
if not then ill update this review if i can
the cutter even works well
this product is something every guitar owner needs
it is well built performs well and sells at a very reasonable price
the sting cutter works well
so this item is three tools in one
i find it handy useful and i recommend it
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder
but not quiet up to par
terrific allinone musthave tool for guitarists
they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case
buy youll love it and if not you can always return it
it is durable and effective
however all you really need are the two functions and they work
it is a string winder what more can i say
it works as it should and saves time
very useful when restringing a guitar
i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases
cutter winder and pin puller
gets the job done and it is inexpensive
the string winder is a little awkward
if it only came in mink it would be perfect
nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad
im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder
what a great multipurpose guitar tool
the quality is really nice
id be lost without this tool
large enough to fit the fender tuners
this is a pretty cool item
i bought i thought it was cool and different
does what it is suppose to do
what can you say about a tool
if it works properly and it does what more can you say
works great for changing guitar strings
good build and doesnt look cheap
builtin string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus
i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings
it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly
overall i give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter
this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar
it gets the job done easily and very fast
really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot
would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument
it is very solid and will last a long time
really helpful both in live gigs and at home
warning for beginners dont get this
the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast
i hope it goes away with use
the string cutter works like a champ
they dont cut the string they shear it off
ive done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter
nice quality and love the cutter
the winder is a little awkward to use
i guess i need a little practice
but the cutters are great
it actually really surpassed my expectations however
the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiplesized tuners
it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well
the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem
for 7 dollars its a really good deal
bought it to replace strings for my taylor
does all the job that i need it to perform
winds the strings fastpulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wiredoes not scratch my guitar
the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot
can be fixed with some oil
a lil awkward for some
but works perfect for me
like any other tool it doesnt always fit or please everybody
but im a big fan of allinones
the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday
i purchased this before i have ever changed a string
while waiting for it to come  i had to change one
youtube videoed how to do it
but i had wire snips from my jewelry kit available
not everyone would have those
it is sturdy and small
thats what i do anyway
still i think is a good tool to have
cut the strings like they was made of paper
did what it was suppose no need to say anymore
an allinone guitar tool that is a musthave for any guitar case
great quality string winder and cutter
plus it is extremely low priced
yes you really replace your strings very fast with this winder
and it also cuts the strings
it cuts your changing time down drastically
this is a handy little tool
the winder is nice and the clipper works well
and dont be too rough when winding or it will break
i thought it would be resin or plastic
not so  it was made heavier and nicer
the metal musthave will be in the family a while i can tell
this combo string winder peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately
it fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle
not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot
this versatile tool does what it says it does
but after purchasing i realized that a tool like this isnt too necessary
some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks
but it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient
every guitar player should own this tool
this is another useful item from planet waves for the guitar player
guess i am not a gimmick person
very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful
this tool has high marks for one reason  it works
this is the best at combining two tools into one
give it high marks for form and function
the product works perfectly and is durable
it is very hard to accurately cut the strings
makes changing strings a whole lot easier
but thats not a problem any more
but thats not a problem any more
but thats not a problem any more either
after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself
34why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually
with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time
restringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread
overall i like this winder
its handy having the wire cutter built into it
but when i am winding new strings it often slips off
there is a big and a small slot
the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use
the cutter works great you just have to be careful
the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose
sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better
everything i have seems to be jet black
i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out
ive done it successfully for years
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design
my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item
except for that time i couldnt find it
the winder the cutter and the pinpull all work well enough
hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning
that frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff
seems solid and well built
a string winder and cutter
this is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times
i will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly
ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this
the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also
i was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked
its nice having all of the tools on one device
i like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well
its a brilliant idea haha
its very good quality like all planet waves products
saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome
this was the first time ive ever used a string winder and cutter
it make the process of replacing the strings so much faster
the tool works great and is sturdy
if you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand guaranteed
went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle
nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings
thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of five
just changed strings on my epi les paul and this windercutter performed flawlessly
the cutter snips the strings with no effort
huge time saver and works as promised
very glad i bought the  planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter
works perfect for guitar strings
used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo 6
it saves time when restringing a guitar
its made pretty well for a plastic tool
the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine
its not perfect but neither am i so 5 stars would recommend to anyone
i love this guitar string winder
i honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all
and as for the winder
didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing
guess that notch in the peg winder is it
but other wise this thing gets a serious twostar 34meh34
a good piece of kit
except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs
its also squeakily noisy when string winding
it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins
other then that it works just like it says it will
it works well pretty good buy
basically i use this for everything except winding strings
so it costs less because we dont need to use it as much
but then i remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and i thought okay
shouldnt they have a 599 one for 5string bass guitars
will this even work on a 6string bass
after all thats 2 more strings than its intended purpose
these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool
all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonablypriced tool
made by daddario the quality lives up to the brand
its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed
because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5
i note that there are reviews here as old as four years
and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time
others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys
imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity
its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit
some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge
they may wind up damaging their guitar
turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see
and take your time and this device should work fine
the cutter makes this thing really worth while
if i lose it im buying another
this product is straight forward and works as its intended
it doesnt cause any problem with the products performance
i like dunlop products but
the push down applicators dunlops dabomatic applicator tops are horrible idea
one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place
everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well
you wont be let down
dunlop makes good quality products
the fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great
i never realized how dry the wood was
the string cleaner is nice too
i feel like i was neglecting my guitars until i got this
the quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear
the two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable
i would also by the dunlop lemon oil as well
the ultimate guitar cleaning tool i love love love this kit
i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic
this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body
this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course
to keep your guitar looking and sounding great
this is my first foray into that world
but ive used it and its easy
but come on this stuff is just fine
you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase
my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning
i am pleased with this product
probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately
it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths
make your axe shine and look like a rockstar
the products work great applied them to my new les paul ukulele for protection
i ordered this kit to see what it would do
the polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster
the cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument
mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival
that is the reason i did not give this product a 5 star
my bass is not that old but really needed to be cleaned and polished
my fret board looks so good to
i can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red
the other cleaners and polishes are great too
i will definitely purchase this kit again when i run out of the supplies
makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body
this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard
its got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance
everything you need to keep your guitar clean and polished and sexy
the girls will love you and the boys too
take some time but it was well worth it
ive always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards
this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before
a good value box set of quality products
use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape
i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy
got a cleanerpolishwax type ointment for every part of your guitar
comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal
also comes with a step by stepstage by stage instruction pamphlet
worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed
i am pleased with the product
it makes my guitar look new again
i will definitly look into their other products
thanks to amazon for the quick service
i figured id give this a try
i am so glad i did
but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new
big mistake it deadened the sound terrible
i was miserable my guitar sounded like s
im going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars
works a charm on acoustic guitars havent tried it on the electric guitars yet
this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar
my fretboard hasnt been cleanedoiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry
i am very pleased with the product
bought this to use on my 1962 strat reissue
i put new strings on after using this and man
felt just like the day it arrived from the factory
can slide and play much smoother with this
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape
i guess this kit works okay but its hard to use
it will probably last my entire lifetime
i think a smaller kit would have been better
however since i love my guitar i use it anyway
just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it
if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one
has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition
works wellseems to hold up well alsotreatment lasts for awhile
emery cloth for polishing frets is niceworth 2000for sure
this set is not for everyone
in fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set
awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop ab
so for now im good but in a few weeks ill need new strings
in which case ill probably go daddario or cobalts
still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
i use these on an old gibson semihollow body
i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely
tuned them down to a sharp b flat
back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone
i have used ernie ball strings for along time
mostly slinkys or super slinkys
luckily i order two packs
no problems until i got to the g string then pop another breaker
great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too
these are thick strings but still bendable just not very far
i would rate the sound 5 stars
so i have to give these three stars overall
i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty
lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies
so these are heavy strings that work well
tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my sg
i am 66 years old and have been playing guitar for over fifty years
the quality is always the same
also i believe the very best value for the dollar
from extra slinky to heavy gauge jazz strings  you just cant go wrong
these heavy gauge are the main strings i use
i have finally discovered that the 34perfect set34 is a moving target
if your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 469
so i got these and they are awesome
they are not too big or too small
very happy with these strings
if you want great strings get fender strings
they are the best out there
but for metal big strings i stick with ernie ball
i use earnie ball strings as my backup strings
i chose these strings based on reviews i have read on the website
i was definitely not disappointed
this string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body
i have a dot studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly
my son loves them for metal
we will continue to use beefy slinky strings
i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar
i made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress
the final time i tightened them down the high e string broke
since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings
as i said this isnt a knock of these strings
i never really got a chance to play them
just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings
the highest i feel comfortable tuning these to is e flat
i use these on my acoustic washburn and they stay bright for weeks
i have been playing guitar for 30 years and these are the best
great extra light polyweb strings for guitar
really impressed with the polyweb
these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb dont sqeek
my son plays electric and acoustic guitar
he uses elixir for both and swears by them
he has had other brands but they just dont stand up to elixir
what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone
that having been said im pleased with them as a string for guitar practice
they last for months without a change in tone
these strings actually save you money because you dont have to change em much
when they break i change em
there are better sounding strings yes
but if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the tone
the tone isnt bad just not as good as a martin uncoated string
but if you like longevity and less squeak
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
fresh strings do sound better
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
but im not certain these last so much longer
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
june 15 2010 update  elixir is a wonderful company
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
it is so simple and so reproducible
im a huge fan of these strings now
purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings
my son much prefers the elixir strings
this discipline once a habit is good enough
i heard about these from a friend several years back
theres no such thing as a best string
coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years
elixir polywebs were the first coated string
the coating is much heavier than that of other strings
this produces a much less bright more muted sound
the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfect
the 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound
if you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star
im a huge fan of elixirs
these are the best strings you can buy imho
i tried other strings but i always come back to elixir
i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night
i am glad i did
paradoxical i know but thats where the magic of this strap is
like i said the build quality is outstanding
comfortable and easy to adjust for length
padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable
both ends are a loop
you disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods
its easy to uphook one and hook the other
well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts
this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used
the clips look solid and so far they are solid
the strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition
the strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable
i would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap
nope it isnt leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff
amazing strings they last longer feel better on the bends than any other
they have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound
i ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends
by some sort of mixup i got nanowebs by mistake
played for a half hour and retuned sounded better
played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better
played for another few hours and they sound fantastic
and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string ive tryed
these strings are worth it
elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic
they last forever and dont rust
these things last forever for someone who only plays casually
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store
put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string
have 2 problems with the strings
first the bass e 11th string broke while tuning it up
had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not elixir
considering these strings cost much more than others i certainly am disappointed in them
hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good
ive used these elixir strings for years and i would never change
these have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others
these strings are performance value and always give me a great sound
taylor ships this guitar with these strings  and for a good reason
they sound wonderful  right out of the box
i buy elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now
the nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference
these are my favorite strings
they last a long time and my fingers dont hurt when i play
i tried martin strings once and hated them
these are my favorite guitar strings
they are very longlasting and sound great
they are very good strings worth the cost
i am very happy with the elixir brand strings
we will see how long they last
ive used these strings longer than any other strings ive tried about 7 years
they have very little string squeak
can sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars
great for the dedicated guitar player
5 stars arrived on time and in good condition
will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day
you will not want to go back to any other set of strings
ive been using elixir strings for many years
elixir has excellent quality control too
ive never had a problem
lately i have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings
to the less and also most expensive strings
i find the elixir excellent
my testing is ongoing and cannot give the elixir a top rating yet
that may change along the way
however i believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine
what may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone elses palate
my ears remain attentive to future string sounds
i also love the daddario make
which i purchase through amazon
i love love love these strings
super great sound and super long life
ill definitely only buy these from now on
elixir strings are great for me
they hold their tones longer
they arent rough textured so they are easier on the fingers
they also last a long time before they go dead
ive written a review before
never broke a string but i only play at home as a hobby
ill never use another string on acoustics
ive tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated
but come back to these every time
thats not where elixirs kill the competition though
its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength
in fact i typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull
the coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure
for the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life
one nitpicky point of criticism  the packaging is an issue for me
ive got to be missing something here
i would happily buy elixirs in bulk if i had faith in their shelflife
its like playing a silk guitar
it doesnt seem to affect the playability
these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are
they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful
eg low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string
the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking
i like the way they sound
ive heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why
they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier
regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing
protects my string from dna
yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right
in fact its the worst contaminant ever
worse even than the oils and acids on our skin
but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings
its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musicians
ah finally one of the real reviews
look the product may be good or not
it may be the best string ever or not
if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing
a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life
you dont need the hype
i read several reviews before purchasing these strings
time will tell if they last longer than strings 13rd the price
visually they dont appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings
ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not
when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck
i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings
it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory
whats even better is how long they last
im pretty hard on my strings
theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands
the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges
my taylor is much louder now that i use these
these are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer
great great great great great great great great great
been uning them for years
love the sound and playability and durability
matin coated are good too
these strings are very nice and sound great
elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price
to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling
they were buttersmooth and great for flat picking
the clear ring of the martins i normally use
to be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different
ive been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago
i use both electric and acoustic
the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will
every once in a while ill get a 34dead34 string
same thing with strings that break while tuning them up
compared these all in medium
013s on a taylor 210 dreadnought
i tried them back to back
narrowing it down to daddario and elixirs
i did the same with these 3 sets
one day id try all 3 playing along with a cd
then id try a different set every 3 days
the elixir 8020 comes out on top
best sounding of all smooth on my fingers
second elixir phospher bronze last was daddario
id be satisfied with the daddario they do sound good
but the elixir sounds  feels better
i always go with elixirs
i would recommend these to anyone both experienced players and amateurs alike
they last keep in tune and keep their tone
they dont need any string cleaners either
so you can save money on that
enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees
installed as usual and tuned them
they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible
my capo could not even hold them
i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking
i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail
the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now
use at your own risk
i personally wouldnt give a nickel for them
they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing
i get better harmonics with these strings as well
the guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it
i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised
the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them
when i wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth
ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully
so for a player like me these are a godsend
i dont detect any loss of tone
definitely theyre worth a try
these strings have great tone and feel
they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time
if you like this guage youd like these
i just tried them just to try
but ive confirmed i like heavier gauges
my favorite brand of strings right now
8 guitars now are fitted
would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set
i get everything on amazon now
elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment
stretch them bend them and they dont break
i break high e strings on occasion
but something as thick as an a string
further more do i stick with the same brand
that is supposed to last longer than average strings
either way its losing another star
yes these strings are amazing
they really are the better string
they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics
they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics
they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings
been a fan of these for years now
i have been using these strings for the last 7 years
the tone last longer than any other string and they dont break on me
in those 7 years i havent broke a single string
that being said i dont play heavy at all
i will buy these strings until the day i die
especially the acoustic version of these
their tone is great and the nanowebs feel nice when youre playing
disclaimer i would only recommend the nanoweb not the polyweb
always the best string i buy
i like the martin coated as well but i prefer the elixer
for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start
then i happened across these elixir nanowebs
however i did encounter one strange thing
i was surprised because outwardly the string didnt look that bad
so that is the downside
with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking
made me a little cautious
i still prefer these 100 over other strings though
i would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars
these are the best strings ever
they sound great and last forever
they will sound great for the life of the string
normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long
to me they didnt feel right
with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever
the only string ill use
pricey as far as strings go
elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my guitars
they are smooth and bending is a breeze
they last longer than most other brands ive used
i use a little finger grease spray and i would recommend them to anyone
played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now
dropped the action back down and its smooth as silk in an hours time
the title says it all
theyre elixirs you just cant go wrong with elixirs
trust me ive played for 13 years
great sound and no wear after one session unlike the daddario strings
i will update in a few weeks as i see how long they last
good strings for my electric guitar
i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more
bought these for my sons electric guitar
they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands
elixir strings are very nice
so slick and last forever compared to standard strings
some people say they are too slick
but you will get over that once you see how long they last
been using these for years
they cost a little more than other strings but theyre worth it
outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time
id pay double for these strings all day
these guitar strings are very nice and i love them
i always buy this brand
they work well and sound amazing
instead i got a decent set of
10s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup
so i must say im summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings
whats the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast
especially when it costs three times more
and whats up with the tuning thing
and why do these cost so much more anyhow
is a microthin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string
not when that string is toast in 50 minutes zero doubt there
so much for magic elixir tone
or heck even just a little better
i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions
after four more hours the a string went
an hour later guess what
so thats four broken strings in less than 20 hours play
in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money
but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all
these are my favorite brand of strings
that bright sound can last about 6 months or more
sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried
i usually only have to change my strings once a month
they rock and i feel they are the best strings around today period
ive been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now
these tend to last me about 3 months
so i am very happy with them
they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there
all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great
a great product no matter what gauge string you choose
the a string too doesnt project as much as the standard strings
i have written other reviews about elixir
great for acoustic and electric
no complaints on these strings
but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it
acoustic and elixir electric strings as well
i bought my first pack over 7 years ago and ive been hooked
these make my cheap 50 acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my martin
they sound great on my martin too
i have used these strings for years and this was a great price
purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my sons acoustic guitar
he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings
he says they last a lot longer and sound better too
they sound great and hold their tone for a long time
no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind
i have been using these strings for 7 years
at first i used the elixir polywebs but those things broke all the time
i switched to these and havent broke a string since
elixir is my favorite brand of strings
by far the best acoustic strings period
they sound great and last forever
what can i say i am a string snob
the guitar has such a great ring to it
also use these on my taylors
these will give any quitar a beautiful voice
i have tried many types of steel strings
they are great strings on any guitar
changing strings on a 12 string less often
and the sound is good
i didnt expect this much volume from light strings
endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer
you can not go go with a set or two of elixers
these strings are great for a 12 string
and i think they will last longer
which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring
im not a pro by any means
i am enjoying this guitar
it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range
it may tend to overdrive a little bit
more than my other guitars again not a pro
a drop of wood glue fixed it
its pretty enough and fine for a 100 guitar
but i really wanted 34natural wood34 and it isnt
otherwise it would be a 5 star
i play it every day
this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful
being from tampa i wanted my first guitar to be a dean
well i must say i am very happy with the purchase
as others have noted the finish can vary drastically
overall looks a nice piece especially for the cost
i could not ask for better for this price
overall nice looking feeling guitar for a beginner
feels and looks good right out of the box
can be upgraded in time if you choose
cons tuners may or may not slip when playing hard
finish is variable be willing to accept whatever shade you get
fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue
its a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup
hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point
this takes the guess work out of tuning your hides
its also easy to use
it can be confusing during the first time i used it
but it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum
very handy and gets the job done quickly
it works but ill probably end up getting a better one
if you understand what this is for i think its a great idea
keeping in mind im a guitar player who just bought a drum kit
now whatever number im on is the reference number for that drum
also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth
these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work
how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated
i purchased this key on a whim
too loose and deep so i increased the setting to 3 and repeated
i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest
ill never go back to tuning by ear
this is my second 4 way switch and it wont be the last
i am very pleased with the 34new sound34 of my tele
dont forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder
this switch does work but you should look before you leap
recently i was building a telecaster project
this is clearly a case of 34your mileage may vary
34  ive been used to the traditional 3position switch on my other telecasters
im a bit indifferent to this mod
if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again
however i would not change out a working 3way switch for this
for me the added benefit just isnt worth the effort
i figured it would go the same way as the threeway  wrong
just another example of the incompetence at fender
i got these for a partstele i built and im really happy with them
but they look great work great stay in tune and are completely vintage spec
i have a 57 reissue strat and i cant tell the difference
these are niceand this was easily the best price around
but i was annoyed that they  the bushings didnt fit the standardvintagesized
340 holes in my allparts neck  theyre a little large
so be aware of that
looks good but disappointed that they arent made in the usa
oh well just shows me little by little more and more things arent anymore
first of all dont expect any new tuner to work as a dropin replacement
these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look
they would look great on a either a strat or tele
1 star off for not looking like the higest quality
im happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier
tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides
i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware
going to upgrade electronics and everything else too
they work perfect and look good
you get 2 in package with screws so i have a spare
these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guidetree
installed on a tele i built
much less surface of the string touching
very smooth action when using the vibrato
took no more than 10 minutes to install
i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar
these look like rollers but are not rollers
guitar tuned easy and holds tune well
not a drop in replacment for many fenders
that happens far less now
definitely recommend these over any other string trees
im using the guides to replace factory guides on my strat and tele
they will require that i drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly
i hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done
the quality of these guides is not what i expected
they are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them
at this point im not even sure that i will use them
meh these things are what they are
they didnt solve any problems or make anything better
oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason
honestly they dont need to be at least for most guitars
a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps
an inexpensive mode that looks and works great
i had a hard time lineing them up to install
the little knob on them made it very hard to install
these work much better than standard stamped trees
no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly
good trees for the price
these are good replacements or upgrades
work much better then the other style of string trees
just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts
i put this in my fender mim stratocaster
mounted and this looks like a solid product
i was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes
i just looked at pics on the net and got them close
the lil suckers are all about tuning  stability
pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily
fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway
its inexpensive and does what its supposed to
just buy it and move on
i like the dunlop design and price
it should last a lifetime
the black dunlop has a nice smooth finish
this capo is one of the best made ive seen
downside seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive
come on capos dont have 34tone
34  just get one that doesnt get in your way
also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys
thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia
worked perfectly for that purpose
did not hold the strings down very well for me
i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power
i was impressed by the quality of this product
it is simple and does its job well
holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise
i love these dunlop capos
i bought 5 of them from amazon because they were such a good price
wasnt expecting much for this price
have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems
i also have a more expensive capo just like this one
they look as though they come from the same factory
more expensive is not always better
great stuff to have for a great price8230i like it
highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar
i use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars
other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily
i have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes
this works very well for all of them
for the price i have no complaints at all
this capo is inexpensive and works well
clips on easily and hold strings down nicely
what more can i say
gotta keep it simple on this review because its a simple item
simply it does what its supposed to do for a low price
you should have one of these in each gig bag
i purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar
that did not last long
i ordered this one and he loves it
its durable and works perfectly
i havent used it a lot yet but i really like it so far
id assume it was made out of castiron or something instead of aluminum
good item for the price
this is a fine product
any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it
looks great on the guitar and works really well
what works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another
fits great easy onoff easy adjustments
all relevant areas of the capo are well padded
this product does what you want and is easy to take on and off
definitely a great value for the money
i thought id try something else out and settled on this one
its easy to take on and off
i dont know about a 7 or 8 string though
liked this capo it worked fine
this capo is small looks good and works very well
it is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar
ive used the classic kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars
thats my experience at least
highly recommended for acoustic guitar players
its nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play
a lot of songs say capo preferred
i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo
it works good and that is all i need
the fit and finish seems like quality also
ive had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos
anyway this capo works well
im sure there are better ones but for me this works well
i think its a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly
simple to use works well on the squier strat
i was not a fan of this particular capo
it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style
sturdy welldesigned and frets the strings well
the back clamps firmly to the guitar without maring the finish
simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors
as capos go this gets the job done at a good price
doesnt seem to put undue pressure on the guitar
i have two of these
this capo design works best for me
tension is perfect for my washburns
one has light strings  the other has medium
both of them sound like there was no capo on
overall im happy with this brand
i have a electric bass guitar and needed to capo
after looking at 34reviews34 i like this one the best
im very happy with it and it works great without any problems
the size is 34just right34 not too small or big
nice cushion on both sides  onstring and the back of the arm
stays very firm on the arm
itll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing
its not cheap and flimsy though
i dont see this one wearing down anytime soon
now stop reading this review and buy this capo
im truly surprised by all the good reviews here
im not sure how its possible
i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar
both capos had this very same problem
when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me
this capo is solid and well made
i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster
just squeeze and slide it where you need it
available in several finishes to match your taste
its nice and easy to use
does what it is supposed to do
it is pretty good quality and durable too
i would definitely buy again
that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy onoff
this is the first quickchange capo ive owned
i used to use those old stretchy things
move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune
the spring is tough and it holds securely
but i like it so far
ill update after ive had it for awhile
thought id try this but theres another brand that i prefer
i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best
it is cost effective and looks good
this capo cannot work with it
if i lost it i would definitely get another just like it
it feels well constructed like it wont break if i drop it
the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings
ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitars neck
item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging
part number  83cb made in usa
i come back to purchase another
if youre looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model
but for a small woman with small hands its difficult to operate
when playing at home ill use the more gentle schubb
it works great and looks better
though my playing still isnt very strong  the capo still is
this acessorie is well builded and dont change the guitars pitch
grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard
white thin picks by fender what else can i say
ive always been a fan of these fender classic picks
i also think the price is pretty fair
they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome
what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect
if you havent used these picks get some
they are the perfect size and shape
your really cant beat them
i prefer no cheap imitations
i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick
seen these and they work great when needed
i have used fender medium picks since the late 60s
yes they are made in china now
but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell
all 12 were in there all of them fender mediums
the picks are great and i couldnt be happier with the order
recommended if you wantneed a nice little bag of fender mediums
this is my guitar pick of choice
i  fits well in my hand and is well balanced
have tons of picks  but seem to use this one all the time
no fancy expensive flashy grip features
guitar pics as the gods of rock intended
the fender medium is my second choice for picks
pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion
fender medium my favorite guitar pick a dozen should last a while right
when these slip away ill order more
sure enough the lining is soft and wellpadded
the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect
it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price
i bought this case for my rogue astyle electric mandolin
the inside is nicely lined the hardware is solid
it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap
i recommend this to anyone with an astyle mandolin
it is a mandolin case
plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck
and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces
this case will definitely do the trick
but again for simple storageprotection its a nonissue
i like the big size type
would like to have a thinner one
having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks
i use all types and all brands and fenders are always predictably great quality
this shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick
the stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string
good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead
as a beginner these make much more comfortable
purchased a pack for my playing buddy
will order another set soon
the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package
all 12 picks were there
saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car
they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings
good deal and i will purchase again
next time ill go for a vibrant color
at the time i figured all picks were created equal
since then ive tried various sizes and brands  dunlop planet waves etc
the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly
the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddysounding
ive found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more
they arrived well packaged and not loose
not too thicknot too thin
you will not be disappointed
ordered these guitar picks for my son
the picks were exactly as described
it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy
he is very pleased with these picks
we will be purchasing more picks in the future
i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks
these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are
very nice quality and very cool color to them
they are also priced very good
recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar
additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door
three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step
these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well
overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone
fender makes a nice standard pick
the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy
these mediums work well for playing electric guitar
i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex
those work well for acoustic
they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick
the gray dunlops dont look anywhere near as cool as these
at 3 for a dozen theyre worth a try
dava 6024 grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey
these are the classiest nicest looking picks i own
they look great feel great and play great
call me a snob but i wanted these to match my fender stratocaster
kind of like using a gm part on my 68 chevelle
easier to strum sounds good to me
i bought these as spares and they look really cool too
i think everyone has used fender mediums at some point these are no different
reliable last a while and more important theyre inexpensive
perfect perfect size weight shape
i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning
4 for these 12 beautiful premium quality picks is a steal
hey i got this and an ovation idea from godps
i couldnt be happier with these items especially the ovation idea
do you even remember why you picked the style you use
somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain
i like the sound and feel of these picks
they add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk
i bought the abalone ones because they look cool
i have since gone back to delrin and nylon
medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people
i wouldnt buy anything else
everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing packageing and shipping
my friend left a thin pick and i tried it
since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice
the pick had a little more give so i dropped them less
ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it
the tip is a little more rounded
so its back to the fenders
the contrast helps you see what your doing
i dont drop em anymore
personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass
the med is pretty stiff
im a little surprised at this one
i like fender mediums because i use them on both bass and guitar
clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone
great customer service and love the pics
the color in the pictures doesnt do it justice
7mm and thats just right
very pretty and nice quality
they are not too stiff nor are they too soft
i would order these again
its a fender heavy so theres not much else to say about that
good price and selection here
i have used coins and washers at times
i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best
fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them
price them at a store and you will come back here
these didnt show up so i contacted amz which goes back to godps
it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks
lasts a good long while
terrific trippy pearl tones and azures
also my pitch harmonics better known as squealies come out clearer to me
so i got my full order
they feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard
i am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes
these are by far my favorite picks
the feedback is good and theyre stiff enough to strike clear tones
a guitar player can never have enough of these things around
what else can i say
hardly any breaks considering i get the thin ones
i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies
these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well
i needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic
i find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber
these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well
i got a half dozen for christmas and was thrilled
fender 351 picks are some of the best picks money can buy
i have used these picks for years now and i just love them
i needed picks so i ordered an assortment
i have been trying different ones
i seem to like them all
i wanted to experiment with a thin pick
might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers
celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i dont
however the price was good
i love being able to adjust the tension
does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down
just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar
i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating
the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable
this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings
the c1 is probably the most universal of all the models
the primary use is for a laguna acoustic
follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension
its key to not get too much tension
weve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo
mostly it goes in a pocket
not a huge deal but a consideration
this is the best capo ive ever owned
i like the choice of colors too
they dont squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool
researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the shubb
easily the best quality capo for its price
looks great on any guitar
ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day
i didnt even have to adjust it
it looks amazing in use
and is just the best and simplest design
dont forget to remove it when you guitar is resting
its easy to forget its there
forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos
this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised
i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine
looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well
i feel that its a good deal and  recommend it
i love this guitar strap button
its a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in
i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink
it works well for its stated purpose and appears to be of high quality
quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather
even so it was a good quality button
the leather is tough and will last for years
it will probably outlast the guitar
maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit
but its really worth the hassle
plenty of cord to move around with
just what the guitar doctor ordered
i love this cable they look good and are well made too
so good that i bought another one
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
i just learned last night how to coil them up
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
but no harm done still works great
none has ever failed me so far
i love how they sound and they are built well
they just rob your tone
these are the best cables for the money
what else could you ask for
the answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking for
the cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew
the jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime
so the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight grayblack
for me i like the heft of these cables
constructionwise these are likely lifetime cables
check out the pictures ive posted
the metal housing screws into the jack
there is an oring to seal the top portion of the threads
i dont think the actual 14 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks
they are clear clean cables
are they better than the 100s
oh maybe a tiny bit
maybe a little clearer cleaner sound
but it isnt a huge difference
bottom line for gigging probably go with the 100s
for practice or in your house these are probably the way to go
they do look particularly good plugged into a marshall half stack
these cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else monster cable
these cables work very well at transmitting sound
so why only three stars
these are stiff thick and heavy
i mean lets face it
you never know what will happen at a gig
lastly these plugs are huge
so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables
these cables are just poorly thought out
i did not know that these cables actually made a difference
it was a pleasant surprise
i also heard about the wonderful warranty that monster has
i did a little experiment
the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable
im buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables
none has ever failed me so far
its hard to beat the quality of monster cables
i compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own
i got 4 replacememts over 3 years
worth the higher price because of the warranty
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
im not really a corksniffer re  guitar tone
i think this monster cable sounds fine
i dont really notice a difference when i use different cables
i look for guitar cables that will last
oh and the return process
this was maybe 10 years ago
about 2 weeks later i had a new cable
i consider that to be excellent customer service
so i tried this monster cable
my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff
i would still recommend it though
this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones
the plugs are of excellent quality also
the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable
i urge you to purchase if you are looking
btw i am a verified purchaser just cant say enough good about this cable
monster cable is one of the things on earth we can count on
i shouldve just got this cable the first time
i have been using monster for years
i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way
heavy duty and rugged it should last forever
thinking about buying another one
the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent
i really love monster cables
the monster chord is great looking but for me they are too stiff
i play an acoustic guitar so i dont run around a lot
it is a great option if not simply the best
monster knows it all in quality
these cables are sturdy and sound clean
using cheaply made cables could affect your sound  you can loose top end
quality is there in construction and signal passing
we never have problems with our monster gold cables
conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically
these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut
but this is a case of you get what you pay for
for me thia is the best cables ever
hands down the best cables for electric guitar
these are not only the best in delivering tone but theyre durable
i bought some planetwaves cables for 40 that didnt even last me 2 years
i would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only
this is a very heavy guage
to me the warranty is worth it because of the price
this is definitely a high quality cable
sonically i found them to be the same  or to my ears anyway
same manufacturer but different models
should be able to stand up to any use or abuse
ive had mine for over a year now
and it has worked flawlessly
no problems with distortion or noise
build quality is as solid as they come
nice gold tips and polished finish for great connectivity
like the title says the timeless combo of neutrik  mogami is better
if youre wondering how to get neutrikmogami cables cheap make them yourself
it saves you so much money
it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure
the plastic is pretty lightweight but it is a big help
i keep various guitar picks clips pencils etc
i am using it with a musicians gear music stand
it is a good thing it does not cost a lot
a must have five star item
piece of plastic with no bracing
i used doublesided sticky tape  problem solved
this acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever
it has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well
i couldnt be happier with the purchase
it fits very well and sounds great
could not get to fit small sound hole
once in sound hole pickup did not work at all
through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear
i bought this for my 1974 martin d18 for recording on my pc
so far it is working great
i got too much background noise with the mike
i turned that light off and the buzz went away
im glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup
its not a big deal
how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable
anyway the pickup sounds very nice and im happy
this is an excellentsounding pickup
ive had it for about six years
at the price it sells for i consider it a bargain
no metallic hiss youd normally expect
it takes some skill to eq things to the point of normalcy
if youre uncomfortable dealing with eq this might not be your best bet
otherwise a wonderful product at a great price
im impressed with these exp16 guitar strings
what i expecteda more dead sound than the noncoated strings they replaced
coated strings usually lack the bright highend brilliance that uncoated light strings have
what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound
these deliver on both counts
durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes
so far they are holding their tone and brightness
i will report back after three months
conclusioni will be ordering more of these
i think they perform very well for the price
love the bright light gauge sound and playability
ive always found daddario quality to be great
but unless you are new to guitar you know that
these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer
really i cant tell that they do
they sound great and play great and i usually purchase daddario or martin strings
change the strings every couple of months
im giving 5 stars because daddario makes great strings
this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank
i have made them last up to 2 months
they are the right length and go on easy enough
these strings sound great with great dynamics on them
darn near as near to an uncoated string that youre going to find
elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar
these are very nice bright strings
the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings
compared to elixirs these are a bit brighter with good feel
call me old school i hate the packaging
these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag
ah you know im just so used to strings that are individually looped
the neat freak in me hates that
i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag
yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible
but darn it 6 paper envelopes
100 postconsumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load
i know daddario loves the color coded ends
on my electric guitars i dont like the look at all
i prefer gold or silver rings at the end
if the strings are in individual labeled packages theres no need for the colors
i have yet to decode their colors or naming system
i normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar
i tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much i like them
the slightly thicker string is not bad
oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixirs
i think they are worth the premium price
now there are two choices for excellent coated strings
what they sound like and play like is the most important thing
and in that regard these are excellent strings
easy on my fingers too
i am an acoustic guitar addict
i think its time to sell them off
these exp16s are superior to them all
i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong
these daddarios do both things and do them well
not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string
as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable
the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life
so are these any good
these light strings go from
053 as compared to my old martins which went from 0012 to 0054
in summary daddario makes good strings and these are no exception
daddario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time
i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar
the other quality thats noticeable is sustain
the response of the exps sounds very consistent to my ears
ive had them on for a couple of weeks now playing fairly regularly
inbetween the lights and mediums
you get the bright booming sound
nice bends and of course the longer playing life
to brigthen the sound a tad
these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive
the tone is clear and bright
personally i just love the daddario strings
they sute my needs just right for the takamine acoustic
uncoated strings last me about a month
its a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle
not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze
not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze
the exps are nice strings
they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise
i figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze
only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer
i prefer the warmer tone
i tried it and the quality is low end
the sound is not as crisp
id go back to elixir next time
these are fairly pricey but i am very impressed with the quality
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars
easily stretched and tuned with no problems
you can not go wrong with daddario strings
daddario guitar strings are favourite strings
i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also
you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often
you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned
there are two ways guitar strings go bad
this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound
coated strings are a simpler alternative
the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings
they also cost about twice as much as equivalent noncoated daddarios
if youre an active performer maybe
youre probably also buying your strings by the box
theres no real benefit to these strings
these strings are the bomb
i have used daddarios since my earliest playing days
since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try
i am glad i did the tone is great
exps make my guitar sound like it should
individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth
they blend together beautifully when paying chords
daddario exp16s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used
they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking
for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once
especially if you like to save your single strings for use
im glad i tried out these daddario strings
i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone
the exp16s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic
this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallowbodied ovation
other than that the strings are just a little squeaky
i bought these for my little sister and she loves them
they have a really nice sound to them
ive long been partial to daddario stringsi dont have a guitar without them
these phosphor bronze models have found a home on my epiphone flattop
they project without sounding harsh or tinny
playing feel is fairly smooth for roundwound strings and they last for ages
guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string
my loyalty is certainly not shaken
good bargain though for 699
sounds all right to me bright and well balanced sound
i like daddario strings but these did not impress me
they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion
ive been playing guitar for more than 20 years
ive played 6 strings 12 strings bass acoustics and electrics
still other strings have a rich full resonance that carries through a room
this is the only string ive ever used that has all of those qualities
i use the  exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads
i love the sustained bright tone
they work well with my cedar top guitar
easy on the fingers too
ive used many brand for my guitars for years
this one is very good long lasting guitar strings
easy to install and use and very reasonable price
thanks amazon for this product sale
not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about
ghs strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these
i dont notice much difference at all though
one doesnt get much better than daddario strings
i certainly recommend daddario nylon strings on classical guitars
but always come back to this one
different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use
okay mine has just arrived
so first of all i want to say packaging is great
the sound is so warm and bright
i have a nanoweb before and so far the exp16 is better
i will stay on with the exp16 right now
i did not care for the tone or feel
took them off within an hour and put back on ej16
they had a rough feel and were stiff
lots of folks like them but not for me
i bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips
the price was very good
best i could find for this time of hard case
if you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well
i do not know if it will fit other guitars
i have heard that some are too long for it
for the fender stat it works just great
i ordered this for my jackson dkmg
this is my 1st gator case and im very pleased with it
it is similar to skb and fits my guitar very nicely
i will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it
just remember that this model is for standard type axes strats teles and such
are hard to beat when it comes to durability
this is the best case ever for the money
i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week
the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesnt move at all
my buddy likes the case so i am happy
nothing gets 5 stars  there are no generals present
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
both ended up in checked luggage
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
these stands are just what i wanted for my studio
i like them so much that i own five
im very happy with the solid build
works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster
sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars
this low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked
i just dont like the features of this stand at all
i read the reviews of the few similar options
not much of that complaint here
but this definitely has that problem
so this cant go in several outoftheway places i had hoped would work
however the angle makes that very awkward
will probably have to manufacture something to replace it
these stands are truly amazing
well built and solid stand
it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too
it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars
this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size
i like onstage and own several of their products
kinda sucks that its not level out of the box so 4 stars
very sturdy stand suitable for stage use
this stand even accommodates a double neck
its not very compact when folded but im still giving it 5 stars
very well made of heavy metal framework
has a very solid base
the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar
have had one for years
i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar
super stable and doesnt take up much space
for the price i dont think it can be beat
this does what you expect it stands up a guitar
what can else can be said
it has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents
it is portable folds up easily for storage
i usually have a guitar on it all the time
ive bought 4 of these over the past couple of years
totally perfect for holding my guitar
super sturdy easy to put intake out
the stand can be used with or without the upper brace
also the 34feet34 dont spread as wide apart as id hoped
a few more inches would have been appreciated
all in all a good but not 34perfect34 stand
ive used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting
this one is the worst
secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp
after twisting on it twice i stripped it out
now the thing is worthless
do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6 pop filter
if you dont youll wish you did
not easy to set up hard to tighten down
works well enough as a filter once you get it placed
its a good product works well and does what its meant to do
as for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generoussized screws etc
i know ill never be able to blow it away
you may wat to reconsider buying any filter
despite this the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good
in all honesty buy a nicer filter or none at all
if this is the case spend the money to get a nicer filter
i found that quality nice when dealing with
not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic
pivots in 1 direction only
should last a few months at least
i got this for my wireless mics but they dont fit in this holder
i got the wrong size holder
not happy with the sellers description or the product
who uses flexible mic clips
make sure you dont buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead
its poorly made with attention to detail
i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon
but they will not screw down all the way and are losse
other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine
what do you expect for two dollars
i use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics
you cant go wrong here
ive been buying gear from alto music since 1980
i was purchasing from my local music store through amazon
for me the mic has been all its cracked up to be
one for bass rolloff and one for midrange emphasis  presence boost
of the lot the shure sm7b is my favorite of the ones still available
the sm7 was a redesign of the sm5
todays sm7b is the best noncondenser vocal microphone still in production
stop looking and buy one
it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the evs
the heil pr40 is pretty good but doesnt have any onboard eq options
the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work
with the sm7b you dont have to
if you want a good all around microphone this is not it
if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is
most real studio preamps are a good match for it
ive plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too
you need at least 60 db of gain the spec sheet actually says 59
70 db would be better
45 db isnt much at all for any decent mic preamp
they all need an external windscreen but only the sm7b comes with one
i got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens
it has a nice metal case for storagetravel
the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged
they are also very durable for foam screens
you can just leave the plate off if you want
this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic
i still am an sm7b guy
and just switched the mics out
what you need to know about this mic 1 this mic is very directional
i found that a palms width from the tip of the mic works best
aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal
right at the upper lip works well for me
2 the bass cut and presence boost are convenient
though it takes eq well and you can eq that in
it rejects whats behind and to the side but in front its pretty sensitive
hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and youre set
5 so what does it sound like
the sound is very natural and true to my voice
it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost
that plus the dryupclose characteristic are this mics top selling points
it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparseacousticclean backgrounds
thats one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals
it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic
6 this thing is heavy and rugged
the capsule is surrounded by this truncated conelike metal screen enclosed on all sides
the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors
make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60db of clean gain
some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to 35db
but since my room isnt perfect this will do
this is a problem because the sm7bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches
seriously a 2db shelf in the highs
works great if used correctly
it can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion
it just sounds more organic and less sterile than the boss pedal
use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp
the dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive
a must for pedal boards
both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal
the pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also
would i buy this yes if i didnt try anything else first
this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it
you could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra
i would buy more if i needed them
durable yet lightweight and sturdy
and the price is right
pacific hardware is excellent right up there with tama
i would buy this again
decent stand as long as you arent abusing it
i dont plan on moving it so it works for me
nice padded seat well constructed
good padding for comfort i go 190lbs
heavy duty base lots of adjustment if needed
love amazon why shop anywhere else
in this case you can look forward to getting a great product here
the stool is very sturdy no rocking no swaying no moving at all
worth the money great product
the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should
theres not much to say except that it get the job done very well
this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne
the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone
you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders
in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful
if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss
eq is to enhance your tone not create it
a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa
your tone is made up of many many variables
the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies
that is the function of an eq nothing more
it can range from dramatic to very subtle
very small changes can have large effects
nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq
ten bands is a little overkill for guitar
as another guy said 34how could i live without this pedal before
simply outstanding simply the best
still needed a nice touch
this guy filled the need
this thing controls your tone so well
each band is hyper sensitive
five for tone highmidlow and five for gain
this is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus but distinctly noticeable regardless
by far the most versatile pedal i have ever used
i cant imagine not using it now that i have it
but it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase
just ups the value even further
i really cant recommend this highly enough
i think every guitarist and bass player should own one
this is an always on pedal for me
its at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe
a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin
they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required
but you must be careful
not remos fault but it is something to pay attention to
i bought it for my church and the drum sounds great
i love the quality and the sound
buyer beware for this kind of
you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed
all joking aside these heads really are great
this seemed perfect and it is
regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book
anyway  no reservations about this one
a deadsimple idea that works great
the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position
i would purchase this unit again and again
it is a good piece and a good deal
this is a tough unit easy to set and locks tight
this fit the bill perfectly
this is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture
the pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust
but there is no counterweight here so its best used at shallow angles
its solidly built and i dont imagine it will break easily
long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate
it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin
i will be buying more of these
im quite happy with any of the on stage brand stuff i have
i use is this mount to support a samson meteor mic
i would definitely buy this again
the mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand
it has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
again it works perfectly for my situations
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality
a very nice addition to my collection
im used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck
occassionally there are problems with this set up
no more bendable problems i really love these extensions
ive had good success with this piece
i put a heil fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax
my only small 34concern34 is the length of the arm itself
havent had this long but so far its just about perfect
im convinced even heavier loads will be no problem
if youre in need of a side boom look no further
sturdy flexible and well designed
lots of metal where there needs to be metal
buy a few youll be glad you did
my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit
if looking for that oriental sound this is it
some folks expect something different i suspect
think it sounds like a trash can lid
want a really good china
small diameter gives it a shrill overtone
poor on recordings unless youre looking for that
anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad
or go buy a k kustum and quit your sniveling
any size wuhan china sounds great
this little 12inch model is highpitched but has that trashy wuhan sound
i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china
and at the asking price who can resist
really packs a punch haha
i got this china and was blown away by it
what can i say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal
you cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal
placed it on top of my 18 crash and it looks great
we live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals
one could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals
there are a lot of really expensive distortionod pedals out there
having two tone controls makes all the difference
this pedal is tubescreameresque but not as midrangeheavy as a ts
anyway this thing sounds great
excellent classic rock and lead tones
the things it wont do  1 a clean boost
2  it wont clean up when you turn your guitar down
or at least not much
i have a barber ltd which does that beautifully
but despite those limitations the bad monkey is awesome
this is a very good ts type pedal at a great price
the ability to adjust treb and bass is nice
this is an analog pedal an the only digitech pedal ive ever contemplated keeping
if you dont have a ts type pedal this is a good cheap choice
as i indicated i have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol
ive had this pedal for about five years
the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons
first is the bass and treble controls
second is the mixer out
its built like a tank
cant go wrong for the price imo
this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal
if youre a metal or hard rock player dont buy this
for that its excellent especially considering its very low price
and despite its very low price its very solidly built
i have no idea how itll sound with a solid state amp
but it sounds great with a tube amp
it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville 410fender mustang floorboard combination
as ive said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing
this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is
its just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph
youve got to get this pedal
i prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that
it also is a nice smooth od not too crunchy
for a cheap 808 clone this is the best i have used hands down
this pedal makes my les paul sing
better than i imagined even with all the good reviews
makes my crappy behringer amp sound
the overdrive is quite good
for the price i dont see how you can beat this pedal
i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome
no complaints with this outfit
more knobs are not always better
notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock
but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the twoband eq
if its too muddy you can add treble
it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal youll need
this pedal is beyond loud
the bm might work better with solid state
the bad monkey overdrive pedal does not produce crazy train metal distortion
it seems extremely rugged again like boss pedals
it works well with both single and doublecoil pickups
if i lost my pedal i would order another right away
ive also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better
ive tried to like this pedal i really have
maybe its my signal chain
sure the od is there but it isnt worth losing your tone is it
again i reiterate maybe its just me
i have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now
and the blue pedal isnt any different either imo
grunge was ok but not my kind of style
theyre also awesome for live recording use as a monitor
i will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable
they are certainly worth the price
price very reasonable price for what they do
noise reduction these are absolutely stellar at noise reduction
they also dont distort out side sound
some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly
sound quality crisp mid and high range
when it comes to the low end these are lacking
and if you blast your music the low end distorts
but they block sound so well you dont have to blast them
why not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffs
it is very annoying doesnt work very well and looks pretty dumb too
these head phones are a much better solution
i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc
they work well for that
the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head
after a time the pinch is bit much
i have a small 714 hat size too
however the price was great and the sound is good
one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use
i still use both brands
please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones
meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units
carefully adjusted to add littleno volume to the signal path unity gain
the resulting sound is absolutely topdrawer and completely belies the incredibly low price
i paid for the entire system
affordable technology in the service of great art
update 232009  these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time
i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones
the newest pair live in my gym bag
the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does
leaving me with the same music and way less background noise
soothing music is part of the fix
ive tried and replaced several
but they either sound badly are prone to electricalmechanical problems or both
vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers
i own and use them both
the direct sound phones block a bit more noise
the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing
both have excellent sound quality
these do a good job of isolating out the sound
these things muffle sound great
they have good sound quality
perfect for recording loud drums
nice feel to it and seems sturdy
great accessary for yamaha keyboards
very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out
its great to have sustain again on my keyboard again
well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio
this pedal works with the yamaha motif that was my main concern when ordering
a backward sustain pedal is not fun
so  build quality excellent
there are usually two wires of differing color
2 the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged
i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment
this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools
hopefully this helps some who have posted questions
does what it should and yamaha quality
the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal
i am using on a yamaha board
my first guitar ever i am happy with it
i read great reviews here and the price seemed good
it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned
and the top part isnt pink like the pic also as others have mentioned
and i like those strings better
i also ordered dava 6024 grip tip guitar picks they are nice
and i got a kyser 6string capo in gold and that works well
the strap i got was a levys with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable
and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i havent tried yet
and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg4 guitar stand
and i got a string cleaner by fender
i am very satisfied with my purchase
haha it made me laugh
and inside that was my lovely new guitar
this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played
the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well
this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars
i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value
this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice
this is not a toy
its a well crafted instrument
plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it
rings around the hole and stripe on the back
understandable as it was made and shipped from indonesia
so thats a consideration if youre a beginner
i prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway
it is a pleasant addition to my home guitars
its for my wife who is learning guitar
the only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming
i dont even have that
its a feel good guitar
highly recommended for the occasional strummer
the many reviews were absolutely correct
this guitar is wonderful and sounds great
perfect intonation all the way up to the octave
low action and stays in tune for days
not so pleased with the sound quality
sorta disappointed with it over all
but ya get what ya pay for
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar
it sounds good and looks really nice
i get compliments on it
this on the other hand is not a lowquality instrument
takamine makes many excellent instruments this included
it plays very loud and clear zero buzzing
yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but its an amazing guitar
this is a great guitar for the money
the sound is great and it is easy to play
only about 4134 long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs
this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price
its lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes
the result was very sore fingers
these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools
otherwise youll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup
stock strings have a warm tone
and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out
i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction
i purchased this for my 10 year old daughter
the action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up
was ready to go out of the box
if you are looking at this guitar buy it
you will not be disappointed
this was my first guitar
ive had it for about 5 or 6 years now
i taught myself to play on this
first the good   this instrument is a good beginner piece
the tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great
the fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price
it looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas
the frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good
tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well
i have never had it go out of tune while playing even when stringbending
as you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine
from simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all
i would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on
i recived this guitar today2813and its perfect
bought bass case for stratwanted extra space
books under the head stock
other reveiwer complained of the excess space but thats what i wanted
it aired in a few minutes
totally happy with service and product
this is my second case from them
build good for carry and balance
brass color lock that comes with it
however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations
the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides
i cannot be sure about other brands and models
this fits the bill perfectly
and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc
for the price this is an excellent case
these are by no means touring cases
these do very nicely for that purpose
so i recommend them but be aware of its limitations
i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it
what i like about this one is how the release lever works
on the cannon the lever was vertical
this made actuating it a less natural motion
that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use
it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy
height adjustment was also important
too low and it does not sound right
this drop clutch is just fantastic
i have used them for years and always buy the same model
nothing on the market works as well as this
best buy on the market
its amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha
depends on what you want
be aware that this clutch has only two positions  open and fully closed
too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound
too large or stiff and you will not get the sound
gibraltars model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time
i like to hit things
i use drums so nobody else gets hurt
these have the sweetest tone for batterybased abuse
my 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks
they are good and reasonably priced
they are some of the best drum sticks ive played
i have always liked these sticks
they are solid look good and feel good
you will always get quality from vic firth
only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as vaders
these are great for all around playing
ive never received a bad stick from amazon
i have a wide variety of vic sticks that i bought here on amazon
that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost
it is a great pleasure to jam on it around
sound is like its real big brother
i suppose it is the best choise for your kid
just give some days to tuners to get used to
ill also note that its even affordable while its brand new
the notes are surprisingly cleansounding coming from a guitar thats so lowpriced
i was very impressed by this little guitar
the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless
still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old
young smaller player or a
all the metal parts look sturdy and durable
note that there is no guitar cable
original posting my first mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment
it cost 99 and i figured i got less than what i paid for
it was clearly a toy and i sold it for 25 without regret
i figured she pretty much got what she paid for
a decent little 34sized traveler
i couldnt be more pleased
right out of the box everything about the instrument was spoton
it was in two words masterfully made
i figure i got at least 249 worth of guitar for 99
the sound of the current mini is classic fender singlecoil
the sixinline enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping
the neck is perfectly finished and fast
but for everyone else including fortunate children the current mini is a sweet ride
june 2014 update the mini has become my preferred goto electric
for the same reason john lennon once owned a 34sized guitar i suppose
try it and i think youll like it
that sort of irked me
despite the blemish episode it fits her perfectly
i tried to tune it using a clampon snark tuner
that really worked well to tune the guitar
the tuning pegs gears were stiff and a bit hard to turn
i plugged the guitar to my old crate amp and it sounded pretty good
my daughter had a great time getting used to it
im glad i bought it just wish it didnt come with the stains
it feels solid wellconstructed and not very heavy
i like playing it too
shell find the small stuff in her stocking this christmas
i cant wait for us to do some mother and daughter electric guitar duets
its light and easy to handle
it has a nice red paint job
it has one small pit in the red finish
it has no paperwork or owners manual
the tuners are kind of choppy
but as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better
i got this guitar for my 9 year old son he loves it
i would definatly purchase this again
thank you fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size
i had a lot of questions and concerns when i ordered this
is it worth the money
this is an amazing bargain
there are better guitars out there but not for 170
this really is a great deal
wider than a 6 string but not much
probably a centimeter or so wider
i have small hands and had no problem playing it
nice natural finish all shiny and new
i wish id bought it long ago
there are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string
it is the best playing best sounding 12 string i have ever played period
this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value
when it arrived 3 days later it was a good one
with all the other great reviews noted here i decided to buy this guitar
what a difference with the epiphone
the fit  finish speaks quality
playabilty is very good with low action and good tone
really is a great buy
the finish is much darker then the pictures online show
great sound from this bad boy
the downside for me is not the guitars fault
i knew i did right by buying the dr212
its great and stands up to much more expensive of its kind
the bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge
the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out
very playable right out of the box and very beautiful
i decided to give it a good set up
ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion
when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner
add the limited lifetime warranty and gibson support and this guitar cant be beat
you dont have this guitar
what are you waiting for
order it now while the price is this low
the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic
it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet
i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget
it stays in tune and dont let the laminated top scare you its great
still using it today 2 years later
the thing is i hate overpaying for things
to me 1520 is way too much for a guitar hanger
i bought 2 of these hangers and theyre rocksolid
i just used some 2 drywall screws
i like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to
i have an older version of this model but it works great
and no i dont own stock in the company
but do consider you means of mounting carefully
great find well worth the purchase price
just find a stud and drill in the screws theyll hold just fine
i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands
it saves room and makes the room look cooler
its cheap and the quality its great cant complain
i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele
consider it for your needs
id not buy another of these for a ukulele
it likely works fine for a guitar though
and its heavy and not stylish in my opinion
for guitars its not as good as hercules
easy to mount solid grip on guitar
this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though
very nice product great quality
rubber washers come with to size for different necks
very happy going to order more
very good item if you are a musician you need it
will hold any guitar that ive seen
its also very easy to install
its a great price and its definitely worth the investment
very good idea and holds it perfectly
purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home
im using them with both acoustic and electric guitars
overall they are attractive wellmade hangars
i love these string swings
my guitars are now out of their cases and up for display
and im planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program
they look great up on the wall
holds my acoustic 6 string great
quality product at a good price
this a very clever idea
very easy to take offput on
high recommend this to any stringedinstrument players
the mounting process was simple
you dont want your instrument plummeting to the floor
i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers
theyre holding up very well
the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall
whether thats a good thing
so maybe it is a good thing
be careful when you hang it though
it can hold the weight of any of my guitars
its easy to install and i guess its cheap
i bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall
comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly
couldnt be happier with this product
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder
the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material
if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts
it is a good purchase
i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job
i was surprised of how well this stand is made
ive used stands for over 27 years and this is the best ive owned
this was a great compromise between portabilitystorage and sturdiness
ive had absolutely no problems with it
the height is easily adjustable and the shelf tilt is easy too
am very happy with what i got for the price i paid
i have to lug an 88key weighted piano around so dont mind lugging this
its very sturdy and well built
i dont ever worry that itll tip over
solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music
very portable though the holder can be a challenge at times
this music stand is og great quality and of a great price
i have been very pleased with it
i purchased this model for home usenot for a kids backpack
im very happy with this stand
it is heavy which i knew going in
but for my purposes that is a plus
the weight makes it more sturdy
it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight
adjusts easily and holds its position
purchased after another folding stand which cost the same  literally fell apart
this one is much better although not quite as portable
you can buy with confidence
this was very easy to put together
top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable
i am very pleased with this music stand
i would recommend it to others to try
that would have been perfect
this is a great music stand
no need to over tighten the adjusters
it holds my heaviest books without tipping over
but the rub is their nonadaptability
simply slide it into position
is that this thing is heavy
ive purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one
for the  its the best buy in my opinion
on stage makes some very nice products
this music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units
anyway these seem to hold up a little better
both sound good but these last a couple weeks longer
these sound good on my electrics
the best sound i got was on my strat
good sustain and strings are holding up well
break in quickly and hold their tune work for all styles of playing
my go to strings from now on
i dont play enough to need changes that often anymore
so ive become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar
a bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good
great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers
hey jerks do you play guitar
well if you do you need strings
well you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar
if so you can stop reading
if you use strings you should buy them your damn self
while youre at it buy ten sets
seriously are you a child
daddarios last a long time for me and they sound good
also theyre on the bottom end of the price range
unless you just dont like daddario i would recommend these strings highly
i dont know a lot about guitars and strings
i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there
ive been using these strings for years
probably will never stop buying them
they are suitable for rock punk country and funk
i like the light guage
these are my goto strings
they are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding
what more do you need
they are bright and feel really good on my hands
i also bought a pack of half wound 11s to try
ill decide which to use round or half wound after my experiment
i bought these strings to try on my guitars
they sound good on a variety of models like sgles paul rickenbacker
ive been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels
they have great sustain and sound nice and chunky
i love the luster and shine of new strings feels nice ans springy
he absolutely swears by them
he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there
i have used these strings since they first came out
daddario make the best strings out there
after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin
daddario is awesome if you keep in mind that theyre on the cheaper side
mainly due to the low cost
they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune
my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion
these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality
better strings are worth the extra cost
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing
cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster
i have been using dadario strings for 30 years
i can get better string control compared to other strings
i have never experienced a string break in 30 years
i swear by these strings
these are the only strings i will use on my les paul
because you like the tone they provide
because they feel good against your fingers
i absolutely love using these strings 1046 on my telecaster and stratocaster
these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings
they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently
for the more casual player these might not be the best choice
for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these daddario strings
they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive
these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings
i get about a month of playing from those strings
of course your mileage may vary
a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings
the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside
especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time
i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings
i have always used daddario strings
ive never been disappointed by the quality
what can you say about the best of the best
these strings seem to last longer than the others ive used
i didnt hammer the strings just played easy mostly the eagles
i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened
i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing
these just did not perform as expected
giving these 3 stars is being generous
i have 5 sets to use up now damn
my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks
going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound
im still in search of the perfect set of strings
i decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls
my inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound
i cant explain it exactly
10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower
i would recommend something thicker for that though
but these are great and you should get em
any skilled guitarist knows  to use  extream  caution when tuning
these strings are just prefect and feel awesome
some say dawdareeo deahdareeo dadareeoh or deeahdareeoothers shorten it to dadds or even daddyos
took me a while to figure that last one out
i just appreciate a great value and daddario strings are just that
the name is pronounced phonetically as follows  dadairyo
a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories
i enjoy this very much
its a good brand too
i recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have
hold a tune very well and sound good
if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long
overall some of the best strings available
i get long life and very good clarity from daddarios
these arent usually my goto strings but daddarios are a good solid sounding string
they last fairly long when taken care of and dont usually break too often
i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing
these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar
i would rather concentrate on making music
my son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings
not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago
he has been getting less callous on his fingers
the tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price
ive used ernie balls on electrics for even longer
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago
ultimately theyre simply the best for the money
you can get them for less than 3 per pack if you shop around
these are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session
the strings keep their tone for a long time
can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 23 hours
i have used daddario for a number of years
im not hot about their acoustic but electric
theyre a whole new world
i like these nickel on my tele
they give them that extra twang
they are comparible in tone to dean markelys and slinkys imho
great strings and they last well
ive been using daddario xl strings since the 80s
the 10 pack price is amazing
the best strings i ever bought and ive bought them all
i got these for my electric and the ej2610p acoustic electric for my acoustic
they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy
folks ive tried them all from dean markley to ernie ball
all have their good and bad points
i have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now
only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars
been using these for years
i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer
or it could just be in my head
either way i am happy with them
these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break
one of my favorite strings for my les paul
this is my second order of the 10 pack
a local store wants 2999 for one set of these
i have however had a slight issue with certain d strings
i change strings quite often so it really doesnt matter
any less and id look dumb
ive been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30 years
they always give me consistent results
i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there
in fact i have already bought them several times
the range of thicknesses generally works well and daddarios tend to be pretty consistent
the daddario sets are good stuff
i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker
with stretching they stay in tune fine
i also use the ghs standard
010 sets and they are good too
my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale
i dont remember who makes what strings for what companies though
i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance
in my opinion daddario is the standard by which all other strings are measured
nice tone last a decent amount of time and theyre cheap
color coded ballends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention
they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming
you can pay more but i dont think you get that much more
although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars
drs last three times as long as daddario
an opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective
ive never had a problem and i wouldnt buy anything else
but i probably wont get these again
to be clear  i am quite the newbie guitar player
things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke
these strings have made me a daddario customer for life
i have no desire to buy any other brand
these strings are not overhyped
daddario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for
ive taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately
the daddarios are excellent strings and this price on the 10pack was unbeatenanywhere
came in a timely manner from sam ash
these daddario  strings are great
intonation is good and ive noticed less breakage as well
besides that i am totally stoked and happy with these
they sound great and id purchase them again
with ten packs it will likely be a while before i do so
these work well with the telecaster tone and string through design
i like the tones i get from these and the price is very good
the 10s are my choice for rock and blues
i simply dont see any reason to switch atm
i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii
i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer
rhythm and lead styles both sound great
definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future
these strings speak with a bolddefined and powerful voice
they work in a variety of applications metal hard rock jazz blues reggae etc
and respond great at any dynamic level
they feel goodsound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set
it is great that amazon stocks these making ordering convenient
daddys never let you down
i like their longevity too
they withstand a lot of play and i dont have to replace them often
the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder
if youre a froosh fan like me than look no further
these strings really are special
they help nail his tone and are slick light feel and handle bends perfectly
highly recommended for those playing bluesfunkrock
plus i mean come on john mother  frusciante uses them
one this is a long island company located in farmingdale new york
they are the leader in new technology of strings
ive been using these for years
tried others but i prefer these
id allways come back to daddarios
for this review i used the services of my supermusician friend mike
thanks for the very thorough review mike
daddario xl nickel woundregular light gauge exl110bright round wound
the strings were easy to work with on installation
also the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer
this was a bit unexpected because of the bright label on the package
i actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus
the highs were clean and bright
tough to even strech this into a full review
this is a no brainer
great strings an industry standard at a great price whats nor to love
they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most
ive been using the daddario strings for about 10 years now
us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings
after 40plus years of playing daddario rocks
probably my second favorite after ernie ball
011 gauge daddarios are good strings at a good price
the strings dont break either
great strings at a great price
nice sound for a nice price
every couple months i change something making upgrades
they sound great and stay in tune well
i usually use 9s but decided to try these 10s instead
sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that fatal blow
the exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending
these daddario exl110 strings are light responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great
ive been playing for 8 years and i own 4 electric guitars
all of my guitars are strung with daddario 10s
its really the durability that sets these apart
the amazon price is terrific
id definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon
great for bending and awesome sound
ive been hooked on daddarios for quite a while
i have also found that the ernie balls break easily as well
ive used boutique strings for many years but always come back to these
great tone great string life with a little maintenance and very reasonably priced
im a huge fan of daddario strings
tension wise at d standard 1156 is ideal but 1152 is doable
i use these light guage strings because i have arthritis
makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again
this was a good purchase
he found exactly what his guitar needed and at a good price
hes very happy with this purchase
the strings themselves are the normal color for strings
great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while
they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i8217ve played
great deal on great strings
they sound clear and bright and they last a good while
quality strings do sound different and nearly as importantly they feel good too
i have an epiphone dot and i installed a bigsby v5 on it
and a previous reviewer said his dot with bigsby fits
well it fits but just barely
the guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case
i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in
one reviewer says its made by fender
i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on
someone else seems to think its made by epiphone
sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesnt make cases
i have several epiphone 335 dots and a gibson es335
i bought epiphone cases for all of them
i couldnt see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name
my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case
how do i know that youre wondering
they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment
thats been a few years ago
the cases you get now could be made by a different company
the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar
this case will fit the 335 dot casino sheraton and the gibson es335
this case was not intended for the emperor ii
i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets
one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway
bought this for my dot
it fits snugly and is adequately padded
this epiphone hardshell case is a real bargain
nice hardware on this case
all the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid
the handle isnt going anywhere
as i said the hardware on the case is really good
for under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain
i was immediately struck by how solid this case feels
it is no lightweight either
still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price
i have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon
an excellent value highly recommended
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii
if you own a dot sheraton or a 335 you should buy this case
it comes with a key so you can lock it
this case however fits my dot custom like a glove
ive had several cases and this is one of the nicest
on a personal level id prefer it didnt say epiphone on the outside
but since it does its a good place to hide a 3000 gibson 335
but this case fits my dot like a glove
the accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings
i remember these from 35 years ago in high school band
they havent changed much dont fix it if its not broken
it is solid yet flexible in height and angle
this is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most
it will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which i love
once in place it stays there with no slipping
in this case it is a winner
delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed
this is the one you want
its a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny
an investment in your musical future
made in the usa was a great thing to see
nothing but chinese crap for sale anymore
plastic attachment clutch and extremely thin gauge metal
who knows what real quality would cost these days
love the case and shockmount being all inclusive
well i found out he uses a 990 as well
so think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional
you wont be disappointed on this buy
this is one of the best mics in this price range
it sounds incredible and at this price its unbeatable
i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks
49 for a 199 microphone at amazon
get it if youre on a budget
almost a gold but not quite
its not bad or anything just different
great product and extremely affordable
also a great mike for doing voiceovers
it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic
also this model is xlr only
merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix
a pop filter is essential
it is perfect in controlled stationary environments like home studios
i mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is
makes a fair snare drum mic
needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application
youd be better off with a similarlypriced smalldiaphragm condenser and a windscreen
i have a taylor ga4e
the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright
i tried some martins ej16s which i love on my seagull s6
however those strings just didnt have enough bass and too much highs
i bought these recently and i love them
they are much better then the original strings
very rich bass that really comes out
the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright
my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me
anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have
now off to buy some different bridge materials
edit  92212i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow
was very pleased with jp 600l pb acoustic guitar strings
600l is the exact same string gauges
053 and high e and b each increasing
the improvement in tone is in all the right places
they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time
sound really nice on my taylor 410ce
this is my first set and i am impressed
i would purchase these again for my needs
i usually use martin sps but i decided to give these a try
im pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sps
this is the best one out there bar none
really this is a keeper
that would make this one the best
this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders
i have a few planet waves products and i can safely recommend them
not a bad product just dont know how long it will last
stable and precise pick attack
excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player
i am buying more gauges too
great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it
very sheep relatives with the quantity
these picks work well and look as pictured
the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture
theres not much to say about this pick
i like medium picks and this feels comfortable
it may just be my style
the 12pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity
i ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks
they have a very comfortable feel and great sound
this headstand works like a charm
its simple portable and sturdy
to the people complaining about it falling over
plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and ive used just about every brand
for the price you cant complain
this piece of plastic is just terrible
youd be better off with a couple of books and a towel
it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable
convenient storage is its biggest plus
a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass
what a great little stand
holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you
keep it right in your case
you know if you do guitar work you need a neck stand
some sheetsstand units cost 50
this was what i needed and it was cheap
i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back
over all im happy with the purchase as it suits my needs
works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar
it makes restringing way easier its pretty stable and sturdy
it will work on pretty much any guitar
so far iv used it on my 67 electrics and my taylor acoustic
folds compact to fit in your guitars hard case or gig bag
padded to protect guitar neck
i was expecting something a little bigger
so looking around on amazon i found this handy little device
its small works well and fairly inexpensive
my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust
but dont get me wrong its still pretty strong
just dont put too much weight on it while using it
build it to your specs and have a solid stand
if not you can find a lot better head stands
this one was a huge disappointment
does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick
im back with my wood block and am happy
im using these on the mandolin
perfect for clear loud picking
when i want a more gentle muted tone i use dandrea pro 346
these are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured
i have very small hands so they work for me
they are not slippery which helps
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recordingproducing
i absolutely love these picks and swear by them
perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms
id order again if i had to
this pick is so good to play electric guitar
it is heavy and small what gave us attack
make the sound clean and bright
i always use the 100mm for guitar had to test them with bass strings
they turn out to be great
these are the thickest picks ive ever used
however i am really liking them
ive tried every standard pick  even bone silver  really expensive ones
these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite  and theyre cheap
great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin
they are small which takes getting used to though
play with the round side for a fat tone
i bought this to tote my pod hd500 around
it fits snugly but well
the shoulder strap makes me feel important
it respects my arms desire for freedom of movement
my only qualm is that its gator brand and gators remind me florida
id rather just pretend that florida didnt exist
i purchased this case for my newline 6 pod hd 500
its a well built solid case for the price
i bought this specifically for a gt100
it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it
unlike product photo and it doesnt match all my other gator bags
not a big deal but worth mention
not much i can add to the review that isnt well covered already
its a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment
but overall its a great product
mine came flattened in a little box
i wasnt happy that its form was deformed
i am using it for both some music and computer stuff
the bag is well made considering its price
you cannot even get a backpack for this price
this is a solid 4 depth and cozy padding around it for protection
be sure to check out all the dimensions though
i think i saw micro and thought shorter
im thinking of getting another because of this
but these are just wish list items
lucky this is a good option
i also use it for an older digitech pedal and works like a charm
a snug fit for the pod hd 500
works great for my acoustic dreadnought
no reason i cant make something like that on my own though
this is a really nice item and i got two of them
thats the problem with mail order
the other unit seems to be rock solid
oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar
i bought one then i bought two more then i bought two more
none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall which is good right
perfect for hanging displaying your guitars
i own 3 now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection
i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe
for now im hanging one on the wall with this and its fine
just what i have expected
looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars
easy to screw it on the wall
i bought 2 of these and will order a few more
they are very nice looking and functional too
not that a guitar should ever be considered clutter
just a note of caution though
the weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock
i would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well
im sure the screws are okay but i wouldnt trust them myself
i would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many
well worth the small price paid
the shipping was incredibly fast too as always with amazon
suggestion   find a wall stud and use 3 screws for heavier instruments
used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 strats
havent had an issue with any in the 45 months weve had them up
wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free
the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar
this not the first swing hanger i have
they are great you will love it
our son has four or more of them too
this hanger was very easy to install
if you dont your guitar will hang a bit cockeyed
it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall
this works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws
works like the picture shows
hangers adjust to required width of head stock
wood finish is nice look on the wall
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws
stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time
the stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe
concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger
the only options are the drywall anchors
they are good to go
i have two of these
they hold a variety of guitars just fine
they have different wood grains
the y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a stratocaster
the base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory
i didnt use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs
these are well worth the cost
i bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room
it looks really good almost like an ornament
it sturdy and good quality
i installed this in two minutes
i used an 1164 drill bit for the pilot holes
dont use a bigger bit
that would be a mistake
these are better and screw in
i used a manual ratchet screwdriver
a heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged
one such as the screws packaged in actual twistnlock anchors
this is a lovely wall mount for your guitar
comes with everything you need except a drill or a screwdriver of course
it is pretty and very strong
this is a good buy
we bought three of these and they are just great
mounting holes are drilled right screws pass right through and fit perfectly
comes with big beefy drywall anchors and feels just right
holds the guitar out at a safe distance
spend the extra few bucks on these and smile
quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch
i will buy more if i get another guitar
they attach to the wall with 2 screws
hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall
very sturdy well made product
they hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style
since they swivel my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks
it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation
i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows
i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again
another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site
this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths
the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck
super simple to install and very sturdy once installed
the pictures are uploaded on this product page
as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say
its a good product just what i expected
i expect to buy more of these in the future
and for its price its well worth it
holds 810 picks depending on thickness
i was using the bigger triangle kind before
the one thats more universal
but i only use the tortex pics
and they dont move around so much like with the bigger triangle one
i might have done something wrong
i read in a review that these hold six picks
ill just keep using my pockets
this pick holder works for me
it holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed
it fits my jasmine well
this product works just fine
so load the picks up
wish they would hold a couple more
i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have
perfect fit for medium picks
ease of use and durable
maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage
man this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks
do not buy  it is a wast of money
the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier
i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to
these are good dont get me wrong
however my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely
i give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated
like all of dunlop products this worked great
this dunlop ergo pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar
try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid
the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find
best purchase i have made
im neutral on this one
it works for me perfectly
i no longer lose or misplace my picks
easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in
great idea great concept and great quality
for regular sized picks its a perfect product
i love this little item
i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it
no more hunting for picks anymore
this is a must have item in my opinion
i use clayton 126mm picks a heavy pick but certainly not oversized
if i shove them in i cant get them out
also this thing is huge for the back of the neck
this pick holder is pretty awesome
its nice to have a place for picks on the guitar
they now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar
it didnt seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless
mediumheavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold
it does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005
it actually holds a couple of picks less
i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks
place it gently no need to press it too hard
i have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder
you can stick it to the guitar
does what it is designed to do it holds about 6 picks
small piece of adhesive tape on the back
the supplier refunded some of the postage
a 2 item cost 1770 for shipping
be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order
as with all dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional
it does what it is intended to do holds my picks
the picks go in and come out nicely
in my humble opinion the pictures make the product look purple
at least the ones i was sent
other than the color theres nothing wrong with them
hi i need this item for travelling and it has work very well
i am pleased i have purchased this little yet great product
nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all
it comes with one free disintegrating pick
i use it with the medium dunlop picks
i hated having to put the pick between strings
but the instructions say it should be fine
im not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra
it holds about 6 to 7 picks
pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate
picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed
it is really the best pick holder i ever had
i can put 6 7 picks on it
it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend
its almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing
is that weird to say
i have ordered several of these  like 6 or 7
they are great for holding picks  make wonderful gifts
simple but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case
this a great device to put my genuine planet waves signature picks in
i always lose my damn picks this helps
and every student ive ever had has one on their guitar as well
they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding
its just unbelievable how well this device holds picks
no further action is necessary
what will they think of next
it holds your picks and sticks to your guitar
feels pretty durable im sure it will last quite a while
had no issues in the 2 months
if youre always dropping picks losing picks breaking picks this is perfect to have
fits about 58 guitar picks or so
stickies onto your guitar wherever
great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks
it does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice
perfect size and does its job
had one pick inside as a place holder
stick tape holds it anywhere you want it
it is not expensive but the item is sort of cheap
i could have used a baggy to hold my picks
the pick holder work as described
i store my picks in there and i put it by my table
its a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done
this is fine as a general stickon inexpensive pick holder
it doesnt hold very many picks but it really doesnt have to
it costs more but has more functional value to me
that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks
best 3 ive ever spent
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy
or to the desk where i sit and play
maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument
yeah i think a few of these would be nice
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks
it does exactly what it says it does
a piece of double stick tape shaped to match the pick holder is included
the tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place
this is a decent buy below the two dollar level
reaching for pics is never a problem
i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics
dont last but a couple weeks
terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly
its cheap and it works as advertised
nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght
nothing else i can say  take it for cheap guitars
from patch cables to guitar cables i simply trust this company
so in that regard i prefer planet waves cables
it has what you want in a cable and not what you dont
so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable
these cables are nicely constructed
i bought them for home use only
home recording or just practicing
they seem to work well so far
seems sturdy enough to last a long time
i have many planet waves cables
they all work well are well constructed and are a good value
i would highly recommend any plant waves cables
ive purchased many of these cables and ill be getting more eventually
cables even good ones eventually break
these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name
if you need cables these work great
the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief
it sounds ok for the price
its a bit thinner than the average cable
i will buy planet waves from now on
absolutely no complaints about these cables
the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guidescovers and provide good strain relief
great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp
i like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std
the flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked
these do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage
i have more expensive cables but rather use these
great buy cant go wrong here
this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine
these cables are just what i hoped they would be
they work well on my electric and my acoustic
no problems at all with this product
works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from amazon
i would recommend this product
lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months
went through two of these before i learned my lesson
dont waste your money on this junk
i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk
i like the planet waves instrument cables
the cable material is very bendable and easy to work with
wowif you need a guitar cable this is it
if you have a guitar and amp you will need this
even without a guitar and an amp its still fun to have
606060 be warned this review may not help you
i got a couple of these
after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug
just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord
this cord is too flimsy
its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing
simply these are great cables
they snap right in carry sound well and come with a lifetime warranty
i havent used the cable yet but it looks new and durable
based on physical condition i would recommend this product
a simple affordable instrument cable
great sound quality meets full expectations
cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality
this was bought based on the advice of others
it worked great for about 46 months and then broke
after confirming the guitar was okay i tried a shorter cable which worked fine
you also have to get ra taken altogether this makes it a deal breaker
well expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan
that would not make it a deal breaker
best inexpensive right angle cables out there
they will last forever if you take care of them
this cable is really good for the price
would like to purchase another one in the future
ive used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count
not the greatest cord i have ever used not the worst either
once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now
great connection sounds good and no issues at all
much to my surprise this cable is pro quality
and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price
doesnt short out on you
good  cable works for me using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch
may order more as extras
works as expected and should last a really really long time
very good sound and quality
i havent measured signal throughput so i cant comment on that
but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle
what can one say about a cable
i love the fit and the sound quality
it doesnt come loose or wiggle once in place
ill get this one again
a good cable for the money
i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is
well this cable certainly didnt last long as the title says 8 weeks
bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago
messed around a bit and it started to work
today same thing and its obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp
thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasnt very happy
got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either
not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund
will just move on to another companys cord
the cable died on me in less than a month
very disappointed in built quality
it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp
havent used this one yet
always high quality for a reasonable price
it came in nice packaging
cable looks great  feels of high quality
so far it still works well
10 ft is nice for home
this is a nice cable
made from good materials and is attractive
they offer good middle of the road accessories
check them out they carry ok equipment
cables are working really well for me
i wanted mymxl 2010 multipattern studio micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it
it is thick and flexible at the same time
it curls around my microphone stand well too
nice added peace of mind
this cable simply feels strong and well made
phantom power and data transfer has been flawless
i highly recommend this quality xlr cable
update  121912still working great after 5 months
forgot to mention the nice packaging
its eco friendly and nicely packaged
it also has a lifetime guarantee
not a warranty a guarantee
that speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product
this is a xlr cable
so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest
happy to have black connectors on an xlr cable that doesnt cost a ton
not the greatest mic cable but for the price they cant be beat
the title says it best its a decent basic mic cable
it was priced right  750 usd
these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors
these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost
depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes
they make another version which is less pointy
i like that one a little bit better
the grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that
i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceasedbad dexterity
i dont this is it for meat least not on acoustic
whatever i didnt like about them got drowned out when i tried electric
i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness
i decided to give the dava picks a try
i have yet to break one
bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops
sure i can still use a regular pick when thats all thats available
but why not use the best when i can
update  been using these picks for a year since my first review
still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer
the only reason i need to buy more  i lose them
i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks
but for me they are still tops
which is why im buying another half dozen
i absolutely love these picks
grips really well in your hand plays like a dream
i just wish more came in the pack
i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks
dava picks are one of lifes guilty little pleasures
they may seem pricey for picks but theyre still not that expensive
i use these to play slide
the davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control
and they just plain feel good to use
i have been playing guitar offon for about 30 years
its crazy but that is what i am experiencing
plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking
tonewise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which i rather like
but not bad and i was using a sensitive rode condenser
this pick is great highly recommended
i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick
this is my new favorite rock pick
felt comfortable even with its larger size
took awhile to get used to but really liked it
not all picks are made the same  some are far better than others
the dava master control pick dmcp is a very nice  useful pick
ive been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin
im sure it wont wear out any time soon either
i usually use dunlop big stubby 20 picks
the attack is second to none
update 6614 still the best pick ive ever played
this is a heavy duty strap
i use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesnt fall
its the best strap money can buy
this is just your typical nylon strap a bit stiff but durable
this is a really nice strap
i figured id save a bit and get a couple more from amazon
i got them fast and saved twenty bucks
my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets
super tight and easy to lower
raising it is a different story though
i just save the fast 34lower played34 songs for last
those are the best ones anyway
this is a sweet guitar strap
i have a similar one but it has blue fire on it
so its get better as you use it
this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and doubleleather ends
the color stands out well on the black background
but for the price you get what you pay for
i would have much better liked it if they were metal
dont let the term 34nylon34 fool you
this is a really nice thick strap
nothing like those 5 cheap straps
reduces string noise as promised
makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise
also does make the neck a lot smoother
i will be buying more for all my guitar cases
i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results
it helped some but didnt get rid of the noise entirely
it also makes the strings feel nice as well
i will continue to use it
i cant remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff
ive been using this product for many years
it has always worked well for me
my fingers were squeeking  sticking on the strings  back of neck bad
this stuff has been around for years
1st time i saw it was 40 years ago
cant argue with that track record
if you never used it get a can you wont regret it
youll wonder how you ever played without it
you might even become the next joe satriani
makes the strings nice and easy to fly over
no buildup or residue on your fingers either
apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad i did
start to feel scratchy this is a quick fix until youre ready to restring
ive been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding
it claims to stop 34string talk34 when you rub fingers on wound strings
ive been using this for years
i like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease
humidity  not a problem with this stuff
for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile
it does make the strap long but is suppose to
you will have to adjust your strap from the other side
all in all this is a great product
working just fine so far came quickly in the mail
i am happy with this product and will order some more in the future
nice inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem
very serviceable easy to use sturdy
all my guitars use this quick release clip
but i personally do not like how it looks of it when installed
but that is only a personal opinion
you may see it differently
dont use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase
it does what it was made to do
i purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap
it does the job it was intended to do
im glad i purchased this when i did
i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily
i buy one of these for each guitar
but i only use my favorite strap
i think i have 3 or 4 of these
work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use
get a few just in case but i am still on my first
pretty simple even if youre technically challenged
not a pretty product but good stuff
this saves so much time for getting strap on and off
worth the money and is built well
i have two of these for my acoustics and when i get another acoustic
ill be buying another one of these
nice quick release without having to tie anything
its nice and does its job
its a quick release with the buckle
my new guitar had only the back strap connector
attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head
you now have a quick release strap holder
very well made  strong
happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to
using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic
goes one easy and feels sturdy
thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric
update 8212   ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric
like the first one works great
i just put it on my baby taylor guitar strap
does the job and does it well
glad i got this one
it is exactly what i was hoping it would be
work great for my needs
geart for setups and takedowns
does lengthen the strap a bit but works
the acoustic guitar quick release system is very interesting
some case manufacturers have the same problem
same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap
the dobro had the issue with the strap didnt have a great connector
i can just quick release it when im done
i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar
i have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me
im a gadget lover and this is a good one
this filled the bill works on basically any type of guitar
ive been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade
this is a handy little contraption
im using on one of my cheaper guitars
quick release around the neck strap system
unbeatable for acoustic especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy
i would recommend this to anyone
you can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds
it holds up very well also
ive had it for about a year now and have no complaints
a great simple idea that im glad someone put into production
i can think of a million simple solutions to that but thats another story
tends to slip on the strings however
convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck
if youre a bass player and use a pick you need one of these
i bought one for every bass and a spare
really these things are great
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists
these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics
is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone
nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle
i am glad i bought this
it is exactly what was described and it was a good price
i got this to install it on a podium
the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place
get it if you need one
we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system
in some situations they can be a savior during set up
nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well
id owned a phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one
i think it sounds fine
i gigged with it for years without issue
a phaser is a very specific sound but i love it in small doses
for my needs this one works
well i need to correct this
this review was for the old models
this is a great effect
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i returned this because i wanted the script version instead
watch youtube to compare models
this pedal seems older as well
this is a great pedal for price
no its not the most amazing phase pedal but its still quality
i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board
perfect for old van halen solos like in 34you really got me
play some old kiss or some rob zombie
34you know your man is working hard
i have several mxr pedals
every one is superbexcept for this phase 90 the nonscript version reviewed here
look up mxr phase 90 mods and eriks corner will show you how
i made the r28 c11 and c12 modifications
finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot
on no setting could i get rid of
you guessed it  distortion
the mxr phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen
in this case i agree
the mxr phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units
of the three the phase 90 has the least versatility
bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well
product is as described and fits mic perfect
will buy more in future
good cheap mic cover fits es57 ok could be a bit tighter i suppose
anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic
not much to say about foam
they do the job well
i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap
nice cover for my behringer xm8500
it is fitted snugly and well made
the color is nice and bright
this product seems to be a pretty good product
nice to keep your mic nice and fresh
i do not have much to say about this
it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine
just so i could make some sort of comment about it
if that isnt what you want then i would look elsewhere
these fit snug on my shure sm58 beta a mics
nice texture and it doesnt affect the sound of my mics
it works well hasnt broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned
now if only all windscreens were this sturdy id be a happy customer
once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was
volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear
it also protected my mic in a fall once too
can find anything better for this cheap
came in time worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic
this is worth the investment for your expensive mic
fits the behringer xm8500 perfectly
i bought this to go with my shure sm58s
it fits the mic well
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum
i also bought the green one
i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great
i would recommend this to anyone
blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store
fit very well my mic
really simple little review here
the package game a little smushed so its a little misshapen
if its not the highest quality stop complaining
its 2 what did you expect kevlar
any smaller and it would be going in the trash
the foam is obviously of good quality and its plenty thick
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations
when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it
this is a black sponge for smaller mics
i got mine for use with some behringer mics
they do what theyre supposed to do
okay  color coding is a great idea
divas will not use the red ball windscreen
because from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose
i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech
so save your dough buy any color but red
to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise
i sometimes play in a park or outside around the bbq
i would highly recommend it
what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen
well it fits the rode m1 mic i was using nice and tight
alot of zoom h1 users put this over their mics
the fit is nearly perfect
for that application this is the windscreen to get
i definately helps cut down 34wind whistle34 on my mic
cant say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad
they are well made and do work
i would buy them again
i have not tested its wind screen capabilities
bought this cover to go with behringer mic
it does what its designed to do
it could be less dense i think
geat value for the money
my daughters use all of them every week
not cheap or poorly made at all a great value
it holds a mic just fine
i just wish it had a little more 34give34 to it
use it with an sm58 shure mic in a studio type application
holds up great mic does not slip
it does whats its suppose to do
holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get
a classic mic clip  simple inexpensive and durable enough
keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break
it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce
well made reasonably priced as with most on stage stuff
these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm5758 series form factor
the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precisionmachined
i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model
what can i say it works
i think i could write a book here
just a solid little mic holder
these kind of clips can break
however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise
these clips are 116 in
in comparison the shure clips are 14 in
very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic
it hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out
great for back up singers
not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip
worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased
definitely would purchase again solid quality build
if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal
im sure it will be amazing
and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal
those are pretty crucial to a drumset
the pinstripe heads are amazing
i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great
the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk
it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it
these heads are amazing and a very good investment
make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death
these heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound
bought these and they worked great with my digitech delay reverb chorus and jaman
no noticeable noise added to my ears
they continue to work to this day
they are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap
these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables
these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price
but for the price they are great
not much to say about patches
they do what they are suppose to do and do it well
its easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops
i recommend it to all aspiring musicians
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price
welldesigned and reliable i highly recommend these
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine
may work other applications that require the same type of plug
these are great for connecting effects pedals
as the title says these are a great value and work well
i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board
these are a bit short only complaint
but i should have known that going into a 6 double right ended cable
perhaps a straight to straight would be better
anyway besides that they seem to be decent enough quality
i can see a few years of careful use
fast forward a few years and i purchase this little baby on a whim
man am i glad i did
love it and wouldnt wanna part with it
the pedal itself is built like a rock
i imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing
this is a great effect
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
bought this on a whim
it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion
when used with a pedalboard rig it doesnt add much except for hiss unfortunately
sweet sound with an older fender amp unit though
does not sound good with updated equipment line 6 equipment roland units
id say definitely do not get this if youre a tech or gear head
get it if youre a simple player with few fx in your arsenal
nothing else ive tied it to has seemed to work out though
dont go for this for modeling
this little box will give it to you
i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains
i have had several mxr pedals through the years
i have always found their quality to be very good for the price
with flatter eqs it is fairly noiseless
simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band
this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage
as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and roadrugged
highest quality guitar ive ever seen in this price range
it looks feels and sounds amazing
there were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price
to my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar
the local shop only charged me 5 to shave them down
i replaced the strings right away
im completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it
definitely worth the price you pay
its possible that i just lucked out with a good one
will confess that id like a 12string but thats another animal
dont recall if i purchased it on amazon
no fret buzz and i just love the feel of the neck
nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your back
quite sure its the same model
it is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online
i took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared
heres my takepros  cheap
90 is very inexpensive for a guitar
well packaged for shipping arrived 1 day early fair quality
it is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship but not stellar
it is a concert size which i like
it is a cutaway design without electronics
this combo is very rare
fair to good wood materials and furniture good design
this guitar sounds good feels good looks very good
its very inexpensive needs a little work sounds very good
i hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase
im glad i did  what a nice guitar it turned out to be
out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive
the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely
the jasmine s34c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price
this guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well
i am now a fan of takamine
i have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic this being the second acoustic
people are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish
it wasnt supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look
you have to see the guitar face to face to understand what i mean
this guitar i would recommend to anyone
this one fills the bill pretty well
the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well
bracing is light  the entire guitar is light
the improvement in tone was immediate  this little guitar sounds pretty darn good
it holds tune and has not failed yet
since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice
as i get better i will upgrade
i really appreciate the cutaway
how many high notes will i be hitting on this baby
who knows but it looks way cool lol
the craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb
but maybe its just my small kidlike hands
thumb to little finger i can barely reach an octave on piano
its definitely a great value
bought a takamine 40 years ago
it was an exceptional guitar for which i paid 125
adjusted for inflation that would be 800 when i bought this jasmine
i got a superb machine for the money
the first is that the finish is not as good
the second probably flows from the first
the tone is a touch wooden it doesnt sing as the old taka did
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
for its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playing
for everyone else it should fit pretty comfortably
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon
i wasnt planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar
it arrived intact and ready to play
but i cant help it  i like this guitar
quite simply this is a really nice guitar
but for less than 100 nice doesnt even describe it
my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing
nope no flaws noticeable to me
kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice
oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard
other reviews had complained about a toolow action
but mine seems dead on
but even so theres really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low
and of course the guitar sounds good
again maybe not 750 good but at least 250300 good
and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price
just click the buy it button
thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar natural
wish it came in a darker grain of wood
i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price
a value and a half
if you need a beater this is it
it plays great  great fret job and solid tone
have recommended to several students
this guitar pays better than some 3 times is value
i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents
besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost
it has much better tone than i expected and very good action
stays in tune very well
i am very happy with my purchase
love  love this guitar
little bit modify at the bridge will make great guitar
nicely sound it gaveup on what brand of strings you use
price also great with budget
best recommended for starters intermediate and pro player
get it one you will love it
my guitar is absolutely beautiful
and its got that new guitar smell
and they were right about that
it has a rich full bodied sound
i am now a diehard takamine fan
you can compare both at guitar center
first of all i am a beginner
i do not know anything about guitar
i saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets
it surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all
the string does not corroded but i changed mine anyway
the fret does not have any issue at all
and the truss rod adjustment is perfect
the action is low and the guitar structure is perfect
when my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced
he thought the guitar cost 300 above
he also bought one this morning
anyways i buy it from amazon and the packaging is great
right out of the box this guitar was flawless
i played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonationfret buzz etc
absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret
a very well built great sounding guitar
for the price you cant go wrong
i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros
i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price
a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar
its a good cloth for polishing no more to say about it
it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces
i keep it in my guitar case and use it often
this sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off
great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars
soft touch easy care  cant beat it
lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth
it either cleans or it doesnt
this cleanspolishes all of my guitars great
this is a brand ive come to trust
do not use these to polish your guitar
it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up
these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything
this does the job perfectly
is easy on the plating and very gentle
washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries
the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly
scratch free durable machine washable
takes a matter of moments and works great
polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric
it helps to clean the guitar
this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars
it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea
my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny
i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off
pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument
do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument
you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it
i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely
it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid
the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play
so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything
compared to ernie balls cloth its good enough for wiping down things
overall good cloth for general use
great microfiber polishing cloth for a great price
paid less than half through amazoncomgreat product that works very well with nitro finishes
very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth
big and wide enough to handle any guitar
works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish
i tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars
therefore after playing i always wipe down my strings to extend their life
this cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use
it is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use
i liked my first one so much that i am putting in another order
it began to tear on my guitar strings
i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses
at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth
but these ones really get the guitars shining up really nice
they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good
i bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases
i use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner
purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me
this works very good on a silver flute
this is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should
theres nothing else to say but to get it if you need it
the quality doesnt suck so dont worry about
i bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with
he really likes it a lot
it keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely
its okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new
it doesnt scratch the guitar and works great
the price is fair and it serves its purpose
im pretty happy with this cloth
well its a cloth and i use it to wipe my guitar
this is a fairly good size cloth at that
i even recently bought a 2nd just because
i really did not expect much from this rag
i was totally surprised that it actually works this good
this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too
it picks up every smudge smear  print and leaves nothing behind
a note about the mixed reviews
this item has sewnseamed edges that will not fray
no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there
i told him i would just get another
what the crap are they talking about
turns out they are talking about a completely different item
works as advertised for polishing my guitars
weve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job
with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it
ive owned this pedal for about 8 years
its good overall but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me
i think its the way they trail off
the tails tend to have a little unnatural decay or something
for that application it works fine and sounds great
but if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse
but thats been my overall experience with digitech stuff for a long time
tons of verb if you want it
makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this
i highly recommend digi stuff
purchased this to replace a behringer pedal because the behringer introduced a swishing sound
this pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless
good product and got good price here on amazon
i use this pedal mainly for the 34church34 setting in ambient volume swells
it has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse
so it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for
it is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others wont
that said i have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well
they sound good and are affordable
this is a greatsounding reverb pedal
tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound
the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use
i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u2 etc
this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy
you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit
over all i would not recommend this product
ive had this pedal for a number of years
the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well
the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting
the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible
the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal
it doesnt sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it
it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase
maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit
once i get around to playing with it i will write another review
compressionsustain wise this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise
in my opinion this is the best guitar volume pedal available
add in some delay and it will give you an organtype swell
its also lighter than the others mentioned which is a plus for traveling musicians
i would highly recommend this pedal
works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well
ive tried other passive volume pedals that didnt work
smooth reliable action and no noise too
its heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off
the tone becomes duller the output drops
i would expect that from an asian knockoff not from an alist gear maker
the signal processing takes place in the unit not the pedal
those units have their own tone problems but thats another review
major fail on their part
the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor
i have no recommendations for a volume pedal
came in perfect working condition
i recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal
go no further for your volume pedal needs
i have a heavy epiphone eb0 bass and this strap is a lifesaver
nice thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky
cons  none to speak of
perfect whether youre rocking a featherweight strat or a 16pound 6string bass
i hardly notice im actually wearing it
you will not be sorry with this purchase
leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button
this strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable
i have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars
great quality very strong and great variation of length on them
they are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders
i highly recommend this strap
bought one tried it on a pbass loved it
returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass
good product for a good price very comfortable
after adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great
now im buying another strap so i will have one on either guitar
this makes it very comfortable
i like my phat strap just fine
i like the 334 wide for my bass
fits nice and made well
seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick
the fact that it is wide is nice
planet waves makes good stuff
its long enough to allow my bass to rest at arms length
i like these well enough that i have four of them
this bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price
btw thats all i have to say so dont make me type more
this strap was great i was glad to find this well made wide strap
its not fancy but its well though out and you cant beat the value
excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass
i am pleased with the strap and the low price
i bought it for a very large body 34f34 hole electric guitar
this is a nice leather mandolin strap
fits fine on my cheap rogue a type mandolin
amazingly it is made in canada not china
the leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps
this is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin
produce is great price and good quality
it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play
ok quality and certainly better than a piece of rope
this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product
it would be hard to beat
if you are looking for a 100 leather mandolin strap consider another strap
i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut
not that many good productsaccessories for ukuleles
this one is perfect in size and price
however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock
just give it a little thought
they are correct but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle
for the bread this is a great strap
buy one and see what i mean
treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot
at least it wont fall off soon
leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes
planet waves mandolin strap brown
there is also an embossed model brown offered at minimumly higher price
i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly
enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslytotally worth the buy
it is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
i use this one spot adapter with the 5 pedal attachment
ive seen reviews about this brand being noisy
i suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version
too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle
zero hum or buzz from the unit
this is a great invention
it really saves on batteries and extension chords
it is well worth the money
this is the answer to your all your power supply needs
if you own more than 1 pedal and we all do you need this
it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug
get it youll love it
i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals
i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here
it does work well and will power many pedals at one time
i do not use it for powering only one pedal though
easy to use  it is what it is
i choose this rating cause it is the best adapter ive found
one less thing to set up carry around and worry about
i truly recommend this one spot adapter to everyone
i just tested if all the plugs work and they do
this plug works very well
i like the right angle connectors
it included a multiplug cable but not a right angle one
the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard
this original plug fits the purpose perfectly
ive got 5 effects hooked up to this thing
it fits beautifully and powers all of them at once
have no problems with this
get it you wont be sorry
works as intended and maybe more
fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant
everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage
been working without a problem to this day
its easy to install and keeps things simple
no more extra messy cabling
thanks to amazon for the quick delivery
bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesnt cost much
i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila
highquality cable for expanding the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v power adapter
distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards
whats not to like here
good quality wired correctly cant complain
its probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes
i have 2 of these actually
it does what it should
of course if youre running a chain of drivedistortion pedals youre asking for it
powers up to five 9v effects using one power supply
i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly
no more dead 9v batteries
i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals
no tone loss at all
great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply
hard not to like that
its worth its weight in gold
and rockisland sound sends it out fast
you can count on me for future purchases
i used this along with a dunlop dc adapter and it all fits nicely
im powering a zoom ms50g and a fulltone ocd
it will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs
cant always get what you want
this product works as advertised but you should beware
one spots come with an 8pedal multi plug
very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff
the good news is you do not need to buy converters for them
works as expected and should last a really really long time
thing is great for multipedal use
this is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
i used this with my planet waves 9v adapter
it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful
really nice product for the price
this product isnt really one to review but it does what it advertises
great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks
its a well build daisy chain dc power cable
it has good lenght between two plugs
you wont have difficulties to plug your pedals
this multiplug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals
if needed in the future i have these extra plugs
i recommend this multiplug to everyone
now i power all my pedals with one power supply
every guitar ive ever cared about has had this strap on it
the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use
i have them installed on all of my guitars
after a dunlop lock failure i decided to change over
i was worried that the plastic clips wouldnt hold up but they do
i feel 100 secure that my guitar will not fall
they look good as well and they are easily adjustable
my transmitter pack slid on with ease and i was ready to go
a lot of bands i have seen on the road use these straps
it holds incredible its not coming out now for sure
2 i use the black white and blue colors
through sweat dirt and cigarette smoke they eventually start to look nasty
i would suggest going with the black for this reason
its just a plastic clip and anything can fail
all dimarzio products are incredible
works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks
id use it for lightweight guitars
using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder
i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage
well made product strong and looks good
i love this strap try one you wont be dissapointed
like always dimarzio products are simply the best
just arrived in good shape
polish w an expansive polishing cloth
it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine
mine didnt come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though
for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish
the cloth is just what i wanted
it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument
the polish in the bottle works well and the lintfree cloth works well too
just feels right for the job
although the cloth i got was black and not yellow just pointing that out
it works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror
i can see my reflection perfectly clear
also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
have to try them more and with other amps
by now they work really good and no interference where detected
at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot
great sound quality and durability
i will not buy any other cable except planet waves
i have many planet waves cables
they are all very well made
i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar
fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out
i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days
this cord did not work right at all
it seems like there is a short in it somewhere
i had to unplugplug maneuver into place
i have a monster m rock12 cable
put up against these i fail to distinguish the difference in sound
these cables are the only cable i will ever use from now on
they last for ever and never cause buzz or noise
these are the only ones i buy now
not the best but not the worst
i havent noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about with these cables
affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchase
i would recommend these cables and will buy again
other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends
measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or so
minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar
the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves superhandy elastic cord wrap
these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price
been using these cables for three months now
i use them with azoom g1n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great
i have had no problems with them at all
however for the price and purpose this a five star cable
the gold plating ensures a solid connection
or so their packaging claims
i have not had to replace mine
these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable
ive been using this one for about a year now with no problems
i really like the durability and clear sound quality
first off im a big fan of daddario strings and their planet waves division
i dont really know if its better than other brands or not
but it does the job and its well made
doesnt make a difference in the sound
i dont know but i am satisfied with this purchase
i definitely recommend trying out a set
theyre also quite good on les paul style guitars if you like slinky strings
but if youre not too picky this will suit you very well
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length
about the same tension as 9s on a strat
so dont want 9s and 10s too tight then 95s it is
guitar string 95 between 9 and 10
im really happy with this daddario purchase
honestly the strings are great
they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings
my goto string brand for any stringed instrument
i popped my e string overtightening it when i was setting it up
i replaced the factory strings with these
im told it sounds better now
i think so as well but i cant quite quantify it
amazon seems to have great prices and its nice to have them delivered too
they will last and last and last and give you great sound
easy to put on and tune
im normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever
my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings
all of that said the strings are pure joy to play
i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it
a solid favorite around my house
fat and deep snappy when needed
best articulate bass string for the money
i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued
they sound great and stay in tune
think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier
nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick
i am not a slap style player so i cant comment on that
i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible
try them youll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy
they have a really nice sound and dont cost an arm and a leg
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these
so these are  pretty great strings
the price is really good
about ten dollars a set which is really good
these strings are quite durable and longlasting
the colorcoded end balls help with the restringing
i really cant complain about anything
i was an ernie ball guy for a long time
but i was getting pissed because the ernies kept corroding so quickly
so i tried these and they seem to hold up better
and of course they sound excellent too
ive use these strings for years
i play often and like to change strings often
they hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out
my guitar originally came with daddrio exp and they sounded good
this time i got a 3 pack of ej163d light
but the sound is the problem
crisp tone distinction is just not there
i thought light would be the better route but now im not sure
i purchased some others to try
also since a purchased a 3 pack
when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy
these strings from daddario are a personal favorite of mine
i love the ej16 light gauge for their size and ease of use
not only that but they sound great
not too big or not too small
i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass
i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends
to me this makes it much easier when changing strings
you dont have to worry about mixing up your strings
ive also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands
i think youll be satisfied
only issue they break easily
but they last a long time and sound great
crisp and fresh tone for a long time
these are the only strings i use on my acousticelectric
love the sealed bags to keep the air tight seal
i havent tried many different strings
iif the strings break i will try this one gs330s as well
over all i think daddario is great for warm balance tones
im happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings
these sound great and last a long time for me
put em in your case and dont be unprepared
i play resonator guitars open tuned
strings theyre all i use on my acoustic
great guitar string at a reasonable price
i like the ej 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar
im going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light
its smooth to use and the sound is superb
the sound is clear and warm on my yamaha and my martin
let your guitar be the judge
these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks
their tone is slightly bright but not as 34harpsichord34 as the exp
these are the strings for takamine guitars
instead it was only 2 cheaper than buying at my local music store
other than the price the strings work great on my guitar
ill definitely be buying more of these
the lighter the less tension you should use
i love the price and they last me quite a while
this gauge is perfect for my 1970 gibson j50
i will keep this short
thats only my opinion and everyone has one
it made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar
i really believe in these strings
on a guitar strings are everything
the tone feel and bend is whats important
i guess they think you need big think strings to produce volume
some will disagree saying they break if theyre too thin
my thick stock strings were killing my fingers
again someone will chime in and bash me for saying this
i have no plans of changing brands now ive made the string switch
some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway
i can do a string changeover in about 15 minutes on a bad day
i dont plan on hammering my acoustic anyway
thats what the fender is for
and its not that im cheap either
i own 18 guitars 16 of which are electrics
but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin
5 stars in my book more if theyd allow that
the way you string the guitar makes a difference
with practice ive become more proficient
curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate
then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm
try to practice for about an hour daily
the tone as i say is pretty darn good
im a 62 yo newby to guitar
this proves that easy helps
sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play
tried them and he was right
these really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars
daddarios are the best and i love the ball end color coding
this coding system is consistent thru all their string sets
have to reorder soon  great strings for the money
i tried these strings on my zager guitar
the are certainly ok and play fine
they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager
just a little cheaper in cost perhaps
maybe they will last longer
these have not rusted so far
daddario strings are simply the best
the brightest tone normal lifespan fair prices and louder than the rest
i have played guitar professionally for over 27 years
these strings are the best all around for tone clarity punch and volume
i hate their new packaging
they used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves
kind of aggravating but no friggin way would i ever use another string
i compared these and other daddarios to other manufacturers
they were much louder and cleaner
buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately
darrario does sell some fine strings
i would not hesitate to buy them again
goodsounding and playing allaround strings
these strings are great with my acousticshowever lately ive been using electric strings instead
they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing
my favorite strings for 30 years
have used daddario strings since the late 70s
always a great sound at a great price
far as i can tell good strings
they do the job and they feel great
i got exactly what i expected
good strings for the price nice ring to them
i have used all kinds of strings
these are what i use on a regular basis
they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive
most of all they are cheap
beautiful solid tone and no buzzing
this is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments
the strings last a long time in my opinion
i have always liked daddarios packaging
daddario is my favorite string hands down after almost 40 years of playing
i will definitely recommend these
ive been playing for 40 years
some guitars sound best with phosphor bronze
some sound best with 8020s
ive been through my john pearse phase
i dont know if thats still the case
anyway the bottom line is that daddario phosphor bronze are my go to string
they set the baseline for every guitar ive ever owned
in some cases ive decided something else sounded better
for many guitars including my j45 theres nothing ive found that ive liked better
bottom line  dont follow leaders
but daddario pbs are a great place to start
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes
ive used these strings for longer than id care to admit
string sound is a personal thing
these work better for me than any others ive tried
to my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum
the five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste
others may prefer a different sound
i put these strings on every acoustic i own
they sound great and are priced right
you cant go wrong with daddario strings
i played with light acoustic strings for a long time
i tried these and they make for much easier action
do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings
ill probably stick with extra light for awhile
they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers
a little to thick for my style though
they make a very deep and loud noise
i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic
they sound much better and arent quite as loud
however these ones are great
i like the sound they provide and the price is nice
im a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only
these seem fine to me
good tone and they stay in tune
these strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers
my acoustic guitars seem to like them too all except my 12string
i have not switched form martin strings on that guitar
i switch acoustic strings 34 times a month on my 2 main guitars
i gig 12 times a month
these last long without compromising the tone
i tried every brand until i got to these
not sure why i did not try them earlier
probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide
i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install
these are my goto acoustic strings
they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity
ill be sticking with these for the long run
extra light gives good action for my small guitar
not so hard on the fingers
tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge
daddario always puts out a nice product
the e and b strings never have enough coating but still
this brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings
to me they just sound complete
they complement my washburns very well
but its been a trial  error for me
always buy daddario strings for my 7 guitars
they have a great rating from other musicians
and the price is very affordable
highly recommended by this writer
it is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings
it is a bit like discussing our likes in food musicians movies
we all have our likes and dislikes
i like their full sound and their lasting tones
after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase
no desire to test other strings
im going to be honest i have a cheap guitar
bonfires sitting around the house etc
the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips
daddarios are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics
i gave these strings a try but i dont care for them that much
im enjoying using this pricedright set of strings
i bought these primarily because they are so cheap
the quality is good i would say  not great but not terrible either
they sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull
for the price though its hard to knock on them too much
luckily i bought the three pack
but i cant recommend this product
i went with the mediums
try the light if you are a beginner
i really like these strings
good sound and the feel is good
not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however
anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing
the issues include what i think may be premature breakage
ive noticed that the current 34most helpful critical review34 mentions this same problem
they sound great for my style of play equipment and setup
i just wish i had a better feeling about the premature breakage
it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar
these went on with no problems
they have a brassy sound to them
since purchasing them they still ring nicely
great strings and the best packaging
the result was poor sound
switching to these 10s made a huge difference in tone
they are also easy to do bends which i like alot
i have never broke a daddario acoustic string
they last with great tone for a reasonable time and dont break
just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on
hope this helps some novices i had to learn it this way myself
i have multiple guitars for different styles
i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads
good tone good sustain and they stay in tune
i play 2 gigs a week on average and practice everyday
these strings are what i use on all  of my acoustic guitars
the sound and tone are great and the price is right
they shipped quickly and i will order again and again
i have restored an old rex commander
yeah i know  never heard of it
beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck
frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing
not to mention how great they look
the snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me
terrific strings for the price of cheapies
im glad i chose them as they play easily and have a nice sound
not much to say here
strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player
these are the best sounding in my book
they last pretty long for noncoated strings and play nicely too
these didnt last long at all
i dont play my martin very oftentoo busy with electrics
but these were trashed in a month
guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now
overall i rely on daddario strings for all my instruments
beyond great tone  playability these suckers are reliable as all getout
the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir
dont get me wrong though i still like these
if theres a sale ill buy some more
its tri pack with great quality strings on good deal
i purchased 2 of this set and it works great
it sounds balanced warm and bright
this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good
anyone needs string go for it
received in just a few days
one of those duh things i didnt even think of until just now
the sound is excellent the playability comfy
the tone of my ovation was back
here are my itemized observations  first three sets for 13 currently
cannot beat the value for price
what many people call 34bright34 brilliance is the opposite of 34dull34
some strings sound dull right out of the package
its a pleasantness that doesnt grate on your ears when you pluck a string
at first the e overtoned the b and e
the 1253mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers
thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars
lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action
martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow daddario just shines
thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try
i have used daddario ej16 pb lights for years
the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them
these strings i put on my taylor ga4e
they had a very nice and balanced mids and highs
these strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely
nice mids and ringing highs
not a lot of bass
but very nice balance as i said
i started experimenting on strings ill try using bronze strings
when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer
i would recommend others to try it
no trouble stringing or tuning either set
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic
the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone
these and reds are my favorite acoustic strings
these are a little brighter than reds and are best for live playing
the strings are well made and ive never had an issue with quality
8020 strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar
phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine
8020 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out
they did nothing to help my overbraced 1970 gibson j50 though
phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap
have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar
like them and never an issue
nice bright tone  and last a
i like the tone of daddarios 8020 bronze strings
it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear
these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive
with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else
they sound awesome on my acoustic
not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge
i bought a case of these
i cant handle 12 strings and the sound of 10 is terrible
i prefer 12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands
not the fingers but the hand and wrists so
011 strings are what i use
there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well
i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix
other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems
i use it in front of my shure beta 58a and its absolutely perfect
works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises
this is a beautiful shock mount
however for the price it didnt perform
might even get a blue mic
nice works and no problem
so far the so good used for almost a month now
they work and they last
i was not happy with the sound of these strings
the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny
spend the extra 2 its well worth it
i was really impressed by the sound
they stay in tune very nicely
great for beginners and intermediate players
they are cheap and look good
they also have a nice full sound and are holding up well
ive used daddario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic
its very stable and in tune all time while playing
this string compares significantly to the proarte string
the sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less
its so similar i contacted daddario to ask them what the difference was
whatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture
and daddario never produces junk
or if you like both equally
whichever set one ultimately chooses cant go wrong with the qualityprice ratio
i wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play
i am very pleased with the price and the quality
they take great care to pack it well so no worries their either
buy this if you want a started that isnt bobo or a toy
and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup
it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation
one can find info about mandolin setup on the web
this will be my beater mandolin at 25 nothing can beat it
so this is more than adequate for daily practice
often times it even stay in tune the next days
i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one
there was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke
i tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs
the strings that come with it work fine and none snapped
if you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out
i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin
do they sound as good as a 5k gibson f5
also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash
just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something
decent strings dont cost very much
its been holding up well
one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these
same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new
this is one of the few cases where id buy new over used
again though not that big a deal to fix if its not
oh as stated elsewhere these dont have trussrods
thats not bad in itself
even from some big makers
it was the strings and im very glad i replaced them with these strings
they make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well
im very happy with the purchase
dont panic strings marked adfb can be used just fine for gcea tuning
they were for a 20 uke
and yeah new 4 strings do improve the sound on a 20 uke
although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder
aquila seems to be the most popular now
i have used both and i am satisfied with both
i play the soprano concert tenor and baritone
each one different in it on right
also play the the concert scale banjolele
these are great strings for such a rare instrument
these strings sound full and warm on the instrument
these will work for soprano
the j53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks
increases projection and tone to any stock strings
not the best not the worse strings but an improvement
these daddarios have worn quite well and still sound excellent
first off im no ukulele expert
immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings
the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well
i would definitely recommend these
so while i got this for my soprano ukulele
not much to say really other then they are good strings and work
the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less
and i like the sound better
string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad
guess ill go back to daddario and ernie ball
playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever
these blue steel light strings sound like gold
the crisp and solid vibration is just top notch
probably better than any other light strings ive bought
so far they are great
these strings feel great and sound fantastic
very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows
nothing sounds as bright as these strings
ive tried many and these are the best by far
i know cause i playem geetar real goodlike
i dont have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers
i honestly didnt notice anything different
these strings did that just fine
the guitar now sounds great
if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster
i can afford to pay twice as much
but i am going to keep using my dadario strings from now on
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking
i wouldnt be surprised if they are made from china
042or save some money and go withdaddario exl120 electric guitar strings super light 942
they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course
if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues
pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit
steel will wear down your frets a lot faster
the windings brokeon the dstring at two places where the string fretted
allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone
this is because prior to the mid40smost strings were made of nickel
or so the historical theory goes
i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers
the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board
definitely not the strings though
any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally
so if you do get a bum string give them a holler
now get out thereand play your heart out
oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it
i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint
absolutely tickled with the look and performance
makes any guitar look so much classier
i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too
installed easily in 3 different guitars so far
im very happy i bought them
these look great on my guitar
i was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didnt
i would recommend these they look great
the ones i got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture
i use these pins on some of my 34 size guitars
i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f335 and they look stunning
unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this
overall i am quite pleased with these
my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree
qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins
one u never have to worry about breaking them
they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain
it works really well and its really thin
its thinner than i thought
the price its about right
i mean these are cables
compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board
very handy for making it all just right
i will buy these again for sure
had them over two months a they work great
its very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits
these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price
i love the flat low profile right angle plugs
ive never had a problem with these patch cables
im running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out
they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what ive experienced
i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space
i had other cables on my pedal boards
i replaced everything with those
i love these patch cables
they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it
audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables
once you setup your pedalboard
thats it you arent going to move stretch or step on these cables
so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue
packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require
ive had it for almost 3 years now
if youre a purist dont ever use a pedals or even electric guitar
they have good signal though and dont seem to alter the tone
if youre considering buying this just do it
i typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars
they work very well for my needs
this strap is perfect for those needs
i would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap
these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently
its quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily
for stage i like something heavier
the holes work with my strap buttons okay
but this strap works okay with it
great price for a simple strap at around 5
i bought this during the black friday sale
material is similar to my messenger bags strap
reasonably comfortable but i dont want it cutting into my neck
bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from
nothing at all fancy about this strap
two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide
will do the job until you find the one of your dreams
i got two of these but wish i had got better ones
using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical
bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job
my experience with these straps has been great
the straps have petabs buckles and are easily adjusted
ive not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking
for the price the functionality is excellent
i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware
i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures
good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall
affordable and comes in many colors
works perfectly for me it does got a nice made
plus nothing could beat its price so get it
rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap
its not fancy but it doesnt need to be
i was a little skeptical having used other strap lock systems
but i took a chance  this works well on my lp
the strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots
me not so muchill just leave it hang
i bought this strap for a esp ec1000 les paul style guitar
i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price
when i got the strap i was impressed
the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar
locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open
its not going to unlock on you
good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar
long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable
nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar
its fine for the price
you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps
i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while im playing
that prevents a lot of damage
this is a very very nice guitar strap
comes with dual locking strap holes on each end
i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one
very good for the price
second both straps were not adjustable to 5934
both mine measured 4534 from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended
im really sick of these amazon substitutions
for what i paid i wont bother returning them
if you see a price drop below 495 dont buy
its probably not the product thats described here
these locking ends are the ticket
they are quick to release and adjust and fit very well
the strap itself is plain but it highlights the beauty of my guitar
its a must for any rambunctious guitar player
pretty basic strap but durable and works for me
if you want a strap for 5 you cant expect the moon
i bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price
the leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps
both ends are the same  leather
although the strap ends are light plastic theyve held up well
the nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear
i wasnt all that happy with this strap connected to a les paul
i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it
it wont a guitar break
you can count on planet waves quality
i like its simplicity and reliability
it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it
it costs 5 or less delivered
what more could you ask for in a strap
spend a few more bucks and get a padded one
this one is comfortable for 10 mins then its cramp time
once locked theyre not going anywhere
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice
this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought
i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by
this is a good product
this is a great product for a beginer
these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price
i bought 2 to try them out and i intend on buying more
this is a good quality strap
it is wide and has leather ends
cant go wrong for the price
this is not my first planet waves locking strap
but for me these work just fine
this is a palnet waves and just as good as the more expensive ones
material is rougherbut thats a good thing
great quality for such a low price
fits the instrument and old mexican acoustic and feels comfortable
they arrived before the promised delivery date
it fits good and came in the color i expected
but there was one thing wrong
the strap had a small stain
it said it was brand new
works well for my guitar
it holds where i left it over a year ago
i dont use it all that often though
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build
this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply
i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal
it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables
pair this up with a pedaltrain board and youve got yourself a sweet setup
this device is the best you can buy
come with all cables needed
this power supply is great for me
i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great
this is a great product that does what it says
its a tad pricey but all in all well worth it
other than that its a great device
this is simply the best power supply out there
everything is so quiet with no hum
id love two more ports
but i guess you cant have it all
play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick
well worth the small cost
ill still recommend this wedgie
for the money this is one of the best products ive reviewed
dont play another show without these
love the security of having my picks within grasp
great product and great value
i would highly recommend this to others
not much to say here but is really nice to have around
it is exactly what i wanted for a great price
mediums do great but the thin fall right out
first it a great price  about the same as a big mac lol
second it fits great  does exactly what its supposed to do
simple solution to a simple problem
fits all standard mike stands
stays where it is supposed to
the perfect accessory for the stage or studio
i really wanted this to work but it doesnt
dont botherit doesnt mute the strings at all
one star just for it getting here on time
cheap easy to use cuts sound 70
ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment
if you want 90 sound reduction however you will need a metal mute
this one works better than the smaller rubber ones
glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin
it will put the sound down
i works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it
try reversing it and youll see what i mean
if used correctly this mute works well
as you can imagine i need to practice a lot
my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing
especially when i practice monotonous scales
easy to put on and take off
the rubber wont hurt your violin bridge or strings
you can barely hear it in the next room
my violins tone doesnt change much at all with this mute
now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me
nice to use to muse your violin
a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing
it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument
sorry  i had rather not comment until it is used
i bought a glaesel bridge  this glaesel rubber mute together
i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews
this item does not work and is a total waste of money
i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all
takes the edge off the violin sound
im not sure how much i can say about a mute
its easy to put on and take off and it does its job
it mutes the violin to a reasonable level
with the mute it dropped to 6db
with accessories tonal quality is typically important
but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate
this pedal is solidly built and works as advertised
if youre using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicely
i got this pedal recently
all in all its a pretty nice device expecially for the price
it has a nice big pedal for big feet
i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal
this was not thought out very well
one final note about behringer
they seem to get bad marks now and then
i really dont understand why
i really like all of them
i have never had any problem with any of these items
they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price
the pedal itself works perfectly fine
using it as a foot pedal controller on my korg triton le
great foot switch that is easy to use
i figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment
wish they had put that in some instructions
if its there i missed it
pedal is not working it just making noise
actually it looks like used pedal not like new
one gets in the way of the other
i might modify it for that
this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described
used this foot pedal for a and so far ive had know problems
replaced the battery only once
good product for a inexpensive foot pedal
my curiosity didnt end there though
so whats up with the 12 volt adapter spec behringer
did you think you could fool all of us out here
ill probably get used to it eventually
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position
but i stand in front of a mic on stage
the pedal generates  a lot of 34noise34 so i cant use it
you get what you pay for
my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2
as far as a cv controler
it sucks at that too
im betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it
also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little
good luck if you buy it
bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot
great quality for the money and works well
one was an ev and the other a rather costly older peavey
these mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response
i feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks
great value  highly recommended
this is the best mic for its quality and its price
perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable
i will buy another one of this
i like this mic very much
it sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made
excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise
does not have an onoff switch which is a bit disappointing
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made
but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected
these are not shure sm58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs
another strength of these is durability
no damage at all to any of them
mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters
the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable
if you want sm58s you need to buy sm58s
you can pay more and get less
bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube
so it was something that was necessary
and not waste of money or an unwanted item
sounds identical to my shure sm58 but much less
i bought this to use in childrens church
it has held up with all the kids using it
great value for the price
works great especially for the price
its light and has great sound for interviews
i am a user of behringer products though own 2 of their amps
this is a great quality microphone and at a good price
keep it mind it is xlr for those that havent noticed
xlr is a better quality than other connections
and is much better quality
its flawless in quality and doesnt give any feedback
i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price
it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music
for 25 bucks i dont think you can beat it
i may buy some more of them
it is not too short as one reviewer complained
it is a standard length just like the sm58
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week
i dont expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me
there is no onoff switch this really pissed me off
but this is my fault i should have read the 1 star review first
the photo shows no onoff switch however this does not catch any attention
it only says what the product does have
oh well i got stuck with two microphones without onoff switch
i can buy an adapter with onoff switch for microphone
wow wow i cant believe it working wonderful
im using it karaoke online in paltalk
i did compairation with somes i have its perfect vocal
i connected it with mixer alesis 8 input
i wish its built with switch onoffrecomend to buyer
i have recently been very impressed with some of behringers products
i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one
at 25 i figured i could chance it
i used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show
i was expecting a soso mike for the price boy was i surprised
this is a high quality microphone
sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent
works great with my new mixer
built very sturdy with metal and not plastic
shipping was great along with packaging
this is a very nice dynamic mic
i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word
i have many microphones and this compares to the 50
i really wanted sure sm588217s but the budget did not allow it
but these microphones were a game changer for me
i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges
i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end
i bought it myself as a kind of experiment
the spherical receiver makes the xm8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands
the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand
here are a couple of more casual notes 1
the mike in the picture looked bluish to me
what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish
the product description seems to report a weight of 85 ounces
i measured this mike at 103 ounces
the mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16000 hz
the mike doesnt have an onoff switch perhaps its  only real deficiency
these switches really are very handy
this is a great microphone
it fits easily into all the recording equipment im using
it gives me great sounds
so i ordered this one to replace it
working great on my stratocaster
feels good to switch positions solid and quiet
i shouldve bought this to replace the original switch from the start
the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry
ive wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently
dont know if their qc has gone downhill or what
it would have 5 stars but for the recent failures
bought a couple of these to build preloaded pickguards for strats
they work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips
this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm
im sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways
they are good quality screws
i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these
they fit great and plenty of screws
i am going to replace all my old screws with these
thats what makes them so much fun to play and modify
these are exactly what the doctor ordered
these are well made and dont strip when screwing in for the first time
if its a new project always drill pilot holes anyway
i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used
almost time to order another set
i store them in a little sandwich bag
pretty disappointed in the color
perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard
i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result
perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad
some are very dull looking
ok so they are just screws
but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one
and it is fender licensed
they work no issues handy to have on hand
this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar
i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality
worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose
what can i say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place
they fit in the factory hole without a problem
nothing fancy they just work
fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar
normal pickguard screws nothing special here
i will purchase again for my next build
authentic replacement screws if you need them
finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem
also used these for the tremolo back cover
and no digging the the parts bin for screws
screws just the right size
shipped free as an add on item at the time
i cant believe these were actually sent to me
the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened
they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china
i am sending them back
there is no way i would use these
any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive
came with more screws than i needed
they were the right size
you shouldnt be disappointed with this item
i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster
i didnt notice any change in tone
it just worked like the old one
but the main this is that it worked
and my tele sounds as great as it always did
comes with a capacitor so thats a bonus
these pots are cts and have a nice tight feel compared to alpha pots
sounds great for my telecaster and my stratocaster guitars
capacitor are a nice generalized  choice
i was a little disappointed
1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10
they are ctls so im a bit confused
i will be upgrading the caps
ive never had one of these pots fail on me
never had one go scratchy
ordered 6 and out of 6 i have exactly zero flat washers
caps are marked 223k so looking that up they are 0022uf
pot lockwasher nut and cap are what is included
al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto
y con una buen duravilidad
i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot
it works like a champ
im a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only
these were purchased for my parts bin
they fit they work they are quiet and they wont make your life miserable
thats all i want from replacment parts
its a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness
nice big lugs to solder to
good upgrade for my squier deluxe strat
i used this on my last stratocaster build
it arrived quickly and was well packaged
it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase
mine was shinynew and was an absolute perfect fit on my mexistrat
the price was the bestanywhereand with free shipping i couldnt be happier
it fit my american vintage 70s strat
my guitar had an 11hole pickguard
i ordered an 11hole pickguard and it fit like a glove
the guitar is 3ply plastic blackwhiteblack
this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like
i am happy with the purchase
i have a candy apple red squier surf statocaster
came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd
switch it for this black one
looks great really classes it up in my opinion
i also got black knobs as well
fit my 07 mim strat perfectly
looks like a whole new guitar now
the cheap china copies on ebay dont fit
i didnt need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
i needed a jack plate for my custom stratocaster build and ordered this one
it was far better than i expected
it is very heavy duty great chrome plating
not at all what i expected for the money
nothing but the best going on this guitar including this plate
was upgrading the chrome on an mim
includes screws and 1 washerfor the jack
happy with it  like it
worked perfectly for my latest guitar project
not much to screw up
good quality parts on an essential product
and no surprises works like a champ
a fender aftermarket product that didnt come with some sort of defect or problem
not a lot of moving parts on this piece
lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body
this is my second fender polish cloth
the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me
it gets softer with time and use
overall i have to say that im satisfied with the fender polish cloth
i love waxing my guitars
these stay in every case i own
works well to keep finger prints off
should make a couple of different sizes
but these for the price work fine
great price on a highquality polishing cloth
not much else to say about it  it polishes my guitar very nicely
says its easier to use than the smaller cloths weve gotten before
use the cloth often to polish my guitar
the fender logo makes it look legit
recommended to one and all
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session
a guitar is an investment and you should protect it
a good polish cloth is a must
and i even predrill it
a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up
this was exactly what i needed and worked out great
it would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons
i ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons
i have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons
these were filler items for a much larger purachse
this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out
comes with the screws and the 34cotton34 washers so you dont scratch the body
you cant necessarily go wrong with knobs
i like the black look to my guitar now
guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on
will try other brands next time
they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job
what more could you ask of strat knobs
they will last for a long time and they are a good product
bought these for my squire strat
i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips
these nobs fit great and look great
typical plastic durable and looks good
i have an abundance of strat parts
the customer liked them so much he kept them on
now what to do with these other knobs
the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however
back plate has a greenish tint and is single ply not 3ply as advertised
color wasnt as advertised its more of an offwhite than a vintage cream
but i guess its close enough considering the price
shipping took far too long
you can never go wrong with real fender parts
used these while putting together my personal bluesclassic rock frankenstrat
replaced everything but the body
needed these accessories to match a brand new fender pick guard
they worked fine at a great price
this is the 2nd set of these fender parts ive ordered
15delivered is about the cheapest priceanywhere
they look great and fit perfectly
i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats
my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent
not the most beautiful thing but worked
the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly
fyi  parchment is slightly off white
might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasnt done by shipping
i definitely will be using this seller again
i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking
i got the aged white
i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound
this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one
i have a mim 2012 strat every thing went together with out any issues
best price online and the shipping was super fast
i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar
i didnt need no adaptation to install it on guitar
other than that they look cool in the package
kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point
it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way its supposed to
maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean
all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it
i love the tone and the reverb for 100 is amazing
for such a small combo this amp really packs a punch
it is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs
the high gain channel is really fat sounding
for the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion
plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol
i am very pleased with my frontman 25r
i purchased as a practice amp
that is all the volume i need for practicing in my home
you could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10
i would recommend it as a good economical all around amp
i purchased this for my love of playing guitar
i like blues style and classic rock
this 25 watt amp will get the job done
it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means
after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew
so i had no bass control
took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings
i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen
its just a practice amp
the locking diecast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure
the color is darker than pictured on amazon  black powder coating
i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse
do take note that this stand has a us standard 58 top
i recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand
great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic
very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing
this stand is basically dead weight
thats exactly what i wanted from a desk stand
i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band
features  stable base good extension easy hand grip to lockunlock for adjusting
for me it was a good perchase
base is heavy and sturdy so your mics wont topple over
but an arm on it and that could be a different story
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic
would need a heavier base for use with a boom
make sure your mic holder fits
great for the desktop and vocals
i have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet
its an important component in my studio
the adjustable stand also works great and wont fall on you or anything
if not just buy a cheap about 6 adapter like i did
perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic
add 34apogee one mic mount34
this is a great stand
the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand
it does and it does it well
very solid build never felt cheap in any way
perfect for its intended use
i purchased a second one after using the first for one month
would buy again should the need arise
this works great for micing guitar amps
i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum
these are heavy duty and well made
it worked once when i originally set it then kaput
its never worked properly since
i would not purchase this product again
after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand
i highly recommend this product
use this for my desk mic at home
worth every penny and then some
i loved it very much
it is very sturdy and stable
works for my behringer xm1800s mics
it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already
idk what mics use that but is something to note
not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand
does the job of holding a mic
i bought this stand to mic a kick drum
still its wellconstructed and would make a good desktop mic mount
i like on stage stuff
good value and good function
the mistake i made was buying them hastily
i needed nylon core strings
i loaded them up anyway
ive used several different kinds of strings over several years playing
im no expert but these strings sound good to me
subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing
if you havent tried em theyre worth a shot
awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced
im hooked to bronze strings
thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings
i only needed one string but it works fine
these are good strings but not 5 stars good
and i have spares for later or to share
martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar
they last and they stay in tune
i enjoy this product and i definitely use them on my acoustic
these and the extra lights are great strings
they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had
now im stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings
they play great have nice action and tone
i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great
these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again
martin is a name that means quality
martins are no doubt excellent strings
the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup
heres where you get those strings
have not used the strings yet i bought them as back up
for the price of these strings you cant go wrong
however compared to elixers the sound just isnt as 34full
this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice
the martin m140 strings are good strings
they play well and last reasonably well
i had them on my yamaha fg700s
it was a great item
it looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar
great guitar strings and affordable
i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them
recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly
historically i have sworn by these though
i like ernie ball strings
i change strings every two weeks
i tried the rest and returned to the best
ive used elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again
this 12 pack was about the same price as 23 packs of elixirs
so far i am very happy with these strings
they sound and feel great
ive been using these strings for many years
quality has always been very consistent
live and in the studio these strings work for everything
i always used another companys strings and avoided ernie ball strings
now i dont know why
this are some great strings
the tone is much bettter too
as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved
i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work
it had been dropped on its head
only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort
these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them
honestly i wont restring my fender with them ill use the fender 250 bullets
but these are great for about any electric
with guitars crappy strings kill it
great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great
used the 942s for years but thought i would give these a try
fuller sound with the 1046s buti cannot bend them like the 9s
i have been using these strings for a while now
they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while
i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars
do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with
are they made with exotic materials
no to all the above
you really cant go wrong with a set of these
made in usa a very good price
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
these strings are good especially for the price
keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag
i have never been let down by ernie ball strings
i only use them and i have been playing for a decade
they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings
this is a pack of guitar strings
it sounds good on my guitar and its not that expensive
i like it4 star rating according to amazon
also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings
ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound
im so proud of my balls
they are tough well made and simply work and sound great
ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time
huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar
good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes
cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel
these are my favorite strings for electric guitar
ive been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago
i play blues jazz and bluesy rock
these strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings
it had been a while since i had some ebs
best packaging i have seen and for the price dont order just one pack
very pleased always have a spare pair in your case
ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings
i really like the mediums
shipping was fast and id definitely recommend these
john mayer and other of my favorite musicians use these strings there great
i could never get the sound i wanted using other manufacturers strings
i tried ernie ball slinkys just for shiggles
there is a rich toney presence to these springs
been using this brand of strings since 1971ive always been pleased
i like the super slinks as well
theyre an industry standard for a reason  you dont need 15 dollar strings
010s but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these
he found just what he needed and at a great price
they last for a real long time
they even include free picks  which is so cool
i defiantly recommend them for everybody else
did i mentioned great value
these have always been my favorite strings and ive just about tried them all
i use this strings with an ibanez rg custom with dimarzios
so im out four bucks oh well
bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings
his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products
heard they were nice strings
but just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet
i put a set on my strat and tele
i will be using this model and brand as long as they make them
for the money you cannot beat these strings
perfect for ibanez guitars with special tuning
ernie ball 2223 super slinky electric strings
like the title says ive been using these for years
i either use the 9s or the 10s and detune them
you can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings
i was a fender or daddario guy and eb ss were beneath me
wow these are some good sounding strings
anyway i ended up keeping the guitar a jackson dk2m
these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles
the 9s are super slinky just like the name says
theyre great for quick movement around the fret board
my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding
good cheap strings for guitar
hard to beat the price
i am not an expert on guitar strings
so i hope that helps
i have an epiphone es339 and recently put these strings on it
oh man do they sound nice
its like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on
still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy
they feel and sound great when you play them
do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings
yes and for good reason
i do like these strings
had a few packs of these from christmas
opened up one recently and the
009 string or 1st string was not in there
my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings
they sound wonderful and cost very little
these are my favorite strings to use on my american strat
they feel great sound great and are extremely cheap
i would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user
buy a pack and try them out
for less than 4 you can see if they work well for you
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings
decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar
other than that they appear ok
these strings honestly arent for rhythm
they bend too easily making rhythm playing impossible
on the plus side for soloing you cant go wrong with these
honestly i would get the hybrid slinkys over these
i had issues with the packaging
i used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets
you have to use all of the strings once opened
ive been using this brand of strings for years
the super slinkys sound great
they last a long time if you wipe down after use
they turned out to be just right
very pleased with the product and price
also i like the first day of new strings look shiny
i would recommend this to any beginner
i have a 5 watt combo amp
i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube
i have a vox ac30hw2x and i put this jj 12ax7 into v1
i have a significant volumegain reduction now
i havent checked yet but id say there is a 4050 loss in volume
i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube
its not stamped to be one so thats why im confused
is it typical of jj to have more headroom
im not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby
btw  12axt and ecc83 are the same tube
i have played full time for over 27 years
popped one of these into my hartke lh500 bass head it it sounds great
i bought these when i had to retube my marshall jcm800 2203kk head
i paired them with the jj kt88s and these things just rock
this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it
its a good quality great sounding tube
these tubes just arent for me
kind of flat and lifeless
one out of 7 arrived doa and another has failed since
most 12ax7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should
but i think the electroharmonix tubes sound better therefore they do
at 12 per shot who cares
rest assured electroharmonix is good stuff and the price is right
needed a pre amp tube for my hartke lh500 and ordered one of these
if that time comes im sure this will be a great tube
wow  they all come to life and make the amp sizzle
the price was right from amz
also i like it more than the jj but the difference is subtle
the preamplifier has one 12ax7
it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time
after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube
he would not send a warranty replacement
my suggestion  new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation
replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue
only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all its tubes and thinking
i am sure i will get more
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier
these cant support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily
they sure are portable though
i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction
over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand
the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing
it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly
it is perfect for what it is
it is adjustable for standing and sitting
holds sheet music as it is intended to do
came with a great little travel bag
folds up and sets up comfortably and easily
the top part is not secured
it just slides on the tip of the tripod
pick it up and carry it around itll come apart and scratch your stradivarius
that means you get one position
and that one doesnt look like it will live very long
comes in a pouch which helps to put it away
spend more if you can
it folds up very nicely
its as good as it looks
with that in mind its perfect
it works greatit keeps my music in order
i am able to see my music
this has been a very useful tool
the angle of the tray is not adjustable
daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money
exactly as described and very affortable
would recommend this to anybody
nice microphone stand for the cost
will purchase an extender to use with it
this is a substantial stable very solidly built stand
should the need arise it is also easy to disassemble and assemble
this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging
even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable
not much i can say about a standard mic stand
unless it was a cheap piece of crap
and as an end user a upc sticker serves nobody
why is it even there
this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it
this is what all distortion pedals are judged by
adds thick creamy distortion enhances harmonics and maintains great attack and definition
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today
and at a great price to boot
this pedal is not new to me
no other distortion pedal can do it as well
it just does it all and well
that might thow a few folks off but its a little thing really
by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little
and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit
flawless comes to mind here
strong as a tiger tank
kinda cool if you ask me
but your tone will still stink
i go with the rat
and its exactly the same
simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain
this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it
though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby
i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it
this proco rat pedal does not use that
2 consistently use and replace batteries
3 find a converter from barrel jack to 35mm jack
4 be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself
other than the above excellent pedal
like a perfect marshall but with more organicness
it really has its own tone i must add
fat thick smooth and saturated
it responds to picking very well and organically
as you move the distortion knob higher the sounds gets more and more animal
the tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound
a nice pedal to have to be sure
its great as a stand alone distortion running on a clean amp
it can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory
it doesnt cut the bass out
its really an excellent pedal
a rat is a rat whether theyre coming from china or the usa
mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark
so i dunno what that other guy was complaining about
as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average
compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard
is it valuable as such
it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that
another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot
not so with this pedal
for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere
i love adding channels to amps and that is exactly what this pedal does
it helped me create a separate fuzzdistortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile
its built to last and solid as a rock
last distortion pedal youll ever need
tried it didnt like it returned it
just not my cup of tone thats all
i have more use for an overdrive
i does the job that i wanted it for
just to keep picks in my guitar case
its okay but it could be better
i love this now i dont have to find my pick
i bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar
i also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend
this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy
bought roughly 5 of these
i like them and my playing buddy likes them
i keep one in each case
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks
it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them
dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players
this product as advertised did not come with any picks
if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately
for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient
love love love the hastlefree access to my picks
thanks guys for the great little product
on stage i prefer microphone boom holders
well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one
my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks
casual part time guitar player here
it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo
it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time
i used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month
unfortunately they sent the wrong one but ill use it anyway
its also not the same size as the one in the photo much wider
finish playing slide your pick into this and its there when you play again
have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar
can hold up to 11 picks of
i use tortex guitar pick of that thickness
i cant write a great review for this
theres nothing to write about
this is a pick holder
i like this so much i bought 4 and going back for more
spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks
i keep one in each guitar case
i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends
fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick
wellconceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks
inexpensive solution and quite handy
this dunlop 5005 pick holder work good
for an in expense product
it is want i need for travel
it is ok but it does not compare to the ergo holder
which you may find here dunlop ergo pickholder
this is a nice pick holder especially for the price
it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use
one note  this does not come with any picks
one customer said it did but mine did not
i even moved it once and it still sticks fine
it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out
love love love this pick holder
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place
easy to reach and nice to have on hand
i bought two more today
i have ordered 6 or 7 or these
this was another filler item for a much larger order
i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track
simple idea but a good one
its a great pick holder but im not fond of the sticky background
something clipon would have been more useful
all three of my kids have a guitar
they were always losing their picks
this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while
i lose picks so easily i needed a pick hold
this one sticks well to the guitar
locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar
unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle
i might try it somewhere on the strap
the double stick tape that came on it has worked well
she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics
i stuck this on her amp so she would not misplace it
doesnt hold as many pick as i expected
looking back cant see why i really need it
a plastic bag does fine
i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag
ive never had these before until recently
the couple more that came in had a wider slot on them
turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well
this picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones
no more misplaced or lost picks
this handy little device will fit perfectly in any outoftheway spot on your instrument
nonmarring adhesive on back wont damage guitar finishes
easy to withdraw and replace picks
i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele
get one of these if you play with a pick
it is easy to use
this is the best cleaning product ive ever used
really brings out the beauty of true wood
application method is also very useful
go ahead and buy it
i use this on all my households guitars and basses
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass
applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets wipes right up
a must to keep wood looking fresh
so far still made in america
ive polished many guitars multiple times
it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings
just one bottle of this should last years and years
i also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents
i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry
its a good finish but not the place to start
the product is not meant to be used on maple
makes the fretboard feel like new but best to clean with alcohol wipes first
restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color
also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle
a great investment thatll last quite a long time
its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle
ive had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years
i used this product and it really soaked it up fast
now it looks beautiful again
very satisfied with how it worked
what more do you want
immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away
its okay to soak the wood as long as its momentary
ive tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best
i highly recommend this product
this will make your fretboard smile
it takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new
continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry
i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones
leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel
i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time
works great  keeps all my fretboards looking great
guess ill have to stop eating cheetos while im playing  just kidding
no issues  no problems only positive things to say about the oil
other than that it is what it is and does what it says
the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards
doesnt say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned
but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio
theres a slight hiss too
but i enjoyed listening to it while playing
and when you attach the headphones it works great
amazine that it works off a 9v battery
yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect
but that costs 2x or more as much
i am in the process of returning it
look at the picture of it next to a coke can
thats what it looks like
some people complained that the handle doesnt work
the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too
but thats sort of what youre getting
not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie
make sure thingie outputs at least500 ma if you can
tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing
all workand the distortion control
mostlly notnecessary for me but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too
even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing
for the price it is worth
this is a cool little amp
i wouldnt perform with it but great for personal use
i m obviously not a 34techie34
i couldnt understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldnt work
until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane  aha
this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes
the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell
truly an amazing little gadget
this unit is well constructed
switches and knobs feel sturdy
the user guide is informative
it has a wide tone range
i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear
you can loop an effects processor thru it
di bass is the worst
after a few performances i let go and left the amp at home
the bass attack pedal did not disappoint
ever since i just bring a bass and this pedal
running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound
i dont miss the amp at all
but once i got it locked in ive never touched the knobs again
i just plug in and everything sounds magical
dont get me wrong the sans amp is still great
the only down side is that it doesnt come with an ac power adapter
this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals
the fun old rock n roll stuff
you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound
the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple
he is another cool use for this pedal
if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp
the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible
awesome unit for the price very happy with it
im using this as a di box for recording
it does some compression overdrive eqing notch eqing and exciteing all in one pedal
this pedal is very versatile
another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power
this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording
you will not be disappointed in this product
the strings came very quickly and are of very good quality
i cant brag on them enough
i am however an electric gitty player primarily
i just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting
i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good
i normally buy daddario strings here
this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning
when i first started on guitar i put
then i went to daddario strings
i wanted to try these since the under 5 price is good
they dont sound as crisp as the daddario strings
they sound more mellow and not as bold
they are 8020 and i prefer those to the other strings out there
i cant say i love them or i hate them
i will probably stick with daddario since i dont find any difference in them
i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon
so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help
i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night
not sure how they will last time will tell
good strings i would recommend them
to all heavy music guitarist i highly recommend this one
try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star
i love these strings they never stop amazing me
i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars
for the price they are awesome strings
these perform well on single coils specifically telecasters
however these power slinky strings are great
ive not broken one yet and the 1148 is a good gauge
heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played
i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it
i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays
tuned them once no breaking in
they also sound good with any settings i use
i bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son
he says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality
i purchase these strings a lot for my son
you cant beat the price for these quality guitar strings
theyre made in the usa
the string are easy to play and sound great
there is a reason they are used by so many professionals
the are strong durable and sound good
these hold up well taking a good bend and beating
5 stars for what they are
i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them
they are used by other artists that approve of them
slash from guns n roses uses them
ive used ernie balls slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades
they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great
lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound
the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm
if you need an overall great set of strings get these
got no complaints over these
very smooth and lasted me a while
these sound good on my electrics
the best sound i got was on my lp
good sustain and strings are staying in tune well
installed with no problems plays pretty well so far
after using daddario strings ive try to ernie ball strings
these strings are different and really quite nice
the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend
the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings
that should make me about 58
well they werent very close anyway
since then ive been through a multitude of guitars and strings
i finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through amazon
ive owned strats telecasters cheapies an alvarez i think
strings  the ones that came on there sounded great
i didnt put it down for a couple of weeks
sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics
i finally got the best out of that set of strings
i always use ernie ball on everything
theyve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house
i saw some hybrids on amazon and had never heard of them
i put the hybrids on the new les paul
they made it sound even better than it was
the high strings will talk to you
i can bend the gstring easier than a super slinky
this is the only guitar ive used them on but they sound great
i imagine ill stick with them for this machine from now on
of course amazon is always 5 stars in my book
i lke these strings very much
they bend quite a bit and are very easy to use
however they tend to come untuned because theyre so susceptible to temperature and humidity
nothing too spectacular about them
042 on the low e which is just too small for good twangy bass
ive always used ernie ball strings
ive tried others   always go back to ernie balls
they sound  feel great
the only strings i get are ernie ball strings
really reliable great sound got no complaints here really
as a spare cable to play at home though its pretty good
dont buy the high rated chrome capped ones i had problems with those
this one is good just that i regret paying so much for it
it appears to be well made and durable
there is no noise or hum
it works and i like
i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a 6 practice cable
i can honestly tell a difference
monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price
its flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable
its much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables
for the money its really hard to beat
i wont waste money on the more expensive cables again
however at amazons current value price for this particular monster cable its a nobrainer
its made by monster cable
this cable works fine im going to buy a pair in january 2013
i used it live and they are really great durable and it feels pro
great cable for patching in and rocking out
it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well
excellent price and product is as described and price was right
this string set offers typical daddario quality and value
i use daddario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle
i prefer shars overture premieres which are the same price
daddario prelude violin string set 44 scale medium tension is good deal for beginners
its good enough not expensive
try it till you ready to by more expensive string
these are a good value for quality strings
strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in
they are durable and have a nice tone
im an abhorrent violinist but i teach mariachi band to elementary school students
on my el cheapo violin these strings sound quite nice
i still pull one of these out every once in awhile
im glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them
my fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought
they work well on bass and acoustic however
i purchased these to use with my mandolin
i am a converted guitar player and i like playing with a pick
i like that sharp thwack sound
but the tone can be a little harsh so i got these
for me they were a waste of money
they make the notes sound like bells
i am liking these more and more as time goes by
original reviewrecently i got the itch to try different unique picks
these the dunlop primetones felt picks metal picks etc
i get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks
they perform quietly and give a more mellow tone
probably wont be a daily driver but interesting none the less
not my style but they work ok
thought i would give them a try
even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dustshedding they do
the wedgie is exactly what ive been looking for
i tried the soft and medium wedgies but both were just too soft
but the hard wedgie is the clear winner
the only negatives ive found are 1
they can leave skid marks on your pick guard
no big deal as it wipes right off
they break down faster than id like
of course that could just be my expectations
still if youre looking a softerthanplastic pick this is the one to get
no pick noise just strings
they felt exactly the same in fact
the medium was the hardest out of the bunch
so check with what you get
i purchased these picks because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band
i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise
they dont make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible
i need to have alot of pick speed
these slow me down way to much
too bad as i had high hopes
and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway
this is a fun pick
i love the tone of this pick striking strings
i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings
more organic than plastic picks
yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard
ive tried all 3 types of these and theyre pretty much asadvertised
to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic
it doesnt sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine
i wouldnt want it to be my everyday acoustic tone though
but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable
much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up
the only negative is the way they seem to be packed here
they come in three colors and the colors stand for soft medium hard
i never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag
my verdict   go with medium or hard version
first time for a  soft wedgie
pick that is i did have an older brother
i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great
very good price and looks like they will last awhile
as such i found them to be a reasonable value
however im not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic
i love the very soft warm sound they provide
not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords
back to the drawing board i go
but i havent dented anything yet so perhaps im just too skeptical
its getting the job done and i havent seen a better option
all in all a pretty good device
see my customersupplied photos at the top of the page for examples
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
again it works perfectly for my situations
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
very stable clamp mechanism works very well
nice to have in your gadget bag
nice and stable  no issues  works perfectly
i tried it for ipad
it kinda wobbles up and down
i only recommend it for something light weight
theres better ones out there
see my review on the music stand
that comes with a solid extension arm
i bought it without hesitation
once hooked up i was very surprised how flimsy it is
i have a 13 gooseneck a light condenser mic and small shockmount on it
obviously any small bump into the stand will once again set this off
you will be far far happier
these things grab the mic and wont let go
they are worth the extra cost
buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping
sturdy mic clip on a budget
mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence
will purchase more as needed
it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add
much better than a standard clip on a mic
if it does break has a lifetime warranty
moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise
cant ask for more than that
ive had many mic holders and this one is by far the very best
it does it all and is tougher than nails
so i had to order a clip later
nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks
it is a nice clip works for my mics
i dont like the soft opening
it makes you not easy to put back the mics
the mount has exceeded my expectations
all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase
it is exactly as represented
it does a fine job
i have used it in recording live band practice sessions
i would if necessary purchase this item again
you cant have too many adapters if you are a sound guy
i didnt need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed
does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units ive used
these plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for
if i buy more in the future i will be checking here first
took a while to find what i needed but this is what i needed
exactly what i needed at a great price
i notice mixed reviews here
seems to me as good as any connector ive ever bought
these have worked great when ive needed to have 14 input vs the xlr
especially when i bust out the old tascam 4 track cassette
this works just as stated
whats not to  love inexpensive and does its job
only thing i found was that  the pin rockrd a bit
not much of a chore
anyway that is the view from where i sit
youll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter
it seemed to work very well in this role
it was wellconstructed with all the connecting points working precisely and securely
anyone who works with pa and sound equipment needs these adapters
for this price you cant beat the item
ive had no problems with the ones ive bought
i see mixed reviews here
mine seems to be fine doesnt look or feel flimsy at all
and they produce no audible hum into the circuit
this is a perfect compliment to my current set up
this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly
a great buy as the price was perfect as well
i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second
this item really speaks for itself
it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop
the base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy
but that is honestly to be expected
this stand works fine if you dont need a shock mount
not a huge deal if youre using a standard mic clip
i have two of these now and they may be my favorite
had another brand that stopped working and replaced with this
the other one was not bad i lasted probably 10 years
this pedal is outstanding for the price
chrome is great quality and it has good weight so its not tinny
listen to the voice of experience grrr
at least the previous 2 i bought did
so is that like 20 hail marys for that confession
its an amazing tool for keyboard player
fist off guitar center had this for 29 bucks
that said the pedal is great
ive used this pedal with a casio px200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now
pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards
its a tipnegative polarity and the privia requires a tippositive polarity
so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed
cord is long enough 6con build quality is slightly less than the fc4
some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking
wonderful piano feel piano action
this is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three
i am a future m audio customer from here on
this pedal is very nice
it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great
you can just plug it into your keyboard and play
i had to send my first one back
the second one is working fine so far
ive noticed it works better with some daws than others also
if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software
it works great with reaper
just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection
i would buy it again
i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway
it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open
it also worked perfectly on my roland rd300nx but i expected that
plus the price is right
if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it
not complaints just works and is reasonably priced
with the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedaling
this pedal works like a charm
stays in place and works as de
i bought 2 of these as controllers for my alesis drum machine
an allaround solid purchase for the low price i found on amazon
i thought i could take the smell
otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding
i tried airing it out for a week with no success
if you have no sense of smell get one
this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested
great portability for the price
i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smellfree case
and they sent a case
its a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars
dont expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you wont be disappointed
that said i find it useful for composing on the road
nice sturdy and portable case
action is adequate for practicewith a little tweaking its actually good
quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors
i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made
the sound is kind of acoustic guitarukulele banjo ish
plays great to the top fret
unbelievable instrument a pleasure play
oh and the case is a 40 freebee  buy one be happy
this is a great size
this guitar is just for you to practice scales practice a tune
you wont be performing with this guitar
we got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar
it seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it
other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap
we did notice a scent but it didnt bother anyone
a more odorsensitive person might feel differently
i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan
i am more than please with what i have received
the case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets
best buy i have made on a product i couldnt try out first
also was the last to pick it up for 11850 shipped to my door
if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you
the case is kick ass too easily a 50 value
this is my goto guitar
sounds good and has great intonation
really nice looking and heavy duty
its soft without being limp
theres no breakin time required
i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great
this guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather
i am very happy with it and thank you
i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great
the texture almost looks fake though
i very much recommend it along with some dunlop straploks
i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar
if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap
reviews described strap as 34soft34 and 34weathered34 which sounded good to me
actual description is a blasted 34design34 which is what you get
strap is quite stiff but id say its worth the price
i would have preferred something different
this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap
its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for
its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades
im not sure how you would wear it out really
pretty standard vs all other straps
i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural
i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it
i started getting nice compliments about the guitar
thought the guitar is beautiful ive had it for a while
i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar
ive been recording professionally for 27 years music radio commercials and television mostly
so ill try to give you the information you need to make your purchase
but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong
this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best
i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option
it doesnt come with the cord what a surprise
it doesnt come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like
for desktop users heres what id do
82 wouldnt have bought a case for most of my condensers
it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics
so when reviewers say its bright i say compared to what
i can tell you what it sounds like
a great sound in audio recording
have you heard good 70s recordings
tutsplus dot comtutorialsbeginnersguidetoacoustictreatmentaudio1274 just replace the dot
this model is the lowest priced but youre buying a reputable brand
this model is not usb
accurate or inaccurate not good or bad theres a difference
if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out
this mike is a great way to start recording at home
great price for good mike
i did not want to spend a lot to start
at2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality
microphone is quite good for such price
the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones
recommend for small budget studios
whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true
but it sounds great when your recording songs
i record with fl studio and its even great so far
i recommend you get this
nice mic to record acoustical instruments
word word word word word word word word word word
my old mic just wasnt cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface
there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles
it is recording my guitar beautifully
i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean
ill probably get another one
i kind of wish id have bought that combo kit
second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser
works exceedingly well for any use
whether dubbing audio recording instruments or just yelling at the top of your lungs
no issues and pretty sure i will never have any
i use these on a deering goodtime ii and they work well
good strings and not overly prone to corrosion
i bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo
strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel
one person may love them the next may not
all strings must be kept clean if you want them to last
wipe each string when done and they will last longer
easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at least
not much else to say about strings  p
each string is labeled so you know which goes where
im a beginner and can change my own strings so im proud of myself
strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with
these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well
even if youre starting out you should tell the difference right away
works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten
its ok but not the best fog machine out there
great device and good price
my wife made me try this for a gig we had
the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though
i will report on that
it does what it should do
this beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job
its best on a stand 34 feet off the ground
overall build quality is very nice
metal case compact nice bracket lighted remote telling you when its ready
leaks a bit while using  so dont stand under it
but most on these things leak anyway
great for videophoto work or even theater
it wont handle well at a large space
if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation
this is a really nice product for the price
otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel
good quality and doesnt cost very much
the price is great too
has a black finish on it
this does the trick just fine
it is light sort of cheap etc
the price was right so i got one
does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music
this is a great music stand
i was surprised at the good quality for such a little price
it does exactly what i needed it for
i use it and my granddaughter uses it as well
it is sturdy easy to fold away and easy to setup
the leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand
except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels
not sure what thats about
the material its made of is good and it holds the guitar
the only things i dont like are 21each of the corners has a cap
the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off
i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one
this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use
i dont have any problem with this stand at all
it should not be a problem to you or your guitar
construction is fine and you can set it up in 30 seconds
i dont know why some people hate it
for under 10 and prime eligible what more can you ask for
i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money
a good price a good buy
glad i invested in it
i just wonder what other people have encountered
in life you mostly get what you pay for
this stand really isnt an exception
this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it
for 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar
it does what its supposed to
a great price and a good item
its really hard to beat this product for the price
i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar
forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand
doubt ill use the strap
but then again i probably will try  to use it that way
i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall
not worth the purchase in my opinion
better than i expect i going to order 2 more
very stable easy to assemble  and a nice price
not perfect but a solid stand
good because itll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles
tubulaarrrrholds my 8 string 6 string acoustic etc
and works well for it
i dont know how long it will last
i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole
but the price is right and the stand is solid enough
all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last
bought stand as a gift for my sons acoustic guitar
he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand
cant go wrong for the price
they work great were easy to assemble and not expensive
great deal for the very low price
a lil glue will fix it just havent had time
still a great product its just a little flimsy
the way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem
i purchased this for my sons acoustic guitar
great value for the money
no assembly instructions were included in the packaging
ive never owned something like this before so that was annoying
it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish
not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still
these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well
we are just playing for the love of it
same basic materials you cant go wrong with either
see my other review for the world tour gs1 folding tripod guitar stand
honestly i cant tell them apart since i threw out the boxes
not the cheapest but worth the money
i own several and have had no trouble with them
buy it and you will see
they shipped quickly and didnt break the bank
for the price you cannot go wrong with this
holds my les paul and feels secure
ive never had any issues with this
i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain
i have several stands and this is the second one of these i bought
it works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar
seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt
between 7 and 13 earns it 4 stars
if it were under 7 it would have gotten 5 stars
i hope this helpsjps  the currency is in us dollars
i paid 10 dollars for this
i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items
once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product
it holds your guitar up
got what i paid for
sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can
i have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable
my acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand
the neck strap and the base are excellent
look at the other reviews and you wont be disappointed
it didnt smell like the other reviews said either
you get what you pay for
this is a nononsense cheap guitar stand
this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar
you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those
what a great price and product
it is solid but light weight enought to move as needed
the footprint is small  meets are needs well
this stand is very stable and easy to put together
works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item
if it doesnt work you hate it
if it works theres nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it
this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great
love the all black look as well
ive 34first act34 brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed
for a ten spot ya cant do better
matte flat black finish is nice
great durable foam contact points for cradling baby
double dog dare ya to do better
this is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars
ive picked up a few of these for my various guitars
my big nose cant confirm that
maybe they corrected the problem if one exited
cant b beat for the cost
it does jusy exactly whats expected
ive had no problem with this guitar stand
i recommend it as a well functioning stand at a very economical price
i like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out
while it is just a stand it seems to be sturdy and durable
i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine
it hasnt seen heavy use
at least thats what she told the police
this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musicians gear stand
they might actually be the same stand under different names
the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping
that gives this stand more value
the stand is very easy to set up
this took a little getting used to but it does work very well
the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well
extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems
i have been buying these stands for years and will continue to do so
they do what theyre built for and are as described
i really like this stand
it has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders
i highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars
this stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well
its a very fair price and is made well
it seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around
id recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure its secure
im not sure how 34on stage34 ready this is
have not gigged with it as yet
so no comments as to its toughness
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part
i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option
it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it
of coursei could not recommend this product to anyone
holds my guitars just fine
not for guitars with nitro finish
the result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars
its sturdy and very portable
the two things i was looking for
cant really compare to the others but for me worth the price
i didnt have one at all and this workgs great
delivered in a timely manner
believe it or not ive been putting off buying one
i have just receive mine just now
i never thought that it would be so solid
it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge
i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand
for 10 bucks this is great very sturdy and reliable
works wit all my guitars and for the price it is a steal
i use these on my hofner and gibson es135
they sound amazing and feel fantastic
purchased these for a new heritage h575 arch top
a few months later the high e string unwound from the ball end
overall good strings good sound  this set simply didnt last very long
i will replace with 12s however
for me the 11s felt a little loose
the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box
i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model
ill be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s
awesome feel sound and price
they do take some time getting used to
this is good but it takes some getting used to
with these i found myself overshifting both high and low
its all the same no squeak slick jazzer mellow in tone
its a sound that many would like to acheive
but why not round wounds
okay but i have a pickup want the mellower tone sans finger noise
its important for my playing to not have finger noise
not ready to take the plunge
it is a different feel if not try half rounds
output is not a problem if you are amplified
a very 34different34 sound range than round wounds
in fact its about time to order another set or three
some electric bassists still do this
i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from
009s might be intimidated by
flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action
they dont vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they dont need as much clearance
rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the daddario flatwound
almost the same sound as the pyramids and a lot cheaper
i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel
these strings are what i needed and they perform
no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric archtop
smooth but not dull sounding
will defiantly be buying more
have these on my tele very interesting to play around with
these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys
as far as cq goes these are great no problems feel great sound great
does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it
the handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles
over all a nice product
no fuss no muss no fooling around
never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers
after each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers
this brush is sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest and thorens
the brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission
after that your record will sound brand new again
just try not to get the labels wet
this is everything you need in a record brush
i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor
the strap wouldnt hold my guitar any longer
so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly
very simple and works very well
i have not used any lock system thats perfect
every one that ive used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly
also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends
the strap locks do work
but they are kind of a pain
it feels safe and secure
does not work for all guitars
wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger
also i read a review bout it not fitting some guys lp
well obviously that depends on the strap
im using this with an ovation balladeer
with these strap loks the strap never comes off
ive had it on for 2 and a half months now with no problems
they are plastic and will wear out someday ill buy another pair then
ive read where people are using bottle caps instead of these
i mean you pay for a quality instrument right
why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe
im sorry but thats just idiocy in action
this isnt 1960 get an upgrade already
i play standing up 95 of the time so these are a necessity
thats something that should only happen once in your life if at all
the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones
low cost strap lock that works on most guitars buttons
it comes two in a package
this design works best for me
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks
i recommend the 7000 model
the 7000 model does the same and doesnt take as much space
this is true for either one of the models
i bought him a set of these
this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair
that is not the case
its called train your people
eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasnt expensive
ive had them for 23 months now and they havent failed me yet
not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints
hard to believe this was so bad
go with the planet waves lock straps
it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do
ive turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy
this is a great effect
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
this is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
these are easy to install using the instructions or without
these are also sturdy and look very good
i installed these pins in my silvertone sd10
if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins
for the cost you cant beat it
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs
this should improve my sustain and tone even more
if youre looking for a budget increase of tone
this is a way to go
the pins measure  28mm or 1 14 inches in length
i can tell a slight difference
if you havent changed your saddle
do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one
steel strings only  does not apply to nylon or gut strings
then again they might make all the difference in the world
you just have to try them and see
they are inexpensive and pretty
these are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were
i ordered three of these
very affordable and good quality
keeps wireless unit very snug and tight
easy in and out with velcro retaining strap
the leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit
way too small maybe like a third of the width
i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit
however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely
so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something
but you need to attach it with something
i never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor
most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries
this is very ruggedly made i think it will last for ever
this came in the mail today in a rather large box
it is not bad but i dont think i would purchase another one
i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet
holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight
almost annoyingly hard to get one out
holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless
it is also just great to 34hang34 on the headstock went not in use
now that ive learned how best to use it ill keep it
they snap and go airborn which is dangerous
i use this on my takamine and my tele
you can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it
cheaper ones will work but i wanted to try it out
for everyone else look elsewhere
i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this
i thought they were crazy
i broke down and im glad i did
only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly
i use mine on a martin hd28 and have had no problems whatsoever
a great move toward a new generation of capos
not cheap  but worth every cent
once you get the hang of this capo its wonderful
it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension
its pretty accurate on that neck up to the 4th fret
now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it
this capo is expensive but i have never found one that works so well
it is worth the money in my opinion
ive tried kyser capos and theyre good
this capo however just works simply smoothly and its a great pleasure to operate
did it improve my life
the first time i and everybody else saw one i said wow
i can get a kyser or something for fifteen bucks
yes it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants
i own three shubbs a kyser a dunlop and one of those rolling capos
i dont hate any of them
it makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy
today i had one of those finds
im not kidding  it was one of those finds
all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared
i love the selfratcheting feature of the g7th
others have commented on the cost of this capo
the g7th performance capo is priceless
cant say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design
love it and have one in every case
probably the best capo i have ever had
its easy to put on and holds the strings well
it is easy to use
and holds all strings down completely and easily
the g7th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose
im a beginner and i try to learn to play guitar
i had always had some issues with it but it was liveable
the real problem began when i switched to different strings silk and steels
duh i should have thought about this it makes perfect sense in retrospect
one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired
so he mentioned this capo and i immediately chortled
thats how much he payed
then he grabbed his g7 from the car and let me try it
the strings stayed in tune
i ordered one the next day
the intonation issues are greatly reduced and i am thrilled
we bought the pylepro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma230
overall a good value for the low cost of this unit
the unit does what it was meant to do
i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system
the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about
ill probably be returning this unit asap
note its vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference
i also wish it was an xlr connection
for general use in doors its decent and for sure worth the price
for the price its amazing
i just hope it works in the field as well
i bought this becausehey a wireless mic for 13
the audio is always clipped
dont even think of using this for music
certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it
we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost
our tips  cd sales have gone way up
but in our case it works beautifully
recommended just remember the price point and you wont be disappointed
i love this mic as an indoor studio mic
but when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic rocks
clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well
good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano
comes with a db limiter 16dbswitch right on the mic
works really nicely at limiting background noise
i would highly recommend this especially at the price
comes with a decent hard case and sweet shock mount
quality and price im just satisfied
best sounding vocal mike for the bucks
unfortunately the top end isnt as defined as a at2035 or nt1a
so i ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter
i was previously using a blue usb snowball
this just sounds so much fuller and more real
top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon
for years ive owned a nice at4033
but didnt have the cash for another at4033 or similar
who says you cant afford the good stuff these days
keep it up technology gurus
the sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing
clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer
this mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our studios here at
tune in and check it out i think you will agree
this mic has amazing quality
i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about 2 years
feels great to finally have professional sounding music
check out my soundcloud  soundcloudcomljaymusic
this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price
ill definitely be buying more of these
we bought this rack tray for our sons new sound rack
it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet
best price and overall value compared to the name brands
this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more
did a ton of research out there b4 i bought this
what a racket it is
if i could make one i would
this one was cheap and does the job
good luck and good music to all
its heavy enough that it doesnt flex unnecessarily
i like it enough that i bought another one
very good tray to put small items
i put my kvm switch on it and other server components
these tuning machines are great
the tuner hole size is
it is only one hole and very small
the run around at the post office of getting it resent was ridiculous
these things are heavy duty and thick
the stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things
i placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer
stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock ping tuners
this is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed
so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes
i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc
this is a standard 3824 threading tap
at least i dont want to
now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune
best tuners you can buy
bought these to replace some gold ones on a les paul clone
i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas
took me about 15 hours
the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance
really close but they were terrible in operation
i have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar
havent played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes
update   played for a couple hours
you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly
which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment
this fixed the chibson tuning issue
ill order another set for my other chibson
also i have two epiphones
i believe these are nicer than the epis
so i bought based solely on the reviews here
in fact i am pretty impressed
good replacement for iffy tuners
this works better than the qk10b model by the same company
slim and easy to install though longer than the qk10b
to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts
my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand
this looks to be well built and should be reliable
the long haul will be the test
this is just what the doctor ordered
i bought three and am purchasing 3 more
all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders
the time it saves is also invaluable
thats a total of 12
these will save you time guaranteed
i swear by these quick release clips
i cant imagine working without them
they work great every time
these great little accessories are a nice convenience
bought 6 to replace to older models i had on stage
its a very solidly made stand
perfect for my home studio holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard
im very happy with the purchase and the price was right
im using it for my alesis q49 midi keyboard
folds up easy so i can tuck it away
it may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys
as you lower it the support spreads out wide
adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard
great stand holds my mid sized keyboard up very well
this works exactly as intended and is a perfect size for my ms2000
this keyboard is pretty dope
its been a little over 2 years and ive used it ever since
i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently
you cant go wrong with this stand
colors are abit too flashy
definitely glad i bought this
this strap looks better in person than on the computer
great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price
just restrung my 12 string
it was a hassle but i got it done nicely
of course guitar strings can be a personal preference
this does not mean i will not try others
i surely will continue to experiment
i  find the daddario strings will stay in better condition than others
i have them on my luna 12 string and the sound is rich
i would purchase them again
put these on my prs se 245 and i love em
i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2
they were a perfect fit
i have purchased two sets of the mini locking rotomatics
no more winding string wraps around the tuning post
no more slipping out of tune
rotomatics will go on every guitar build i do
smooth as silk work great  as all grovers do
these really are direct replacements for the prs se line
only the machine heads are somewhat smaller
they call these mini tuners but to me they are just right
some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho
i installed them on a prs se santana in just a few minutes
they were direct drop ins
to use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks
used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr
much better sound perfect fit etc
i believe it has those
using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp
im quite pleased with this speaker
i built a custom cabinet and installed this baby
ive tried a couple different heads and they all sound great
i play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine
this speaker has a very clear full range sound
i have it in a 63 brown deluxe and am very good with it
cool speaker and nice addition
the original speakers are too hifi sounding for me
they hurt my ears so clean
right now i have the cr and one original speaker running in my tr
ill get another cr if this one holds up okay
ill post an update if this speaker fails
but at least on an initial run im glad i bought it
its also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db1w1m
i dont know how eminence did it but i love it
i havent regretted the purchase
it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for
all in all it was a good upgrade and id do it again
dont listen to the whiners
these are what they need to be
ive had several sets for 13 years and use them without hesitation
these are the only locks ill use now
im never playing another guitar without these locks
after my custom telecaster fell
i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps
i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use
one issue you may run into is the nut running loose
a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily
these are a musthave item
heretofore ive been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism
these schallers are exactly what i wanted
5 stars and a nobrainer
also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use
i had never used strap locks before and dont think i will again
i bought these black locks to go on a black stratocaster i built
new straps seem to be easier to secure
my larrivee rs4 came with these and converted me to schaller
their are two issues with these straplocks that i have come across
the first issue is with thick straps
overall it wasnt a huge issue just a bit annoying
the second issue is actually a very concerning to me
i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy
its the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument
ieutf8qid1357264576sr81keywordsstraplockwhich seem a lot better and more sturdy
schaller guitar strap locks work really really well
however i had problems at first until i made some changes
the blue stuff will be more than enough
never had one unscrew again
schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place
they have been around a long time and hold up well with time
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
ive been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the 1980s
i consider it cheap insurance
the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these
the locks work great and give you an added sense of security
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
they worked well and were easy to install
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
this made me take a second look at schaller
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
this is my second set of these
i have found that everything schaller makes is grade a1 in my book
made in germany  not china  these locks are fast and secure
no dropping guitars around here
i have them on all my guitars
this is as simple and as reliable as it gets
you dont need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt
you probably already know what this thing is and what it does
all my electric guitars are equipped with these
certainly worth every penny you pay for them
and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer
these are great for sure
i will stick with the schaller in all 3 colors
on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series
you dont care about a telescoping boom and2
you dont plan to adjust it much and3
you use a average weight mic or4
so i hope all of this helps you with your decision
this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up
can be used either sitting or standing
it is lightweight but is still sturdy
i wouldnt venture to use it on the road all the time
but as a backup stand i wouldnt hesitate
that being said its a great little stand for low dutyhome use
and for less than 25 bucks its a bargain
legs open to set up easy
easy to set mic slides in or out up or down
i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good
the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced
the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust
it is built like a baton
the arm is adjustable and long
i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm
it can hold quite a bit of weight
the adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees
i love this microphone stand
it stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall
very high quality microphone stand
for the price this is a good value
works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg
quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence
its perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use
for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine
good quality for my casual use
i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic
great quality and i would definitely buy them again
ive been buying cheap stands and im never really getting what i want
almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials
can double as a mic or boom stand
if not just invest about 6 into an adapter like i did
it also folds down pretty well
the cable clips are a nice touch
for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules
very good stand especially for the price
these are exactly what the doctored ordered
they are excellent quality for the money
this is a nice microphone stand
i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems
i would purchase this again
its sturdy and gets the job done
screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use
the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear
it is what it is and not much more
does exactly what you want it to do
it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand
its easy to set up and easy to take down
i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy
we have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive
i believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand
i go through these quite a bot but for 2030 you cant go wrong
this seems like a good deal for the price
this stands up and holds the microphone in place
the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use
the only place is on the box after you have received the item
theres no instruction which is fine
the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip
but without it i felt cheated
cant really beat it for the price
i am totally satisfied with the stand
i easily reommend this item
i needed a cheap mic stand that didnt break the bank
this little guy fit the bill
it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced
versatile and great to work with
this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand
only thing make sure you read the description well
it is a euro stand so it has 5827 threads
it does not come with a mic clip
i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some
overall i would buy again
and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own
not so good outside if there is a fair breeze
had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented
for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat
there are better deals for just slightly more money
i use this for my home recording studio
this stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle
from playing and singing piano recording guitar and vocals and other various positions
it makes my recording convenient
the adjustable parts are easy to use
got this stand to mount a studio projects c1 condenser mic
the stand is very stable and works well
it is very reasonably priced as well
its well built enough to stand up to regular use
i use mine for recording and some performance
currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount
when fully extended the arm cant hold the entire weight of the shockmountyeti microphone
not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine
all adjustments keep position well
about as sturdy as a tripod can be
exactly as advertised no complaints from this user
good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length
i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic
its heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo
i would much prefer a round base
provides everything i need from a mic stand
everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm
it is after all a cheap chinese stand
awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone
i cant play real guitars
but i did buy this for rock band
i even use it when im drumming
i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players
oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
just put in a 9v battery and it works right away
three knobs to control tone level and distortion to get that perfect sound
look at the price because this thing really sounds good
its no toy its a real retro electric guitar effects pedal
this pedal works great and doesnt slide at all
the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need
i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile
for the price these pedals are outstanding
but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
great little pedal economical and worked flawlessly
besides batteries arent that expensive
cranked out a nice distortion for my fender guitar
warm distortion and good controls
for me great studiorecording use but thats it
i would certainly not tour with it
metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must
but anyways bottom line great unit for 2000 and sounds good very versatile
i found it right here it  works well with no problems to report
next week ill purchase another with a different feature
it also arrived super fast
this delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion but a nice bit of fuzz
im impressed with what you get for the price
true bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are good
but heres my issue the distortion is not crunchy
it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional
it has no depth to it
i ended up switching to a vintagetube overdrive by behringer
not for me maybe for you
it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger
still id rather stick with a copper slide
i purchased this as my first guitar slide
i would not suggest this to anyone
theres a reason all pros use metal
the review below is wrong
slides are meant to cover your entire finger all the way to the tip
you dont bend your finger to play slide
you retune your guitar to an open tuning
just thought i would point that out
my finger stays too tight
not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out
clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio
great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics
i now only use metal slides
this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear
the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths
price was good for a useful accessory
great price and should last long enough
this strap is value for money
the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo
goes well with my black squier strat
no sign of wear and tear
this was my first strap
you cant beat the price either
they dont cost a lot and they work well
they are inexpensive and they work
great cord for the money
works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas
i highly recommend planet waves cables
i have them for my guitars and for my mics
awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life
this with my behringer xm8500 is perfect
i didnt remember where id gotten it or even the manufacturer
i highly recommend this cable
just slightly heavier feel but much more tone
they work and sound good
i didnt notice much of a difference between these and runofthemill daddario strings
they bendnicely and sustain just as well
i recently went electric again after 20 years
so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again
i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems
i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else
maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on it
different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above
i just got done stringing them and they sound great
i think these will be what i play from now on
i didnt know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps
i was origianlly disappointed in the sound
havent had a problem until now
very durable and not uncomfortable either
really awesome item for any type of electric guitar
i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good
works and it is good
no problem very standard one
well you get what you pay for  leather looking paper wouldnt hold guitar
ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly
so this one works well for the price
the strap is strong and well made
i like it a lot
arrived on time and as described
it is basic and not fancy
it does the job is comfortable and the price is right
this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea
so far forget to use it but that will come
a strap is a strap what can you really say about it
it was about 5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine
its comfortable and fits my bass well
im a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it
i have a collection of straps but not a black one
this one matches the acousticelectric i bought perfectly
i would buy fromthis company again
its adjustable with a pick pocket simple good quality would by another
bought this strap for use with my dean evo electric
it works great though and for the price its wonderful
i really like the idea of a 34pick34 pocket in the strap
in fact i like it so well
money well spent on this one for sure
its too stiff not comfortable at all
save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar
they are expensive but worth it
i choose this one because it was very durable
the nylon is very strong i do not see it fraying in the future
my son was very happy with this guitar strap
this works perfect with the quick release system i also purchased
good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones
if i want better i would shop around and pay more
does the job for now
very pleasantly surprised buy this one
i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put
it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well
a nice strap for my lower tier guitars
this is a very secure and almost comfortable
the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy
also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning
simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end
not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a 90 guitar
arrived before projected delivery date
the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use
takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar
overall great buy for a cheap little money saver
if you need a simple normallength strap this should work fine
i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball 4037 black polypro strapinstead
very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer
the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist
best strap available for the price
excellent quality and is very comfy
nice strap for the price
looks nice and quality seems nice
like the pic holder on front
well executed black guitar strap
the length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children
nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively
i ordered with my new guitar
hangs my guitar around my neck so i dont have to hold it there
the pick pocket is handy
i think this is a good deal
this guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck
also the 34pick pocket34 is only useful when the strap is around your neck
when you remove the strap any picks in the pocket fall out
it is ok definitely not great
just well made and functional
i got this for my grandsons squier by fender 34 size acoustic
it doesnt have a strap button at the top end
not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand
they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily
again this material seems to be nonmarring
all this and a secret compartment for picks
overall a fantastic product with a price that cant be beat
this is a nice strap
its kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because its stiff
this strap is a great strap
i have not used the pick holder yet
very nice quality inexpensive guitar strap
a little tough to get on
using this on my ibanez art100 electric guitar
the pick pocket is a nice extra
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely
especially when you take off the guitar for a break
and the price is right
it holds up the guitar
using it on an acoustic dreadnought and its plenty long enough
great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly 6 or more picks
but good product and price
made of durable nylon with pick pocket
given 5 stars shipped on time and at good price
what can i say about a guitar strap
it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price
im not going to gush over this one
it simply works well for the price paid
you do use them right
i like it and will use it again
a great add on to my student model for acoustic practising
always add those rubber gasket strap stops too
fender makes good cheap ones
guitar will never fall off a strap
the soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish
heavy duty but soft on the shoulder
not cheap quality at all
this will definitely last a long time
keep a couple of these in the bag as spares
i have enjoyed my protec strap
having the pick pocket is a neat feature
the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job
recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar
dont forget to buy strap locks you will need it
these are really well made straps for the money
a little nicer than i thought it would be
as far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it
i like the pick pocket too
but dont let the pocket be the selling point
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic
the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar
i would recommend this strap to all
i order 2 of these for my electric guitars
they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range
the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off
these are not coming off anytime soon
this is my second one for my other guitar
pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments
the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about 18 inch
these straps are very good at a low cost
this strap is very well made
very happy with this low cost strap
looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks
the pick pocket is cool though i wont be using it
for the price u cant go wrong
it got here fast and was trackable
slap and tap an dont forget ur strap
i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar
but all in all i will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort
it looks and feels great on my luna butterfly
and i like the durability it seems like it will have
pretty great strap overall and i am very very much pleased with my purchase
is comfortable as this type of strap can be
i ended up switching to their padded strap
nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern
so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least
it is a very nice strap and will last years
buy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny
i really like this strap
bought as a gift for my son and hes very pleased with it
its a guitar strap it does the job and looks good
and 20 for a levys leather strap is a good deal
i got the gold and its goodlooking without being garish
i love my levys jacquard straps
i have purchase 2 to see how they were
they tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders
i just ordered three different guitar straps online
one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself
then i found this and decided to get it
the 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff
i got this and switched over
ahhh this is a guitar strap
i see why you pay more
it is so soft and comfortable
this is just a great product
this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling
the picture does not do it justice
i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal
i am very impressed with how nice this strap is
this one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some ive tried
its fairy thick and the material doesnt slip around on your shoulder easily
aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful
the photo cannot do it justice
im very pleased with the product and the price
i have several of these straps in different colors and ive never been disappointed
if you like the design go for it
the design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud
this levys jacquard strap is well made and comfortable
arrived quite quickly but a tracking number wouldve been nice
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ x2
i immediately noticed a difference in the quality fullness and volume of my amp
an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ xd
i immediately noticed a difference in the warmth articulation and fullness of my sound
the cleans are warm and
clean and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely
i always thought i was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned
tried the same lick with the ragin cajun and it sounds perfect
all speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot
with that said this thing sounds amazing directly after install
fabulous clean tone and great distortion sound running off a solidstate amp and pedals
the characteristic strat sound of my guitar is very apparent
weighs a ton cool logo made in usa
what more could you ask
i installed this in a super champ x2
thats because its designed for making solos stand out
if youre a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing
however if you mostly play rhythm id stick with the stock speaker
pop one of these in
my little  vht special 6 came alive with this speaker
simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp
gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer
wouldnt even think twice about it
i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x2 champ
it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet
it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender
this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings
great replacement and a definite upgrade
makes the champ a super champ
these are value cables after all
however they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use
hopefully the at value cable will hold up
ill update this review if anything happens
for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems
i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic
much better than the more economical ones sold
i should have gotten the 15 foot but you live and learn
it matches my awesome at2035 microphone
this cable is very well constructed
i use this for my desk mic i use for recording
definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future
while i wish the bases came in different colors i really like these hangars
they look good and perform well
easy to install and hanging and releasing is a nobrainer
have three of these hercules hangers
used these for years on sons electric guitars
mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping
no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall
no neck damage to axes
mounts well but try to find a stud certainly
all 5 star reviews on this baby
and i agree and i add to that total
just to confirm several other reviews  these hangers are really nice
fine for a few weeks now
very solid and i feel comfortable hanging my taylor 414ce in this
i love these hanging hercules guitar hangers
works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course
how about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall
otherwise a great hanger that i trust for use with my expensive guitars
im just running out of wall space and money for new guitars
this is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people
i love the unique selflocking mechanism that it has
i have an electric and an acoustic hanging up
i believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs
i only installed into studs and wouldnt really want to try a drywallonly installation
others found this to be true too
i just finished putting them up and im completely satisfied with their solid construction
they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably
it can holds all the my guitars with no issues
the lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured
the autoclose function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger
simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime
i purchase this hercules gsp38wb ag guitar hanger for my yamaha 700
is just perfect for what is made for
i have purchased six of these over the last couple years
they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place
i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future
i could not expect a better violin stand
it is very robust versatile good looking and not very expensive
it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport
ive two of these stands
update  1912 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand
and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in
thats okay hes got competition and ill be purchasing from them instead
this is a great stand for your violin or viola
i play in small tight places
sometimes people dance right in front of us
when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift
i bought one for myself as well and i do like it
it comes apart quite easily
i do need a boom to keep the mic
stand away from my guitar when im playing and singing
this posilok miniboom is a nice clean look and is very functional
on stage has a well built unit here
best price i have found is at amazon
i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage
rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive
lighter than a full boom
its a short boom but it works great
i really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening
the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth
the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient
when this product appeared to be defective i contacted the seller
i thought that more than 25 of the items cost was a bit much
i decided to conatct the on stage people directly
i had the replacemnt in about four days
i have been using on stage instrument and microphone stands for several years now
they are extremely well manufactured they look great and are sturdy as heck
this mini telescoping boom is the bomb
it is built very well with long lasting parts
it looks very professional and works without any problems
it fit perfect on my new hercules mic stand and was ready to go
it holds your condenser mic very solid for a worryfree session
this one is definitely a hit
will buy again with other size
trust this cymbal once and you wont be disappointed
it lasts a pretty long while too
wuhan makes great products for the money
will review each one as they come in from amazon
i am very pleased with this 1634 crash
these harps have no volume
dont waste your money on them
52514  i said the case had no handle well i take that back
there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat
with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside
exceeded my expectations on quality and price
i have nothing to compare these too except my lee oskar
they sound good to me
thats whats most important right
it is a quality heavy cloth case with a feltvelvet lining
the notes are slightly difficult to bend but the reeds are still loosening up
all these harmonicas in one case and they sound great
overall reasonably satisfied will give them a good try later
disappointing was looking for to receiving these
but mostly they are unplayable
easier learning bagpipes than these things
save your money and get some harps that actually work
havent played the toy harps yet first things first
i bought the case for the case not for the included harps
i dont play these myself i bought them for my daughter
i cant bend at all so no idea if its just me
youtube these theres loads of videos
i have other harmonicas but thought id like a set of blues harps
i thought that if its made by hohner it must be fairly good
too hard to push notes through them
i wouldnt recommend these to anyone
great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking
i prefer a string with a little more volume
they tune well and hold a tune well
also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo
025 width to the e string
but the sound is awesome
the treble strings bend pretty easily
they have no coating  so they squeak like hell
tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar
they are basic standard traditional strings
they sound good they are light weight
on this guitar they sound a bit too bright
these strings do not last less time than the elixirs
mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar
there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar
the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play
i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style
so for the price these are an excellent value
firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet
lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible
they were tinny and clangy sounding
ive never heard worse strings
fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med
shame on martin for such a piss poor product
ill never buy their strings again
i would definitely buy these strings again
they are high quality great durablity and a great price
the martin name is synonymous with quality
i like these even better than the martin custom lights
they give off such a warm tone and are holding up very well
they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge
however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy
finger slides are much harder with these strings
the packaging was also a bit confusing
overall good strings and ill probably buy them again
by definition medium is an in between size
on that scale these strings would be above a literal medium
for me the guitar is not an everyday instrument
medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me
for me these lightmedium are exactly where i want my strings to be
i dont feel i am missing anything compared to the medium
but without that i dont think id notice the difference with normal listening
with the lighter varieties that would be far from true
these are the best strings around
i used daddarios for many years
i switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable
theyre 2 days on and sound fantastic already
personally i love the nanoweb strings
i have 4 guitars and they each get played once every couple weeks
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
fresh strings do sound better
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
but im not certain these last so much longer
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
elixir is a wonderful company
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
it is so simple and so reproducible
i only play elixir strings
i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar
of course they will be elixirs as well
i may buy another set soon and restring the shortscale instrument with lights
you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings
however you cannot go wrong with those strings
these are well worth the money
i love the elixir strings
they sound great and play easy
i would recommend them to anyone
a much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers
the great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost
i absolutely love these strings
they enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought
if there was a way to give 10 stars i would
theyre easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound
its like playing a silk guitar
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb
still a great guitar string
overall great strings and pretty consistent
ive been using elixir strings for about ten years now
i have never been much of a fan for coated strings
it is unusable until repaired
the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that
if you are doing more than just fingerpicking you might want to add pickshield
if you play mostly standing this is the guitar for you
but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar
good structural integrity thus far
i really should get a case
a friend of my has one and i just found in love with it
the applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified
first impression of the guitar was terrible
i took it out of the box and started to play
the neck had a huge bow in it
the truss rod was completely loose
i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable
once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised
the guitar sounded pretty good
the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric
upper fret access is really good
the guitar stays in tune while playing
plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises
the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch
i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting
they are a little small
175 for a roundback is really a no brainer
this instrument might actually be in a class of its own
this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument
that proved to be true to form
try them if its quality sound that youre looking for
way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic
these strings are my second choice after the elixir 8020 bronze
they are warmer sounding well balanced
cost a lot but well worth it to me
will need to check them next week or so
strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded
it was time to replace all with frest strings
these are great did the job
i have absolutely no gripes with elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings
ive read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage
also i like having the middle green led for tuning
i also use it to tune my violin and it works great
if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better
over all for the cost you cant go wrong
these used to be expensive noneessentials but today theyre small accurate and portable
got this tunermetronome as a replacement for a tuneronly model
this is incredibly easy to use right out of the package
the metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions eighth notes sixteenthsetc
this little box is great for metronome use
it is loud and the screen is easy to see
the tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes
i would buy another one if i lost this one
i really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs
i just miss the mecanical click of a mechanic metronome
the rest is just great
i am quite pleased with this product
its relatively inexpensive small and light weight
it operates on two aa batteries included
the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily
you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings
there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches
the metronome is pretty loud for the small size
the speeds are from 40208 bpm
it has a 18 mini earphone jack for private use
it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously
i bought mine from austin bazaar
shipping was free and fast
i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration
i bought this for my son and he loves it
as an acoustic guitar player i think this is a great product
i had previously been using the korg ga1 which is a fine basic tuner
the metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program
also it quit working suddenly after about a year
other people i know whove had this tuner have complained about lack of durability
works well since i got it
i didnt change battery for more than 6 months
the tuner is perfect for me
it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case
just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair
always spot on with the frequency
it is so durable filled with options
very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician
tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely its pretty sensitive
the metronome will drive you crazy
it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible
there are much better sounding metronomes out there
they now ship without the clips
so i sent it back to amazon for a refund
if you want to get humidity into a guitar this product is a must
erm it does what it say it would do
dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years
generally dampits can be used over and over for years
in addition to the standard dampit theres a soundhole cover
you simply attach the dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar
ive tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to
no expensive pads to buy just use water
comes out as easy as it goes in
i have 4 of them
it it isnt broke dont fix it
the only suggestion i would make is to have a different soundhole cover
i think the price is a little high for what it is
why do they charge so much
id like to know the markup
recently i switched from a blackstar ht5 to a fender mustang iii v2 amp
so although my cleans sound good they arent great
although my overdrive sounds good
well you get the picture
i believe some people call it 34pixie dust34
that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive
interestingly enough i dont leave this pedal on all the time
it works different than an eq
i think it really adds life to solid state amps
it does very well with single coils
this is a great pedal to put at the end of your fx chain
i have it as the last on my pedalboard before my gnx4
i do a lot of recording  i also checked the sound after recording
cant reccomend it enough especially considering the price
this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments
but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone
this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces
i also have the software version of this effect on my daw
i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
it definitely doesnt add any more fatness
im just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone
to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone
the lo contour knob doesnt increase the amount of bass produced by the amp
the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies
at first i almost couldnt tell a difference between having it on and off
this pedal adds that i dont know what to your sound
i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal  what a difference
it also works great for any instrument or sound system
its also great for vocals as well
but you may want the rack version for those applications
i have always loved hercules products
their mic stands and guitar stands
i bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from hercules
i also have the trombone and saxclarinet stand from them
all a at reasonable prices
foldsup pretty compact for travel
the optional carry bag is a must imho
a real workhorse for sure
i also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big
long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod
this is my 2nd hercules stand
great stand for managing multiple guitars
does not fair well when stored in non cooled area
the handle gets real sticky and causes problems
i have a friend who also experienced the same problem
so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand
just got my stand today
now a word about open back banjos if you are considering this stand
the tailpiece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing
the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest
also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands
not here plenty of room for everything now
also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet
check these things out you will not be disappointed
i will only every buy herc stands from now on
this is one of the cleanest sounding miniamps youll find
mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones
it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound
turning the odrive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle
of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp
im building a speaker cab with a jensen 6 speaker just for this amp
according to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab
but it is not very good at parties
it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make
it is cheap so you should just get one
see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
note  we have the burgundy color one
this is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier
the controls are volume off tone and overdrive
it also has a headphone jack
if your looking for an small amp
that will do metal this may not be for you
it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks
i said good not loud
if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased
great color and retro style as well
i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now
ive used all the roland cubes that are battery powered
on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone
id read some good reviews and 2000 isnt much money
going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones
i play rythm leads and sing in my gig
i have all the volume i need and great tone
the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set
i am amazed by this amp
i use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great
first lets not expect 500 double 1634 sound from a portable 9v amp
i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different
so it wont sound the same on every guitar
neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp
and i have to say the aqua color is major retro
ive been looking for 34the34 portable amp for some time
clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out
only complaint battery doesnt last too long
this little amp kicks major ass dood
good thing i had purchased the 9volt power adapter
i was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size
ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends
should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord
it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether
the color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color
paired with the zero hum ac adaptor its a highly portable amp setup
ultraportable by using a 9v battery instead of the ac adaptor
included with the amp is an owners manual with simple startup instructions
dont hesitate to pick one up for yourself
be prepared to purchase these in tandem
super buy on this miniamp
after using the better pickup the amp doesnt have any issue yet
i have used for few times so i dont know about its longevity yet
i play either a martin ae thru it or a strat knockoff
never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for 20
dont even think about it
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
for 20 you cant go wrong
based on other reviews i made my purchase
this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough
two downsides both are about the noise
i live on the 4th floor
as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio
i mean very loud radio background and i couldnt get ride of it
other than the radio part
overall i like it and i would recommend it
by the way this unit comes with a 9v battery
i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar
it was inexpensive and fun to use
the sound quality isnt the greatest but thats to be expected
this is the perfect amp for bed practice
bought this for my son
has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound
sounds great with an electric acoustic
its surprisingly loud for a small amp
you cant beat the price
it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on
its a 20 amp it does what it has to and does it well
this is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich
three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility
runs forever on a ninevolt battery
overall a great little deal for the price
stop waiting and grab one you cant go wrong
but it did the two things i wanted it for
this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price
just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it
this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter
i bought a planet waves 9v power adapter to go with the honey tone
it might work in a busker situation
this is a great little amp for practicing
but it eats batteries like they were candy
but if playing on the street corner is your thing
this little amp has a belt clip
ok ive owned 2 of these danelectro amps
plus the battery life is great
the included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes
i installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay and it lasts forever
for this price its hard to beat
this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one
and it is not a toy
it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments
i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice
to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip
then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town
in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input
it handles these without noticeable signal loss
what is this amp exactly
the result is quite appealing
and the overall look and feel is one of quality
the case is solid albeit plastic
the input 14inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid
it is more decorative than useful
the volume control is obvious
the tone control alters the basstreble mix but not very significantly in my opinion
the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree
the instructions describe 16 sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor
otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed
ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you
as i said this is small but really not a toy
i wanted to like this
the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think 34perfect34
the one i got kept cutting in and out
i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit
any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability
ive tried several 34portable amps34
for the price the honeytone cant be beat
they dont come much better
of course a guitar cable is a required extra
its the least obtrusive and best capo ever
i absolutely love it and im glad that the aluminum ones are durable
small lightweight and very easy to use dose the job well
i am thinking about getting a 2nd one
this inexpensive capo works as advertised
im happy with this purchase
i bought it during the black friday sale
it works for what i use it for
when not in use it just gets put away
doesnt take a lot of space
purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo
this capo was just perfect for my needs
in 40 years i have had every kind of capo out there
this is the right one
with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood
pretty darn good in every way
trim and easy to use
i recommend this capo without reservation
i like it and it is small
this is a fantastic little capo
if you have a classical guitar get a classical capo
dont write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind
i love this capo better than any i have seen or used
you wont go wrong with this capo
ive also got over a dozen capos dont ask
but all are for radiused fingerboards
if it lies flat then so is the fingerboard
if it rocks the fingerboard is radiused
my eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo
its easy for him to use and adjust
love this capo on my electric guitar
i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily
tried other more expensive capos but this one is the winner
you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this
oh well it was cheap enough to have around
this is an awesome capo
sounds great on my sg and my acoustic
theres nothing not to like about this capo
i have two of them
ive played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos
we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered 2 more
this is a very nice product to use
i would recommend it to anyone
it is small enough to be out of the way while playing
sturdy had it for a few weeks now
holds the strings down perfectly too great capo
these are nice easy to use capos and the price was great
a good purchase for a low priced capo
pros its small and lightweight
it not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality
unlike my steel string capo this uses a screwknob to tighten not spring loaded
it works on steel strings
i always seem to have to retune with the spring loaded capos
rarely have to re tune with this one
it took quite a long time to get it right
then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out
nothing gave me better tuning on the first try
then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck
it is a range of literally hundreds  perhaps even thousands of specific tones
the same is true for every note
however that tuner had at least two limitations
i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned
a nice extra piece of flexibility
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise
i used it for several years but it is only a backup now
i would not recommend it
this is a nice little tuner
it is small easy to read and use
it has a green led and large mark for being on target
if you have any vision problems the display might be an issue
isnt that asking a bit much
other than that it seems to work well
it is consistent easy to use and compact
having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three
what can i really say
cigar box guitar 3 string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna 6 string
getting ready to make few ukes and it will tune them also
need a all n one tuner buy this or an iphone
the korg is the perfecttuner
ive had two of these tuners
theyre durable and have a long battery life
this tuner is easy to use
it makes it so much easier
this is my first tuner in a long time and im please with it
excellent product it is well cushioned
im a typical overweight american
lucky timing all black and fully assembled
doesnt get any easier than that
the bench is very sturdy and comfortable  the cushioning is thick and soft
i actually like this bench a lot
with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag
i have the kt7800 which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated
the seat is very soft and comfortable
however it doesnt appear to hold anyone with excess weight
it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and wellmade
so not much selection there
for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height
the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep
i bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard
i like the price because of the special deal from amazon
the bench is comfortably padded and very affordable
it isnt top of the line but it gets the job done
it folds up easily and looks to be very well made
the price is a great selling point just by itself
it leads me to playing for longer periods
it folds and is definitely portable
it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes
when i bought this i though it wouldnt be enough
got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar
nice airlinesized bottle w safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening
replenished my dried out fretboard to likenew condition
i needed some fretboard cleaner
this is something i had not tried before
i used it and i like it
has a nice smell works like a charm
this bottle will probably last me 10 years
best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off
clean really good of prints and smell very nice
my first time using it but like it alot since it works good
has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way
i would definitely recommend this
worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard
take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy
this is an iconic fuzz pedal
this is not a subtle pedal
its cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp
i can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though
this is not a wooly splattery vintage tone like the dunlop fuzz face
it really has its own thing going on
its about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars
but its just not for me
its large and takes up space on my pedal board
get 2 amps and split the signal even
you want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal
otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of frail and bedazzled
otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference and it should
the free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter
if youre looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz this is the pedal you need
i only wish it went up to 11
it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing
note   this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack
as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound
this pedal does exactly what my title suggests
it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz
very smashing pumpkins feel to this
it doesnt do many different tones but what it does it does very well
this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards
ps  i have the russian variant
this is a fine bag for a guitar i got it for my brother
this one surpassed my expectations
months into using the gig bag and not a single problem
the pockets are packed with books tools and strings
the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze
has great pockets to carry your picks strings and tuners
the padding is better that i expected
it does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color
sturdy with adequate padding to protect my 34babies34
i own several gig bags and this is my favorite
this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage
the 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel
the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life
price was a big issue
the bag is well padded and i cant believe the price
i purchased this for my daughter who is 10
this bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly
i am going to purchase another one for my guitar
well see how long it lasts
but for now does the trick
this is a very good and stable stand
light strong and very balanced
it makes my guitar feel secure
this is my favorite light weight guitar stand simple and does the job
it is easy to assemble
this guitar stand does not find hidden treasure
it does not hypnotize beautiful women
it does not fix your transmission
it does not tell your boss to give you a raise
its sturdy reliable and to the point
just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced
if you need one might as well be this one
i bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price
i figured id get my moneys worth from them regardless
so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio
the price went up nearly 50 on them though
amazoncom did a great job too getting this out to me
it is like an added bonus
this seems like a nice product but maybe im doing something wrong
i cant get the bottom guitar support to lock in place
maybe there is something i need to do differently
i got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars
great little stands at a great price
they are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable
id suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand
i ordered two of these stands and they work very well
definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
case  arrived in great condition
nice bag with great features
it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either
i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good
i have 3 world tour bags to keep my axes safe
this is a great gig bag for the money
its even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks
and the pockets  oh the pockets
they fit all of my gear
and there is room for more if i need it
then you have the backpack handles as an option as well
i really cannot recommend this bag enough
for the price i feel like it is a steal
some people complain about the smell
it kind of smells like motor oil
be warned about it though
got this for an sgstyle guitar and it fits with plenty of room
it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening
the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip
surprised me because its a largetoothed zipper
construction seems to be pretty good
would i get another one
the bag is well padded and not to expensive
the dimensions are  41l 14w at bout and 3 deep
this is a great bag regardless of cost
free shipping only makes it that much better
unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell
i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed
as it is its very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii
this quality bag would probably cost more like 35 at your local music store
appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever
taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers
not terrible but somehow chemical
hope it goes away soon
i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to redo the board
i swear i was done in 20 minutes
the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length
these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality
always have a few spares that have been tested
is it easier than soldering
for the most part yes
will i continue using the product
yes because i usually have spares
why do i use them then
this is from the cleartone cables website about gold connectors don
the thin soft gold 510 microns
i am a tech as well as a guitar player
i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering
but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections
i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem
very good quality cable and plugs
easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft
this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while
cleans up your gears appearance tremendously
very easy to use and lots of extra cable length
this kit does the trick and truly was easy to use
some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit
but eventually i figured it out
one is its height adjustable and two is the tilting head
it does twist around a bit when you handle it
for my practices and rehearsals i want to travel light
i always play sitting so height is not a consideration for me
thats plenty high for me even if i were a vocalist and im 61
it may be a challenge to assemble it
i am not good at putting things together without help
good product after you get it assembled
as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand
i would recommend this purchase to any one
this stand is a little difficult to open
the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way
its easy to set up and use
simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it
i re soak it easy 23 weeks or so
cant tell if its truly working on my maple wood ukulele
i have been using hercos for for many years
they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification
great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness
works if you keep it with instrument in your case and upkeep is minimal
stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity
a must have for us dry californians
it doesnt seem to work
at first i was not sure what i was looking for
i found the product without too much difficulty
dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part
i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist
the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward
i may order another if this one performs well
i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings
but it was a bit of a pain
you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it
even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar
this is much easier and the guitar sounds great
great for old school rock and roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc
this will fatten up the sound of a dry amp
this pedal works but doesnt have the depth of echo i expected
that certainly explains the difference in price
you get what you pay for
im using it with a fender eightyfive solid state amp
i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same
its just not as good as i expected
im sorry i bought it and i dont recommend this pedal
there are much better ones on the market
i wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didnt
this pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy
really quick to setup and use
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music
but for 20 dollars its well worth the price
this is a great product and i highly recomend it
i replaced it with  mini modtone type delay
anyway i figured since the pedal was so cheap why not try it out
you know it is a pretty decent stompbox
just gives you a mellow reverbish echo
not quite delay not quite reverb
kind of somewhere in between
for kicks try it out with some distortion andor overdrive and a wah
is the the best pedal ever
does it do exactly what you want a simple slapback echoreverb to do
the sound i get with it is very very cool
after a while it just stopped working
you cant beat the price
so i ordered another one
definately get an adapter for this
yes its casing is plastic but quite sturdy
if you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals
id suggest buying them by the gross
i have amps that have this feature that due a better job
its a flange pedal what else
for the price i was really happy with it
the shape is cool but id feel safer with it in a metal casing
i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed
the depth knob does its job
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
wide sweeping flange effect great harmonics and little power useage
im a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished
i want them to be slick when i bend notes
these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets
i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them
i think amazon had the best price
my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets
obviously cardboard isnt going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths
im going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it
will this replace a pro fret job
i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great
its got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too
solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag
eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve
a must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables
i keep this with my battery tester for my actives
sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble
easy to use and economical product
it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat
it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast
dont go onto the stage without one on these boxes
we bought this tester for our son to use for his bands equipment setup
does a great job of checking cords
was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash
tests multiple types of cords also
it is well built and sturdy
i suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside
although the machine itself is good the accompanying documentation is awful
it presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack
i had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram
this thing will test most all the cables a musician will use
rugged reliable and simple to understand
for the price it is hard to beat
all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts
runs on 2 aa batteries
very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment
intermittent issue indication  this is what made me choose this model
if theres even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it
intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot
it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife
theres an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back
this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous
luckily i have no need for the clip
i stuck some repurposed rubber feet on the bottom
for the price its worth it i guess
but for the price its not too bad
oh and the casing isnt like a wimpy plastic knife plastic
it does what is supposed to and it doesnt have a cheap look
for home and garage entertainment is good enough
im only sad they dont make a noise gate or something similar
that would be the top of the deal
but it seems lacking to me
uses a 9v battery or 9v adaptor
it has a retro look and an old school sound perfect
i have 3 of the danelectro effects pedals
im partial to the chorus
its plastic thats 1 star deduction but in this case very pleased overall
several other combinations are excellent too
check youtube theres plenty on this great price pedal
sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords
i even like it with the bass
just a great chorus with not much to tweak
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
yes this pedal is made of plastic
the chorus effect has plenty of adjustment tone and depth
absolutely a 5 star value
the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals
housed in a plastic casing
dont expect the fab series to be good at everything
its just a great option to have for casualbudget guitarists
gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings
but it was what i was looking for
has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too
and hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change
if you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect
i mean  the range rate arent as broad as others ive tried
but i stomp on it regularly
it cuts my signal a bit
i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices
i got the 50 standard black on black case
regarding the item itself i am bit lukewarm
i decided to try the guardian and save a few bucks
seems like i made a good choice
the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great
this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china
fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for
normal plush fake fur inside with about 34 of soft foam all around
black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay
only annoying thing  the case arrived locked
the keys were of course inside the case
great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f335 perfectly
solid and steardy case that will last a very long time
good quality strong and excellent finish
it does exactly what it says it does
my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower
was using a box and this is a great help
my stomach doesnt feel wrenched anymore
i use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg
maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me
great foot rest its not flimsy
but its not light weight
i like that its adjustable to various heights
great foot rest i recommend it
just what i needed to position my guitar while seated
i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well
there isnt too much to say about it
it really made playing easier for me
this little foot stool is really sturdy
it stays in place beautifully
no rocking sideways no wobbly action
but the positions it allows make sense for 99 of players
this is heavy but strong
does fine on hard floors
the other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built
good idea but way too lightrickety to be useful
im glad i bought this
this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value
im 62 and weigh 225
the photo makes them look weaker than they are
i purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear
i do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom
small enought to fit on top of a table or under it
light weight but holds a lot
i loaded it up with equipment and havent had a worry about it since
solid construction and the mounting just works
this one is done right
simple and useful rack stand
easy to mount rack components
but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too
a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality
this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig
it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box
the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built
this stand is great for my 45lb peavey 1500
i wouldnt put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed
i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily
i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under 5 minutes
it is very sturdy and very stable
i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up
i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly
its definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this
i use this with my mobile dj equipment and it is fantastic
very sturdy and light enough to easily carry
holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation
they work very well on the floor
the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank
i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear
this stand is very stable and useful
sure its a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it
for 99 dollars  quit looking at other wah pedals
this one does it all
sounds very authenic 60s too
endless variations in sound avaialable
it gets a great sound right out of the box
your option to change the wah configuration is amazing
only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately
lunar lander here we come this pedal will take your playing to the moon
use the crybaby with other effect pedals the uses are endless and fun
its right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time
im sure ill be using the crybaby for the rest of my music life
this is the pedal to own
a great purchase and built like a tank
i didnt want to spend 600 on a wah with a rack
the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable
the user dials in the frequency sweep they want
this is the wah i was looking for
very versatile and built in boost feature is great too
first of all i love the crybaby 535q and i recommend this wah pedal
i will tell you my wah pedal story
finally i gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely
the wahs were usable but just did not sound as good
so it was time to get a real wah
it is definitely one to consider and the price is not that bad
delivered promptly and in excellent shape
i bought to use for my squire strat
it also fit my tele to
this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case
i dont have any complaints
it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power
the portable feature is great also
its really not a 200w system
i found one of these used for half the retail price
besides who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works
25th i think others have mentioned problems with pylepro audios customer service
i must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too
i wrote a least three times and got no response so far
was transferred to a dept
which never picked up the phone
i still love the pwma230 but i am no fan of its manufacturer
28to be fair someone did finally contact me today
ill update as to the answers and information provided
this system works just okay
try to turn it up and you get bad feedback
my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item
i only use this as a tube amp for vocal
however buying behringer products always require crossing fingers and hope that they last
so ill update should i encounter problems
this is a wonderful product for the price
ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain
behringer makes great products at incomparable prices
i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception 220 microphone
there are 2 ins and 2 outs 1 balanced1 unbalanced on each channel
i run this direct to my digital recorder
i get a good clean sound on my vocals
still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit
5 stars for price quality features amazon
dont like that its difficult to change the tube
no power cord was included in mine or manual
manual should have been include not sure about the cord
my mic200 and mic800 are much better than this
i cant say its bad
just that there are better choices in my opinion
fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube
if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired
if the behringer dies its going in the trash and ill buy another one
they have an industry standard packaging
the input and output connectors are excellent
reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit
thats a winwin in my book
it has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch
the carrying case is also nice
getting used to the attachment
it will never stand in the position like in the photo
theres no resistance on that joint so it flops down
just place it upside down
record using a headset or youll get too much feedback
just ordered a shorter stand
hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down
i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux2
have had tons of compliments on the sound
people cant belive its a 50 dollar mic when i tell them
such a fantastic price on this cant beat it
im kind of feeling my way
includes a nice hard plastic carrycase too
for this kind of money you cant really go wrong
for the money this mic performs very well
i also put a pop filter on it
this is my first real recording microphone
im glad i did because its really great
one thing you will need though is a phantom power unit
excellent sound quality much better than any other mic ive used
and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included
however behringer makes a distinction between the c1 and the c1u
the description on amazon fits the c1u not the c1
its ready to gojust plug it into your laptop and start recording
i use sound studio but the included free softwareaudacityworks practically as well
and if the mistake is due to amazons description returns are generally postagefree
this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received
do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit
that said for the price it is an excellent product
this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations
for a normal use this is quite good
feels little tiny but excellent gain
i would buy it again if required
i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck
these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand
they do need 48 v phanom power from your board or a mic amp
these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work
they have a smooth unhyped sound
2 1534 speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet
these hold up great year round
it came today like the computer said it would
to my surprise there wasnt even any tape on it
and why would i shop any where else
its a cheap speaker stand
heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be
cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke
overall though itll do the job
or so maybe more if you keep them lower down
they look nice and are easily worth their selling price
this product is simple does the job and is well priced
ive been happy with them so far
a fine product that i expect to last for years
i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus
filters out noise well when using the mic
only two things to gripe with  1
the leg that you can use to prop this up isnt very usable
its not great for gig use as the screen isnt that readable
as a home tuner or for a brightlylit gig  excellent
it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically
i find myself using it a lot
even as i learn the notes on the guitar fretboard
if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note
i also use it to intonate my guitar
it has some other advanced features but i havent need them
for what its worth i am a professional musician with perfect pitch
the main problem with this tuner is the usability
tuning with it can be condensed into one word  frustrating
combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar
used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin
what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it
my guitar room isnt super bright and its very difficult to read
guess thats why the price is so cheap
battery life appears to be adequate
oh and not to forget
shipping was faster than advertised
a thumbs up for this one
amazon comes through again on price and product
ive owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years
like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable
even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end
so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input
ive been very disappointed with this tuner
i have tried several different brandstypes of tuners in my 13 years of playing
i have found that this model fits my needs perfectly
it also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etc
it is also small and portable
i cant recommend this tuner enough
the quality and feel of this tuner is very good
this is my first tuner and its great already
the leds are a little cheesy compared to the old one though
but maybe that saves on battery life
this was the easiest tuner i had
i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded
there are better tuners out there
trust me your money is best spent elsewhere
bought to tune my bass
works fine and at the this price it cant be beat
highly recommend for budget tuner
had to return the first one
second is holding its own
just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic
spot on when used correctly inline with cables
this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it
overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand
i am self taught guitar for about 15 months
without this i would be lost
i work with a guy who has played guitar for 30 years
he tunes it to itself
for 15 you cant beat this
buy this and enjoy it
i always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal
fender heavies what more needs to be said
great price for the quantity
i buy tons of them all the time
i figure 12 dozen will last me for years
these are the best celluloid shellcolored thin picks around
tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end
no matter what color the floorcarpetstage is you can find your pick easily
i like the extra heavy picks
they suit my playing style well
i dont have to wait for it to snap back it doesnt bend
they dont break either although they do wear down over time
kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping
i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick
thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping
these are the only picks i use
theyre fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent
they arrived on time and i will order them again
these picks break way too easy
great heavy picks amazingly cheap price
you really cant go wrong
i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry
and this has been great to have an endless supply
daddarios are top quality and very reasonably priced
my choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics
nice bright and full sound
good life they sound good for a couple of months
i am happy with this product
guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic
these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips
even though i ordered large
i do not have giant hands so large should fit
heavy if thats what your looking for
this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well
i think that you will love it if thats what youre looking for
the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control
in short   its a winner
when they say small they mean small
find the same slide in large and i wrote a complimentary review there
got them today and put them on a wasburn x series
i would recommend these to anyone
an inexpensive but nice set
i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster
it came with entry level strings
these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument
be advised the low e string is thick
well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that
plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game
i have used the exl115w set for years
nice to have the whole set again
i like the sound of the wound third
no more thick calouses on the fingers
playing weekinds and practicing they last a long time with the same sound quality
the tones are warm and welcoming not as sharp as with other strings
it is the sound that i like though
this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars
it is very easy to apply great results and very little effort
im surprised by the results
never got this shine in my guitar with any other product
i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture
guitar slips a little off my knee
but very happy just wish had sometype of order
first wax i have bought
i tend to use cleaning sprays
i am going to be waxing now on
gerlitz makes this wax easy not greasy
this tin should last a lifetime
it comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars
i would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze
leaves no ffingerprints or smudges
not a sufficient defect to return the instrument
another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal
also got the tuning pegs
this is a 000  om acoustic
along with a few high end guitars i also have a few beaters
fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great
i thought it worked good and mine was a bit dry
mine wasnt that cracked and it worked great
it is reliable and rock solid
the tripod base has been very steady so far
it really is a great product
i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material
and it did but not at all the guitar contact points
it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward
reality  lets say the stand held onto the guitar
it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar
blame the moron who knocked over your guitar
the guitar touches the floor
this stand is worth the extra money over those 15 disasters
spend an extra 10 and save yourself the headache
the absolute best guitar stand made
i bought one about 4 months ago and just ordered a second
hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands
it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well
with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar
it holds both electric and acoustics
the stand is very well constructed and very stable
the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders
all guitar stores display their guitars with them
lets have a go  im glad i did
my stand doesnt tip over like the others
you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out
the fingers in front hold the instrument in
lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument
however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build
no big deal just more parts and weight
the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates
both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks
it was defective in more than two areas
always found the hangingtype to be the safest  most secure
for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand
this is the only type of stand i prefer to use
wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night
i really expected better quality for 3500 after such light use
still love it but not to a 5 star level
i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul
i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar
i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place
i usually buy locally but the deal here was great
the stand is worth the price and more
this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market
it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe
the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism
the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand
my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism
i would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black
im hoping they last a while
i put these on and what a difference
these arent too heavy not too light
just make sure to change them often to get the best performance
consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand
what more can i say
these are not going to unwind on you or break easily
thats all there is to say about it
quality strings at a very affordable price
i am learning to play the guitar
i debated between this one and the other popularslightly more expensive one
the same goes for tilting
i love it and i am using it almost every single day
very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find
go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered
just a warning to those that are picky
buy it youll like it
it will survive a nuclear blast
this is the stand you remember from the band room
effective and built like a tank
you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task
this stand is very good
we use it to hold the musics and dont need to turn the head
this one work great for us
good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should
a bit annoying but not the slides fault i guess
for the price im really happy
i lost my trusty slide and really miss it
if it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick
the dunlop is well made as expected
its just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind
this one works fine so far
it is rather heavy and i like that
be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however
otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger
sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars
i have a ceramic and this steel slide
each has a unique sound
the steel as expected has more of brighter twang
make sure you order the right size
fast delivery and exactly as advertised
put it to work making music within minutes
perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size
this is why i give only 3 stars because is to small for me
i have several different slides glass brass steel short long etc
works great for blues rock a little stoner country and even some metal
the main genres i play inharmonics and sustain to spare
im borderline skinny and it still wont fit
save your money unless your under 10 years old
i love these picks especially in this gauge
the tone it gives isnt bad either
black tortex picks with silver lettering
they provide enough surface area that they wont slip easily from between your fingers
any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use
nice picks much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks
but these pitch blacks are not bad
but then i tried this
60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups
more mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack and less lows
it just sounds heavier tighter and more articulate
but you dont have to take my word for it
i like them but i love the schaller locks more
they dont feel as secure as the schaller locks
but once you got it its a fine product
this system does not fail
install it and you never have to worry about it again
although its a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while
i put these on all of my guitars
i use these on all my guitars
easy to assemble and use
once installed they are fantastic
these do that much better than schallers and the fender ripoffs of schaller
i used the schallers many years ago
i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc
the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring
it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident
its kind of tough at first but with experience its very easy
the package instructions are correct but not very helpful
maybe try those but im sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops
a bit invasive and awkward
i like another brand more because they feel a little more solid
these feel a bit weak
i just got these in and i have to say very disappointed
what do they call medium or small
this large pick  barely goes over my thumbnail area
btw im an average grown man 57 165  more to come
decided to try the dunlop
overall  im very pleased with this pick
previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums
this is true but isnt a complete description
i wear a large sized glove so assuming that would translate i got these
my thumbs dont have a particularly excessive diameter either
im gonna try to heat these so i can stretch them a bit
essentially a waste of money
i have a gibson les paul that i bought used
when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry
so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey
i ordered it and applied it
i decided to give it another 24 hours
the next day the guitar neck looked and played great
bends and slides are smoother than ever
great product and one that i will continue to use
but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation
a little goes a long way
it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say
i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics
makes the fretboard look and feel nice
they had mimimal oilstain from the factory
keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks
this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier
i used this and the color became rich and less dry
if your fret board is pretty dry do not remove the oil
let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel
leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is
i didnt even notice a smell
i definitely would say this is a musthave
i requested this for christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it
ive used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great
you will notice that some areas soak it more than others
i move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly
then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and youre ready to go
i like making my strings last longer
i dont think youll regret it
an hour after its applied it sets up and doesnt get on your hands
the best few bucks youll spend on guitar care
leaves board clean and fast
no residue no sticky and no oil film
if you use any fingerboard treatment try this one
just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me
the capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well
i am using it with a seagull entourage mini jumbo
inspires my ears to make music
thats all i can say
ive been using this for roughly a year now and it works fine
it feels a bit cheap but then it is cheap
overall i like it and its certainly worth the minimal price
it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos
with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff
do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin
so far it doesnt look like it will though
this works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three
itll do for setup work and the price is right
i also wouldnt recommend it for anyone just starting out
a spring clamp type capo would serve better
works like it is suppose to good quality
it gets abused so i dont look for it to last long
would not buy it for my own guitar
havent put a pad there or anything
the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control
you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz
however range of motion is on the wide side
i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars
im surprised i havent broken it yet
i got it today in the mail and i already tried it
its really cheap product but it works really well
this string winder is adequate but not really solid
it gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft
this is just adequate for my use
i got this to help with that
it does it job very well
you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time
pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price
id order again if i needed another one
it is a nice smaller version of the 114si road pro
it would be great if it had a steel shaft
the plastic shaft feels like it will break
and thats all ive got to say about it
costs a little extra but well worth that price
youll need a new one about every ten years or so
for the price you cant beat it
fits in your pocket gig bag etc
so you can have this thing on the go
works great and you cant beat the price
lets face it in general string winders are pretty much all the same right
i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name
already ordered a different one to replace it
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools
i gotta remember not to get the black ones though
a simple device yet so useful
i hate changing strings without one anymore
dunlop provided an inexpensive winder thats durable
you knew that when you bought it
it was only one and it was red
2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars
this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new
i threw  out my gibson spray
drducks wax is worth the extra 3
this bottle will last a lifetime
you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish
it will polish and lube things like floyd roses
do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil
wipe them down with a little dr
ducks ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case
the secret is always use the least you can get away with
too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever
use very little of this
rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off
it also lubes your strings
i dunno cause im stingy with stars
these have a nice sound
so i replaced with these
its a classic guitar it shouldnt have had steel strings to begin with
you can hear the difference once it is used
i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance
these are really cheap strings but how they sound
daddario strings have never failed me
these strings sound nice and you cant go wrong with the price tag either
restrung my guitar with no problems
i can really hear the difference between new and old strings
the strings are nice and smooth and springy very easy to press on
these take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm
they made my cordoba c5 sound like a more expensive guitar
i bought a cheap 34 guitar that sounded really bad
in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings
with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar
one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings
very nice resonant and clean
makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally
i cant really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings
it sounds really good on my classical guitar
will buy it again in the future
whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel
their strings produce excellent sound and are durable
like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style
that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing
but ive never played a set of this brand that i didnt like
they always provide vibrant tonal quality
and no i dont work for daddario just a longtime fan
i love these picks and the
88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing
i am a long time user of the big fender triangular picks
i play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in columbus ga
i bought a set of these to try them out
i guess im just too used to the big pick
these are my favorite picks to play with
the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic
these are excellent guitar picks
tortex picks are the best
pitch black is so cool
10 mm is the perfect thickness
dont buy those other picks buy these because tortex
10 mm is the perfect combination
these are much more flexible so they last forever
just be aware that 050mm is really light for most players
my favorite is the 070mm
it has the perfect balance of flex and strength
i sprayed on all my guitars
no problem with any chemical reactions
it polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new
now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice
it must be from a product like this
they seriously look brand new
makes nicks and scratches less noticeable
i love the dunlop formula 65 polish and cleaner
it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism
ive used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles
this one works almost like a mist
it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints
after im done the shine looks glassy and great
it has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all
a little goes a long way
my guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65
i use it on my acoustic and electric guitars
the bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine
it has a fresh lemon scent
i recommend this to everyone a lot of product for an affordable price
gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop
he was right  great product
the standard for mild nonoily instrument cleaners
leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes
i have used it for years
item arrived on time and as described
my son loves this polishcleaner
he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny
they glisten when he uses this to polish them
i decided to trythe dunlop formula 65 polish  cleaner
i thought why not try a 2 in 1 formulation
possiblyfaulty logic but i went with it at the time
well i have to say that it did well
this guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish
i am thankful that i did not have any of said cracks or chips
i am usually oneto read directions thoroughly but not this time
the finish looks very good
this 4oz bottle will go a long way
it doesnt take much to work
that iswhen i decided to get the dunlop polisher  cleaner
it definitely worked a lot easier than the untreated microfiber cloth
be careful out there people
amazonhas placed it there as a public service
just thoughtyou ought to know
then i tried this recipe
it does everything the product description tells you about
excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal
no nasty residue build up over time
youll like this stuff better than anything youve used to date
or at least i think so
shines nice and doesnt leave it feeling oilysticky
smells nice and makes your guitar looking new
this polish works well for what i need it for
shines up guitars very nice
i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz
it does its job in fantastic fashion but doesnt last the longest
the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts
this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used
this is a must for black guitars
only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz
its quite expensive for 4oz
but 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine
does not leave streaks if used properly
this dries quickly every time
have used it on a couple of ukuleles
easy to use wipe on and wipe off
it really makes your guitar shine
also the price is right
this is just an excellent product
there is enough in one bottle to last a very long time
puts on a good shine for your instrument
i like the spray bottle applicator
you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings
you end up using just the right ammount
it has truly elevated my playing a few notches
pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue
lasts a long time 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar
cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent
cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine
ive even used this on matte or light finishes with good results
tip  a little goes a long way
i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month
its cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well
if not this one at least buy some kind of cleanerpolish
this really does shine up your wood quite well
there arent enough uke straps out there for a good price
i returned mine as it just didnt fit well for my uke or mandolin
recently acquired an ovation mandolin which itself is hardly 34standard34 in appearance materials etc
so i thought it would bea good opportunity to try a 34nonstandard34 strap
im thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin
this strap was very well designed and thoughtout before going to manufacture
this is a good looking strap
much lighter and thinner then any strap that i have had
looks great on my blond tele
the price is right as well
not your fender quality strap
this is a cheap extremely low quality strap
i would not recommend it
feels like wearing a 10 casio with a 1300 suit
light weight allows you to remove quickly
it is pretty comfortable to wear also
i have three of these straps more my strats
for the price this is a pretty nice strap
its thin but does the job well
i used to buy leather straps but not any more
this strap is very nice and comfortable
its also the cheapest one i ever bought
thanks it does what its meant to do
for the price this is a wonderful strap
it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable
it also has that vintage fender coolness factor
the truth is they will work on anything
the strap ends are great but theyre not really secure
gaskets can take care of that
a very wellmade strap with great looks and a super price
it just feels lighter than i like but thats a personal thing
i have no complaints about the construction the looks or the price
this cloth doesnt slide around and thats a good thing
this one is just a waste of money
get something better that doesnt twist up an ravel into knots
its cheapit worx what more to say
i wish there was a fine pivotangle adjustment to orient harp to mouth
for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth  lol
this is the least expensive holder i could find nov 2013
a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design
i ordered both this one and the lee oskar
this was my first shoulder rack and i didnt know what to expect
they all need one more joint to adjust the angle
ive had hohner racks before so i was prepared
i use harmonica holders for kazoos
i may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic
the angle for kazoo use is fine
obviously not everyones head and neck are the same as mine
this holder may work well for harmonica for some people
if you can you should try on holders before you buy
great harmonica rack for smaller harps
very strong in the set when worn
a must have for any folk player
this was the first time i ventured into the world of harp
i figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too
i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack
im not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with
this rack is constructed better than i had really expected
getting he harmonica unto te springloaded holder can be a bit tricky
still this is a good deal
this is an excellent product
ive used one of these before and dont remember it having lock washers
when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened
for 10 you cannot go wrong with this
i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there
and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height
but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort
2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly
its a great deal if youre willing to do a little work on it
this is a good neck rack for gigging
but that goes for all neck racks really
once its fit to you though it works beautifully
i use mine  daily and it hasnt failed me yet
overdrive that wont drive you over
works great for the price
at this price range this little effects pedal does admirably
you can get pretty decent sound out of this
other than that ive had no problems
at less than 15 you need to be able to look past these things
this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended
no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going
i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great
that doesnt make it worse or better just different
there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market
it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers
incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes
great little pedal for a very reasonable cost
it has a good range of overdrive levels
its different and just worth having to mess around with
just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last
also the blue led is very bright
thats either an annoyance or great
youll either love it or hate it
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this pedal is remarkable for useful tones
the low price tag didnt hurt my feelings either
this is a winwin buying decision as far as i am concerned
the fab overdrive pedal does not work well for me
i have a epiphone les paul special ii with a fender frontman 25r amp
no matter how i adjust it it has a muddy sound
ive heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results
the guitar is new and has the strings that came with it
there are several reviews of this product on you tube
you can do a search there and hear what it is capable of
ill keep it as a spare just in case anyway
otherwise its a good idea
old tech bungee type of capo
works well on mandolins too
since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand
it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping
ive used it  at both inside and outside gigs without any problems
other than being a little cheaply built it works great
i like the fold up into a small package idea
fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap
very well made although the bag is a little lower quality
goes up and down and tilts back
much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before
a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
i really really like it
it assembles quickly and easily and folds up into a nice package for transport
it is very sturdy and holds big music books very well
this little stand serves so many purposes for me
of course that is 54 solid inches of stage front though
love that i didnt have to assemble this stand
just had to unfold it
was easy to adjust and is very stable
also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use
this is certainly a heavy duty stand
this makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices
this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88key keyboard
its really flexible on how youre planning to put on top of it
i have a 1918 chezch violin and its sparked my 11 year olds interest
got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin
added a couple drops and it worked like a charm
a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin
i got this product to see if i could fix the problem
it worked just as it said it would
tuning then became a breeze
coulda had a veggie drink
these drops are not just a convenience
in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists
buy this it does work and it works very well
also each instrument is different each peg is different
this stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way
one bottle should last you a very long time
what to expect  with one drop the effect is immediate
you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better
this helped them all to stay in place even better than before
buy it use it and be happy
id guess they have about 100 years of wear on them
i used to be able to deal with it
violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem
i figured id give the drops a try
i decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings
i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem
the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended
i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back
for any beginner this is the guitar i would but in there hands
i still write all my songs on this and play it more then my
i am so happy she did
my first thought was now i have to learn how to play this thing
i am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with
i now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars
i wanted to wait until i knew a little something before i reviewed it
first i dont know how they sell these for the price they do
the action is nice and low good especially for a beginner
i did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference
i use light daddaro strings and love the tone and feel
the yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as youd expect for this price
the tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough
it sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it
read the other reviews this is a really nice value
i do have my eye on a martin though
5 plus stars for this one
if youre considering it buy it
you will not regret it
i still play this on almost every day
this guitar is probably one of the best i have ever owned
the tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings
for under 200 im amazed at how nice this guitar is
and it stays in tune nicely too
i did replace the strings shortly after getting it
now this guitar is a joy to play
problem is i get nothing done because i cant put it down
and i like the mother of pearl yahama inlay on the headstock
the quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch
it just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands
this is a very nice guitar the finish and construction is high quality
the hardware is what you would expect from a yamaha product
i really cant think of anything negative to say about it
the fg 700s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar
it has a deep tone and good volume
most definitely one of the best 34bangforyourbuck34 acoustic guitars
this one is probably closer to a 150 guitar
the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison
now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines
5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales
a must have for guitar teachers imho
i cant see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all
the lines for the strings and frets are very close together
see my previous evaluation on a similar product
the ultimate in low tech
its a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose
i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individuals needs
im pleased with both stamps
works just as i need it to
adjusts easily nice width comfy enough for me
sam ash was very courteous in fixing the problem
this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them
quick to set up  tear down  adjust
the bench is also larger than my others
very happy for the price
unit works fine with my digital piano
its light portable and fairly sturdy
the price is right for what you get
wow a bench that really holds my ass
what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand
and it was necessary to the group
its wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use
it feels heavy duty and stays still during use
this is a very stable comfortable seat
the legs are easily removable for storage
i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue
ive tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc
but it was always awkward
i just wasnt at the right height
it was absolutely worth the small investment for me
on its tallest setting this gives me the exact height i need
im 6 so it might not be high enough for a very tall person
the cushioning is nice and thick as well
ive been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011
its great in all ways but one  the rubber feet constantly fall off
on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble
works as advertised for my purpose
i have other behringer gear and it always works
with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp
this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price
so certain compromises have been necessary
or use a nicer external power supply  the first thing id upgrade
recommended if your budget is limited
behringer has done it again
the pp400 ultracompact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like its ultracompact
it takes up a very negligible amount of space
it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component
in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability
it has no trouble amplifying a turntables signal to line level
the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point
this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look
unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black
its one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product
summary if you need a preamp buy this one
it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps
but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright
the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others
i am using a vintage garrard turntable
the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp
this problem is gone with the new preamp
it does sound ok other than being a little bright
it does do what is supposed to do
i have been using this preamp for a year and it has been great
i bought this to replace a behringer uca202
not only is it interferencefree it has a much warmer intimate sound
its usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues
reaper had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel asio
everything just works great first time
i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail
the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate
make sure you have a good microphone to use with it
the alpha is a great little interface
it accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer
its powered via the usb
i like cakewalks software better anyways just my preference
some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording
i havent had a problem with this
it is extremely silent save any noise i would generate anyway from my rig
this a solid performing unit at this price point
my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap
i have been a gigging musician for over 20 years
easy to plug in i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband
very quality recordings so far
still have yet to mic up a drum kit
still enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use
did try to install software on a pc with vista no luck
snare kick and so on
i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way
i bought this to work with my 9 year old son
i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software
i have been using audacity which is a free download
i would pay the price again in a hartbeat
boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet
i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat
it does that my dial is set at 10 oclock
in livepractice situations at high volumes it doesnt bother me much
in the studio i wont use this pedal for that reason
it was the right price for me right now
if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more
i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp
overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended
i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill
its a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations
it will bring the extra juice you need
i pretty much just leave these on all the time
the price is good i bought it locally for the same price here
the tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great
i use it with distortion and overdrive with good results
i cannot shower enough praise on the lpb1
i keep it on all the time since it always improves soundquality
but these are as advertised
havent used enough to see if images wear well
or just disappear from use
but they are what they are
these are fantastic and unique guitar picks
i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well
love them and theyre good quality picks too so i will use them
nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls
gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot
its a great little unit
at least its cheap though
i just wish it had a power switch
please please please please do research before you buy anything
i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations
small yet clean and versatile
great for gigging remote events
a great value for the money
this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected
great product for entry level and great price for what you get
for the multi guitar owners i think this is great
it is limited in what it can do but it does the job
im rapidly becoming a behringer fan
id also like to see another set of outputs on it as well
bass into one channel ipod into another headphones out
there are other solutions to this dilemma
pocketsized headphone amps and so on
so whats the behringer xenyx 502 like in this use scenario
the blue power light is blinding
speaking of those knobs they seem a little rickety
be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly
strange for this particular usage scenario
overall i think this unit is a great value for the money
bucks for an 8input mixer
i wanted to do it through my maudio profire 610
i had 4 mics 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set
i love my profire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong
add two monitors and youve got yourself a nice little pa
it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties
having an fx send is awesome when using it live
i didnt think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that
and gotten the 12 channel one
i use it with a small amp for singing
and the price it right
great little mixing console for home use and practice
this thing has phantom power just in case you didnt read that already
one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button
i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh
i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led
what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led
i just got this to run my passive pa
its inexpensive and easy to use
very portable and does the job it was designed to do
this has more features than ill ever likely use
has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer
appears to be well made
you cannot go wrong with this mixer
very clean sound very versatile
for what this does you cant go wrong for the price
i have a small recording setup and play guitar and bass with friends
this little mixer gets both of those jobs done right
it does all of those jobs well
there is no hum when the unit is on
i have two small grips though
this worked out of the box
there is no noise or other problem so far
looking to buy more soon
works fantastic and i am very happy with it
when i got it in it didnt work
behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it
i had to send it back for a refund
however ive used one of these boards before
it seems to be very durable as well
behringer is the way to go
i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs
it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer
for the price it does a very good job
i recommend this mixer for your home studio
it works perfectly with my sound card
you do not need usb to get this to work
this mixer is just what ive been looking for
the 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects
34 anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price
anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one
this board is great no sliders which i had to clean
it makes the stuff i do in logic easy
highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost
small compact functional and it works
connect mics ipods mp3 players
and control sound and volume at your fingertips
this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified
soon i will be in the market for an upgrade
just waiting for a good deal
the packing way below average
as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning
second unit too had the similar packing but no damages
it does exactly what is expected of it
relatively transparent and controls are responsive
this mixer handles it all perfectly
i didnt need the fx
i wish it had a power button
the mixer arrived early which was a lifesaver
everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs
i am looking forward to using more of the effects
this is one of the quietest mixers ive ever used
the range of adjustability is excellent
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
the mic preamps sound pretty good  clean and relatively quiet
the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made
the builtin effects are probably its weakest point
ive heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit
i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack 802 that i had
im quite please with the xenyx 1202
lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound
im very happy with this little mixer
this mixer has four mic inputs
it has some fun effects
i do not hear any external noise
it has a durable metalic case
this mixer has great audio
unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it
makes a perfect small studio combination
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
id say the effects are just soso
looking forward to more tests
it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case
ive been using the mxl990
mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective
used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started
i still recommend the mic though
this mic is really nice
works great on voice overs singers and rappers
there was one review that mentioned it isnt for female vocalists
i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician
i record songs in my home as a hobby
will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much
are you likely to find it in a highend professional studio
is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point
i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro
is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy
but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open
admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then arent all mic evaluations subjective
and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful
i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up
i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio
i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful
plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs
makes my voice sound fantastic
worth a shot if youre on a budget like me
really a remarkable microphone for around 100
its for studio not live performances
has a rich warm tone like tube mics
cant beat it for the price
it isnt shrilling or peaky at all
im using it totally stock and its been great
it is as good looking in person as in the pictures
three things for the benefit of other newbs  1
you need a pa that provides 48v power to use it
other musicians were impressed by it as well
i love this boost pedal so much
the mc401 on the other hand doesnt color your tone at all
it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive
the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords
this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing
i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solidbody bass
this thing sounds completely transparent when its off and completely natural when its on
the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent
the mc401 is compacl but its heavilyconstructed so it stays put
everything is solid as a rock
i dont see how it could be better
this is a great effect
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
you will not be dissappointed at all
it gives the boost i need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever
i will always have one of these on my board
uncolored 20db of clean gain
a very good pedal that you miss only when its off
super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables
best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp
theyre great for metal if you like a durable pick
the paint fade away after a while but dont let that stop you
it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me
the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time
they stand out because everyone loves the idea of them
they look great and work well
bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law
gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick
the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping
also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing
have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time
attaches to my audio interface
didnt need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much
fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording
1 digital drumset 1 electronic guitar 1 microphone non xlr and a keyboard
i got the brady bunch musical here
all connections are 14 mono
i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings
plugged straight into my bass amp for home recordingpractice
having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere
it is lightweight and feels sturdy
input has to be kept within a small range
this is what im talking about  cheap but very usual form behringer
but i hope then would run on batteries next time
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer
bonus its an active device so it can boost the signal
i can live with that
simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all
these are amazing little inexpensive mixers
if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done
this liitle box works great for my needs
i am using three guitars on stage when possibleroom permitting
and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp
this is perfect for that
dont be surprised if it happens to you
i bought one and had the same experience
i got mine from musicians friend
light construction but  you get what you pay for
so far it has functioned well and i do use it a lot
i mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments
i have not noticed any sound degradation from using it
the volume knobs are handy for sure
what a great little gizmo
no more unpluggingplugging inbetween songs
just a push on the pedal and im switching noiselessly between guitars
i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well
hey it does its job for a cheap price
i use it put mh guitar and harp mic through the same rig
which in the end is my concern
for 2500 it a pretty useful pedal
a quick word about behringer stuff
i have several behringer pedals and other behringer equipment
i never had a problem with their stuff
this stuff is the best bargain on the market
are my behringer eurolive active pa speakers as good as my mackie srm450 speakers
i am a weekly player and have been for 40 years
i wish this stuff had been around when i first started playing
this pedal in short sucks
behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this
not exactly what i wanted
like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points
i did not need it for that
i almost sent them back
operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass
when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them
got them in 3 days
who said santa was a scrouge
for the price it cant really be beat
well what can i say
it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at hp level
i paired this up with the ma400 and it works great
id give this 1 and a half stars if i could
it is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this
i can still use this but hardly
i really dont like this
perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets
clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price
solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise
whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear
needed a boost with my headphones while playing rocksmith
item works as advertised very easy to hook up
i hooked this up to the output of my mackie mixing desk
now i can actually get on with the music  another excellent behringer purchase
the item shipped in time
the sound is very good
the only problem i had is voltage
do not let the size fool you
this is one of them
this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones
i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface
running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong
there are some annoying things about this amp
its all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn
for the money you cant beat it
this product works the way it should be
great price at amazon as usual
it is a small design amplifier and does its job very well
now all i gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah
i have to say it works very well for the price
works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect
no humhiss from these units at all
well built solid construction  zero complaints
works great  great price  meets my requirements perfectly
ive been using this product for a while now
only for indoor really light use
so i cant speak to its durability at this time
but i like it because its cheap light and it works
this box is very well made and will last a long time
the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy
i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem
individual volumes controls make it perfect
ive owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw
you wont find a better deal than this on a basic headphone ampmixer
my title says it all
i didnt like the ac adaptor
i did work very well and was strong
i liked how solid it was
the rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone
id consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 14
the real treat is the tone switch
its almost like having two stompboxes in one
the footswitch action is smooth quiet and nearly effortless
the effect is there then its not
there are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out
its hard to beat this box at any price
if the unthinkable happened id buy another one in a heartbeat
the reason i bought this one was because it was cheap
i got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool
you can get some insane sounds out of it
great sound works just like a phaser should
i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds
only thing is that it is big
one other thing it works better if you put it in front
i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great
great pedal very lush and usable tones
think lightning crashes by the band live
then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again
twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping
it gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price
for the money you cant go wrong with this effect
im using it more then i thought i would when i first bought it
easy to setup easy to use
not noisy at all really clean pedal for your board
so i figured what the heck
ive had fun with it
remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor
also its a vintage style not a mid 80s mosquito tone killing device
not a huge range here
and it does make some noise in my chain
lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteries
paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal
some other functional comments about it
it runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9volt power supply
i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter
battery life isnt super but satisfactory
still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter
the presence knob isnt a midrange control but does boost the upper mids
cons   very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days
this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries
hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off
i have a tech 21 bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs
the tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost
i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsalpractice type combos
for home use it is fine
it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amplike
this box is no exception
to my ears it sounds quite good
get it if it fills a need for you and youre broke
i still use this for practice at home
my bass is an sx jazz bass
i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp until now
after i plugged this little bad boy in it brought my amp to life
now i cannot live without it
this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps
every bass player should have one of these
for 29 bones you simply cannot beat it
if you are a bass player just buy it
its a decent unit but stopped working completely after about 6 months
tried everything i could but its gone
i would not recommend this pedal
who cares if it is plastic
dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with
second these are musical instruments
or where ever you play
the term stomp box isnt supposed to be taken literally
it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot
at less than 30incl shipping its a steal
decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di
with the wall wart no di hum  great
does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply
never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger
if broken or lostwho would steal it
id buy another in a heart beat
does as described and really enhances your tone
good breadth of tonal variations available
as another guy said 34not better not bad simply different34 its true
good deal just get it i highly recommend it
thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt
i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now
its springloaded so it comes back up by itself
i dont know if its just mine or is something inherent in this pedal
ill update this review if i ever figure it out
i just got it today and havent spent too much time with it yet
it sounded ok and i like the features on it
as soon as you press down its on
for the money its a great pedal
i am working on getting that nice way sound which ive come across somewhat
it sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords
behringer has never been very documentation oriented
ive been playing with this a lot since i got it last week
it really is versatile as well as noiseless
ive mostly used it with the default settings
really impressed with this wah
it really makes my solos rip
buy it you will have a ball
like the other reviewers on here im sad to report that its quite hissy
i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has
overall i give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars
it is a good pedal
it is not heavy and the price is good
it is a good choice for a beginner
this little guy does all it needs to do
it works nicely and for the price it was a steal
dont let the system absorbs you
this is as good as other devices that cost 34 times more
save your money and steer clear of this one
too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation
pay the extra money and get something quiet
others complained about this and they were right
if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap
some complained about each band boosting others
this is more of a user problem than manufacturing
in this respect its like an mxr 6 band
i dont have any real praise or complaints about this
i does just what it should and for the price its pretty good
yes its made of plastic but you cant expect any more for 25
the most diverse pedal i own
whatever the name this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp
id say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals
what i love about this pedal is the tone knob
for the ts pedals in this price range its the most useful
this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound
it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones
it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones
i bought this pedal to semiretire an older ibanez ts5 soundtank
the switch on that one isnt as good as the behringers
id bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt
the only downside is the slight lack of bass
if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups esp
ive now retired the boss pedal
this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail
i may buy a second one as a backup
behringer hit a home run with this one
it sounds good enough that i dont mind the lack of true bypass
what can i say that you havent already read about this amazing pedal
take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal
that alone can cause problems
as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list
you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal
i leave it plugged in on the board all the time
i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off
i carry a backup pedal
just dont ever drop it
i own the old ibanez ts9 that i modified to the original keeley specs
i laugh when ever i hear about the 34holy grail34 4558 ic chip
they send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase
the civilians wont notice the difference
i like the sound of this pedal
it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound
i have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy
i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs
the to800 gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank
behringer is a problematic company for me
across the web reviews for the to800 are uniformly favorable
this proved to be a good decision
the same sound for a lot less money
update now working got my mate an aussie genius to have a look
found pedal wasnt engaging when pushed down
worked fine with cover off then replaced cover with new bit of rubber
it gives just the right amount of crunch when needed
typical behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound
i use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern
for the money this ones a nobrainer
sounds better than the ibanez or boss models  warmer and less processedsounding
plugged into my 65 twin reverb not a reissue but the real thing wow
sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me
many seem to complain about the plastic housing but im fine with it
seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so
the pedal works as described
the draw back is the battery installation
you have to take the pedal off to access the battery
i purchased a power supply to go along with it
its ok for the money and works good
the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth
this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts808 pedal
but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for
i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player
i play for fun and relaxation
i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome
boy did i hit a home run with that
the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster
the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing
flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster
i also found that im getting better response with my guitar tone knob too
i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again
yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people
i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps
no for the nuts and bolts of the thing
dont drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime
the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate
the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly
the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker
im using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement
cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime
my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself
i got this for twenty bucks shipped
amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive
yea it was coming from vegas to ny but 10 days
15 days later it finally arrived
im pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny
all in all this is a great pedal
outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget
well everything is being returned except this pedal
more tubelike sound than a toprated tube amp
my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery
you must use a 9v transformer which is not included
dont let the cheap price fool ya
every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig
this pedal does exactly what it says its supposed to
it boosts the guitars signal
it does it really well with very little to no noise
the input signal is cleanly boosted
what you put into the input comes out the same only louder
i thought it worked great for my needs
if you use various guitars on gigs this pedal is very useful
i gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully
just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage
this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now
item body is plastic rather than metal
this is to be expected at this price
nevertheless for what it is
received this item in good time
a tricky process at best
not the easiest battery access ive ever seen
however to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable
i became relatively skilled at it in short time
initially the product didnt work
but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box
turned it down and the sound got much better
this is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range
it has excellent bass and treble tuners
jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cutout
that could be cord issues or box issues
it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment
behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why
bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price
its just soso in my estimate but in some cases soso is good enough
the item does what its supposed to
you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item
i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs
i thought it wouldve lasted a little longer
for the price i guess i shouldnt complain too much
subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with
this box is small but packs a great punch
i dont notice any difference in audio or loss in sound
the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only 20
i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio
plus the humbuzz is so loud you cant hear anything from the microphone
again its very good at what it does if you dont power the microphone
its simple  easy to use
you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want
it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me
i love my laptop a thinkpad t40
it does almost everything i need
a mono mic jack no other inputs
the behringer u control gives me stereo now
the behringer reputation pulls through once again
ive tried some usb sound cards without success
this product puts my older laptop besides newer ones
i am definitely a behringer fan
it was just what i needed to give me clean sound
all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days
bought the focusrite unit instead
save your money and time
buy the focusrite interface or one of the others
it also lacks 14 plug one rca input you need an addapter
not what i thought i was getting  dumb me
i use it with audacity
at first i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss
when i did this it completely shut out the hiss
ive been making great recordings since
for those wondering about latency obviously theres some
youll get latency with any type of recording device
it does not sound like that in the recordings though
when it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly
when you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic
then tell me what you think grin
same deal laughter of the immortals
rest assured ive voted with my feet
i own a total of five uca202s that i use in different locations
folks this is a stellar device at a throwaway price
so now that i have it i can finally record to my laptop
works perfectly with audacity and windows 7 plug and play
this little device is more than worth the money
my recording playback sounds like its live
i use a lot of behringer equipment and no i dont work for behringer
my friends say duh oh well behringer is built cheap and is junk
and i say duh huh really
in fact i use behringer xm8500 mics  3 pack for 60
i was playing a gig at a small pub
when he was done he said i love this mic
thanks behringer this is a great value
i guess it really revolves around your personal needs
for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal
this is a solid little usb interface
there are no frills and theres no latency
this particular unit seems to be built pretty well but time will tell
for the functionality alone its definitely worth asking price
expansion kit from what ive seen
there are ways to improve the offtheshelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately
the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above
i write and record my own music
i stink at writing drums
this is a great program for nondrumming one man bands like me
midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasnt cutting it
it works with ableton live 9 with no problems
it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset
2 all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit
3 the interface is clean an easy to use
you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw
i mean seriously how hard can it be
well they were right it sucks
it took me two hours to get it all working
my advice  dont even install the app from the included disc
my experience 1 try to install from disc
fails with a 13082 googled the problem
3 downloaded the 650 mb zipped installer
a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband
i like a cheese pizza
we are a perfect match pizza and me
we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom
im sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a tingting
bwoosh loop  no tingting
do i get a fortune cookie with that
its really really an amazing program
best money i ever spent
like these better then the bulkier dunlops
best straplocks i have ever had
youn name it i have tried it
these are the best topping any other by far
i have them in chrome in every guitar i own
good locks i like them better then the dunlops
i have these on all my guitars and always will
when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune
i know silly but i was not paying attention
please take a note of that
i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat
be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes
the stock tuners have one peg  these have two
despite this installing them was quite easy
they have a high build quality and work great
new strings have never been easier to install
great upgrade for squier telecasters
high quality and great design
the guitar just stays in tune now period
very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar
go with it and get a set of these
if your experience is like mine youll be very satisfied
these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele
they are certainly worth having
fenders at least americanmade ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these
ive swapped out the tuners and have never looked back
i put these on a dual humbucker usa strat
job only took about 15 minutes
excellent build and looks great
you cant go wrong with these
ive installed them on every fender i own
easy to install also and for the money give them a go
theyre just as solid as the pricier ones
and theyre fender so how can you go wrong
these really arent a very good value
the locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat
but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before
these are easy to install and simple to use
all you need is a 10mm socket and your are set
they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim
i just received these tuning machines today
the pegs line up so they drop right in
the ead are that tall capstans and the gbe are the shorter capstans
the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar
but back to the tuners
they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning
much easier and faster to change strings
i just ordered another set for my strat hss
great guitar but could certainly use these tuners
this tunners turned my normal cheap squier into a perfect squier
my guitar now stays in tune better than my prs and epiphone
the best replacement for fender tuners by far
excellent product at a righteous price
helps my guitar stay in tune
changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better
i have a set of the original locking tuners on a 84ish strat
it stays in perfect tune now
then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them
the locking mechanism is great
it acts like a vice in a woodshop project
these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune
summaryif you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time when you restring
they are just faster and easier
fresh strings can do a lot for your sound
proper use of a traditional nonlocking tuner is just as stable
for those folks these will elimiate the resulting pings and such
but their intended purpose is to speed string changes
but locking tuners are not really for that purpose
fit and installationregarding fit these have 2 little pins on the backside
pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change
maybe buy and inspect with the knowledge you might have to return them
typical neck bores for tuners by brand are shown on the warmoth site at
but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a dropin replacement
i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away
these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners
because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well
drop in replacement for both my mim and mia strat
added mass easier to tune
perfect retrofit for my 1989 american strat
the locking mechanism is strong
tuning is a breeze and is very stable
i put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less
they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster
they work like a charm
these fender locking tuners are top quality
couldnt be happier with my purchase
these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price
unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat
the quality of the locking tuners looks great
these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock
when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly
i like the look and feel of these
so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked
all in all though very good for the price
i now have these tuners on an american strat and an american tele
these were purchased on a whim
i dont find changing strings that big of a bother
these will save you a few minutes
i like them i dont love them
for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install
you will like them on the guitar
now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy
look forward to getting those crappy loose unsmooth original hardware tuners off this thing
july 20 2012 just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat
didnt have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size
i had them shipped to my business address
perfect fit  they look great
i had trouble with strings going out of tune too often
installed these fender locking tuners and voila
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them
nice and stable easy to change strings and lock tightly
always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing
really nice upgrade for your standard tuners
i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these
the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze
fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners
make changing strings a whole lot easier
just another 20 output would make these 5 stars perfect
theyre especially wonderful because theyre battery operated
these are great lights for music stands
because they are led the batteries last a long time
i am a little disappointed
i could use a brighter light
i forgot how dim led lights are
i am looking to change if i can find something else
the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey
the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to
the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing
i really dont like it
i wish i had went in a different direction
this is the neatest little light i have ever seen
and has 2 nice leds
i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable
a real needed item is you play in darker rooms
also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel 2
i have been using the behringer acx450 for six months now
i was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance
it is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects
behringers mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price
man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy
push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep
great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless
very nice effects on both channels
i am so happy with this amp
ive had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing
i highly recommend this amp
the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leatherlike material
i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market
very nice metronome with just enough features
sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off
my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it
its got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust
the tuners i have for my guitarbanjo have modes for use as a metronome
and there are two clicks to choose from
the metronome has a flashing light too
overall a very useable metronome
simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines
i do recommend this one
this probably doesnt matter to all of yall though
easy to use and quality built
i would recommend this product
when they say mini they mean it
it also has a 14 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well
even when at low volume its tones will fill a room
this is a major plus for such a tiny inexpensive amp
i expected this to come with a dc adapter
nowhere is it mentioned there wouldnt be any or i could have ordered one
the product is good surprisingly loud
i hope that doesnt happen with an adapter
its a nice little amp good for carrying around
the distortion it gives is good
not good for palm muting
also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring  and inner
i like the sound of this amp
soi f you want to turn distor t offu cannot
the mini tone master delivers well
battery life is also pretty good
while i didnt need volume this little guy can be loud
overall dimensions 6 34 x 6 12 x 2 14
sound is about what you would expect
it is basically a toy
if you use more than 2 of 10 max gain it sounds awful
tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies
is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier
actually while the amp is cheap its also fairly durable
unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally
i havent figured out which yet
that wasnt necessarily the case but there are other problems
also they are offered at 40 or 50 so its simply a better value
another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software
unquestionably the sound board was far more sensitive
i cant speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors
make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing
most of them are plastic
i bought the ebony with pearly inlay
they look great it is indeed real ebony with a pearl inlay
so they might work and they might not
they fit one of mine perfectly and another not very well
i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin 016ny
i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably
additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar
at least i know that they fit snug
thanks for the prompt and good service
i use it with my samson cl8 condenser and it is perfect
works great for podcasting vocals or anything else you want to record
the adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever it does its job well
that didnt come close to working
but this one worked perfectly
this is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment
this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319
i found instructions through a google search
the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed
instead of hammering it out i used two screwdrivers to pry it out
that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use
using my dremel tool i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit
as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove
you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible
then your oktava will fit just fine
this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting
ill post up a picture later
i found the screwon connector to not be that high quality
it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand
thats my only complaint about it
it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on
its not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing
on top of all that it looks nice too
fits mxl cube mics perfectly
sturdy and easyt to setup
while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at2020 yes
ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one
its solid helps with mounting and will be well used
fits my behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine
like it was made from the same company but its not
they must have standard fittings on mikes
does what it says it will do and it does it very well
aside from that though great product
it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe
the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still
it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters
i am very pleased with this purchase
i dont think i can say enough good things about the samson sp01 shockmount
the build quality is fantastic
nearly all do but some companies like blue snowball snowflake etc
are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts
i have used the mxl 007
usb with this shockmount as well as the at2020 usb and xlr version
the mxl fit like a glove perfect
in short i havent found a better shockmount for condenser mics
the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand
thanks samson now just make better mics
i have this paired with the behringer c1 studio condenser microphone
it matches the mic well colorwise and fit
the c1 fits the mount perfectly
i recommend this mount highly
this is a good durable mount
i like the look of it as well as the lightweight feel
not much else to be said
in short it works great the sp01 isolates the mic extremely well
this is easy to remove
all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it
once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand
it does the perfect job for podcasting as well as gameplay videos
i would recommend this to anyone
not a lot to say works great as a shockmount
i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c1s
that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well
its solid and works well
support cords seem to be of good quality
this is a quality product
super fast shiiping  through amazon as always
the product is well built easy  to use pretty straightforward
its perfect for my samson mic
i use this all the time
its pretty basic but really good for a beginner
not all chords are in here but the 34core34 chords are
this guitar tuner is such a great and useful tool
who doesnt need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right
the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesnt work very well
the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate
it gets you in the ballpark but just barely
strike a note once and its sharp
it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away
it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them
pretty precise meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy
sometimes it felt a little off but robots know best right
very compact size and easy to use
good feature for the price
very happy for this product
it works great not much i can say beyond that
i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy
that decision was based mostly on price
the attack heads that i bought though are single ply
in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively
i am very happy i did
these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance
the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated
the g2s seem to resonate everywhere
from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance
also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides
i have been using them for about 6 months
not too difficult to tune either
this is a super solid price too
i bought these to try them out
i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up
my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them
i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding
they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal
they are easier to bend too which is great
i no longer use heavier strings like i use too
these will be my mainstay
longer scales like a strat
i dont know why more people dont use these  theyre amazing
ive used many strings and owned many guitars
these arent diamonds or gretsch but theyre fantastic
i love them on my strats
the last and make playing a breeze
i dont have any tone loss between these and
these strings are beyond amazing
i thought id try these out and i loved them
so i ordered 6 more packs of these
weak sounding and break very easily
i have experimented with others but always come back to them
i just cant get enough sustain out of the high efor my taste
tried them on epi lp and a prs
for the price i got a little more than expected
the sound is pretty great
the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound
other than that your can change amount of distortion
but for the price this is one hell of a deal
but thats expected and not that big of a deal if youre careful
they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures
they are black plastic ones
still a great product though
and for the fact it was cheaper than most
im very pleased with the pedal and couldnt be happier
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them
this one is my favorite turn on and go
i think its better than the sovereign
thats doesnt leave much room for tone tweaking so tweakers beware
just leave the midswitch on the flat setting
want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good allround metal tone
move the switch down to the low midscoop mode
do you want to play master of puppets by metallica
the high midscoop mode is calling your name
you wont get a slightly fizzy ultragain think slipknot sound out of this pedal
it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultraeasy to use
although it doesnt have a tone dial it doesnt need one
it has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great
fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain
the pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus
i bought this after watching a professionallooking youtube demonstration of it
it more than lived up to my expectations
if i lost this box id immediately order another one
for the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck
my daughters love this amp and works perfect
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar
i brought for someone else
but they said they love it
so i am a happy camper i did it right
this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard
no 15watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings
every musician should have one of these around
this is a nice small amp
it delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me
i use the fender for electric and the behringer for the acoustic for practicing
makes a great little practice amp
hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music
no one hears themselves the way they sound to others
this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music
the behringer ultracoustic at108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job
i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life
the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom
that is where an amplifier comes in handy
the people who hear us only hear us through their ears
the two experiences are not the same
it can initially be a rather shocking experience
technically this at108 is at the low end of the famous behringer line
it comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plugin cabling
the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic
the natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrified
i have used it for several months with no problems
it also has a headphone output 14 inch
it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs
for me that answer is a clear yes
it is actually a good little practice amp
im still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood
it gives me the portability i needed to move about my house
i recommend this little amp wholeheartedly
i just cant believe how loud this little baby is
this little amp does everything i need for small gathering
in summary its ready to be used right out of the box
it only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy
maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise
manufacture said its for practice to me it serves the purpose
i say perfection because this amp does exactly what i wanted it to do
it is also a great value for what it does
it offers ample volume for small venues
i love having two mic inputs and the cd input
the behringer at108 along with my fender amp gives me plenty of performance capability
received promptly and tested out with acousticelectric guitar
the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way id hoped
i could not be more pleased with this product
it actually delivers much more sound than i expected
overall im really happy with this pedal
upfront the pedal sounds great
it just sounds weird and unmusical
where is this pedal now in my collection
this came at no surprise
considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds
what would i recommend you purchase
since no two distortions sound the same
personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal
the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff
the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob
which can dramatically shape the overall sound
were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line
the only issue was with some manufacturing detail
be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them
more versatile than the sovereign
some of the best aspects of the metal muff include 1
great clarity and definition even on higher gain settings
so especially for the lead guitarist this should be a major selling point
wide range to the tone controls
the quality of construction is absolutely superb
everything about the pedal is rugged and durable
id feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup
however the rocktron zombie doesnt sound good through solid state amps
sure its a bit of a onetrick pony but its a pretty good trick
not much to say about a basic bag
works for me in fact i bought another for my classical
this product is exactly what they say it is
good materialdecent paddingnice front pocketzippers function without issue
my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug
i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at homeand this works great
i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for 80
unless youre so amazing you can make it work every song
its essentially a 9v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light
they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound
i finally purchased an ebow about a year  ago
im a songwriter and record my own demos at home
i also perform live in a cover band
with practice i think this could improve
i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve this
the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound
i have only had to replace the battery once
overall i think this is a great product
the ebow is a crazy concept
its fun to use and also very challenging
comes with a velvet pouch and dvd
he clearly was good with an ebow
goes to show how diverse they are
if youve seen the youtube videos then you know what this can do
they can be switched back and forth even while youre sustaining a note
i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself
i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isnt my thing
i played it all but 2 weeks until i got bored and stopped
it now sits on my amp collecting dust
i am sorry i just cant dig it
if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it
if not your money is best spent elsewhere
they have a long range and great sound fidelity
works ok for the price and features it is fine
get the batteries it did not came with any
i am using it for a dj karaoke system i do recommend it
got the mics from dealer fast
i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound
this microphone works well for our needs
it could be from shipping
i reattached the item and added a windscreen
now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore
this worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet
sound was good and it was easy to set up
good for the price and no regrets
bought these for home karaoke and they work great
i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally
pros price pointgood clean audio quality when working
it was not dropped or abused in any way
for the price you can not beat these
this is a great buy
just a bag for my guitar stand
this takes care of that problem for a couple of bags
sturdy material nice draw string to close it up
shoulder strap works just fine
i love these carry bags
who couldnt use an extra arm or two when moving equipment
well made and a fair price too
do you have a hercules guitar stand
then this will make transporting it easy
ok quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic
tis makes it a little awkward to carry
if you use all four fingers buy two sets
im used to conventional steel finger picks
however these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly
sounds like a great concept and they seem well made
i just dont care for them
i know others love them so i guess its just a personal thing
it took weeks to receive them in the us
dont be in a rush
i love the open feel from these picks
its almost like picking with with just your fingers except with more volume
propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar
compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal
highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar
dont know what the delay was but it took forever to get here
bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me
i can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail
these are working a lot better for me
i used alaska picks for years which are very good
if you play with nails and want finger picks these are for you
excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage
these microphones have a qualityfeel to them and they all worked perfectly
i used them with my harbinger ha60 pa system and i was not disappointed
they dont come with cables so be sure you have some available xlrxlr
you can get a 25 cable for under 5 also here on amazon
would not hesitate to purchase more of them if i need to
they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great
we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time
i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup
a wise choice for the budget conscious
everything was good except for that one microphone
i use them as room mics mainly for which they perform admirably
ive only used them once for backup vocals and the results were good
would recommend these for folks on a budget
also the case is nice
made of all metallooks and feels well made
3 great vocal microphones in its own protective case with its own holders
but for general purpose use and abuse
sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs
the 3pack is a fantastic deal
good lows and clean highs without any hiss
absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp
dont miss out on this great deal
for the price i dont think i could have done better
dropped one a few times and its still working
on off switches on each
i record to daw and the recordings sound fine
the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel
seems like theyll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us
i love these microphones i really do
3 for under 40 was fantastic
i am glad i didnt break budget here
im using these with the behringer 1202fx mixer
i am so extremely happy with them
these microphones are great for recording vocals
they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds
they do not have any detectable noise or issues
i use these at parties and they work good for the price i paid
i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings
sensitivity is good and im very pleased by this purchase
you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case
however if youre just doing it as a hobbyside job
better than the nady starpower mic i also bought from amazon
this item was received well packed and on time
my band had no pa or mics or anything
not much distanceyou have to 34eat34 the micsbut the sound is great
full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound
this is a great place to begin
comes in a really nice case
cant speak to durability because havent had them long and havent used them heavily
i was looking for a financially good deal
well they were a great investment
when i told them the price they thought i was pulling there leg
the case is plastic foam and clips
three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself
id buy these again in a heart beat
i just might buy another 3pack
some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic
id rather lose one of these behringers than a 58
sound wise these are great for their intended purpose
if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain
i bought them at 45 dollars
use for small music gigs and djmc uses
i recommend for use of  1
small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practicesrehearses etc
for the price i paid cant beat what i got
have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them
order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring
two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up
i will no longer use other humidifying methods for my br243a
i have four of these  and will continue to use this product
i own several taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars
you can tell when theyve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling
it means they need to be replaced
i get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack
with the humidpak you have a lot more security
i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it
ive been playing for about 15 years and have always used a humidifier
this works just as good as anything else
keeps my case at a nice 6070 humidity
i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too
just to make sure you have the proper humidity level
well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water
these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier
they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gellike feeling
so i am convinced that they work now
i bought this for my taylor 714
it seems to keep things humidified very well
i have replaced packs twice
they are easy to use
you take the packs and put them in the sleeves
there is a double sleeve and a single sleeve
it has worked so far
they say 24 months ive never come close to even a month
if it sounds too good to be true it usually is
i bought this for my new 12 string guild acoustic
i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them
and with 12 strings it really put a lot of tension on them
another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves
they should last 34 months  you dont do anything else
also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock
i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also
i think it almost doubled in price a week after i ordered
packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use
one star short of a 5 star review
the price for the replacement packets
other than that a wonderful system
that was good enough to sell me
but when the humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements anyway
these replaced the etb92 nylon tapewounds i tried
my bassplaying has gone on for 50 years
and during the time ive tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars
this set of daddario chromes is remarkable
in this set i especially like the 4th string at
this string is not muddy sounding like many flat wounds
clean bold and full of smooth overtones that work well
i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar
so i put these on my 1978 musicman stingray bass
but i wanted more of a standup doghouse bass sound like early basses had
but i loves me my musicman
and i love the sound of these strings
as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy
but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good
otherwise 5 star all the way
then a friend told me hed switched from the thomastiks to these
he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well
im now a convert too
i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass
as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired
with fretted basses id always liked strings with a little brassiness
but roundwounds just didnt feel or sound right on a fretless
small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction
and roundwounds just didnt have that acoustic sound
these flatwounds were a perfect choice
theyve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings
the bass sounds more like a real bass
and the action is now so smooth
there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds
as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home
those strings made it hard to play so i tried these daddario mandolin strings
i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound
i tweaked the action and the 010s are fine and ive made the adjustment
are just about all the same
but ill be going to coated strings next
the coated ones are medium which is too heavy for me
i8217m really glad i did
the tone is great they8217re durable and smooth on the fingers
they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels
you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock
they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate
thanks d8217addario for providing an awesome product
they may be more than the mando needs
great sound over the original strings
i did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size
the g and the d were fine
the strings are slightly smaller than the j74 and deliver a great sound
several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound
my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try
so i just got this product havent used it
these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing
playing went from painful to pure pleasure
for that i gave four stars instead of five
these strings are well packaged and easy to unroll and string on my guitar
my seagull now sound mellow with brightness
also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it
these daddario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking
i like these strings for their warm  mellow tone
they are easy on the fingers and i prefer the silverwound basses
i have an alvarez yari acoustic guitar that i absolutely love
here is the gorgeous tone i had missed
i am now on my second set of strings and i am hooked
i bought this to replace an actual fullout pa and was very pleasantly surprised
pros  great price very loud as well as clear
also compact and very durable
bottom line  as a monitor look no further
i use it as a pa for practicing and it is a godsend
i needed to run my boss gt100 and vocals through it on stage
it is built extremely wellvery solid and sounds incredible
the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing
simply fantastic piece of equipment
in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient
i have run both aroland rd300nx digital pianoandroland vcombo vr700
vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular
that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances
there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand
i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes
that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip
i like the sound quality i get
if i used it a with a passive guitar pickup id want external preamp
perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle colored
i wont have to listen to them
another tip   get a copy of yamahas sound reinforcement handbook
this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours
seems like it is part of the design
totally unusable as far as im concerned
didnt purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good
is it a completely authentic acoustic sound
check out some youtube tests before buying
i zero the spring verb and use the pedals onboard reverb for best results
sounds good with both guitars  especially neck and center positions
to do so youll see a black knob at the base of the pedal
just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery
overally solid pedal as youd expect from boss
when i run it alone to my crate i havent experienced this
never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp
not sure how a nonpiezo pickup would affect the tone
if you want to get the right effect this is a good choice
for those of us who find acoustic guitars difficult to play this is solution
dont use the bridge pickup as it doesnt sound too good
its amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electroacoustic guitar
the boss ac3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator
the ac3 does that job
although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful
the key to using this pedal is using it correctly
first and foremost  use single coils
tested with a les paul with burstbucker pros the hiss was overwhelming
point two  any form of gain will create a ton of hiss
the ac3 is not a set it and forget it pedal
summaryacoustic sounds 34ok34 but noisy in weird ways
price seems high for what it is and vs
variety of acoustic sounds possible
details the basic concept is good
it was also just noisy in the pedal chain
adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some
at the time the ac2s were selling for about 85 new
boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac3
but not enough to keep it
i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead
they make two  a 3430034 and a 3440034
the 400 has reverb on the pedal
i opted for the 300 and got it for 25
i also have a boss gt100 multieffects unit
if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it
this boss pedal just didnt work that well for me
as with all boss  roland products the boss fs6 performs as designed
everything works exactly as planned
i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries
the possibilities are limited only to your imagination
it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product
if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs6
built like a tank and completely configurable
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac33 acoustic amp
however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate
this is totally unnecessary for a footswitch
i bought it to use with my boss me70
i hear it can be used on other boss and roland gear
other than that its perfect
could be more tapered for such a tiny pick
but the material is awesome
nice grip even more so when i sweat
second time i bought these
a bit small for my preference
great for picking kind of harsh for strumming  quality seems topnotch
some guitarists will love these
once you get used to the small size there is no going back
the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator
five stars for being a better jazz iii
however the prices for these on amazon are absurd
i got mine through musiciansfriend for around 2 shipped
idk why gc does not carry these
firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip
once you try these picks you never go back
this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to
great picks not just for jazz though
i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles
i decided to try them out
and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks
sooo i figured why not have a go at it
i was skeptical about this 34impossible to drop34 thing which i read
so i was dieing to feel them
it was like there was no pick
to me thats just freaking incredible
i love this thing love it love it
i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different
the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed
i replaced a bone noncompensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this
a little careful sandingpolishing and the guitar was ready to play
this left the saddle too low to the neck
ill do this to my other acoustics as time goes on
the difference is quite noticeable and good
i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements
in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder
this is not worth the money
i did have to sand to make it fit
that may sound badm but i am glad because its better than too small
i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering
replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl
good sound quality for not being bone
this was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions
tusq saddles and nuts are the best synthetic out there
all my stringed instruments have been fitted with tusq parts
i installed this saddle in my silvertone sd10
if you have a lower end guitar this will make a huge difference
i had to sand it down some in all directions
i did the length first then thickness and finally the height
i used 220 grit sandpaper
the directions are in the package
this is a great product just not for me
gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end
and the sound expanded beyond my expectations
i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade
i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love
i decided to replace the saddle with this one
and it required some dremelingsanding to get it to sit correctly
this one is an ivoryish color and it is really nice
installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster
012s and this is one of my prize acoustics now
the jig method is super easy and provided great results
kk you have a convert in me
i am now thinking about trying this on my martin
i installed this pickup myself
when i tested it out i was blown away
just like my taylor only louder
the true test was an actual live performance
i brought my baggs para acoustic di and i was glad i did
i could not believe it
it literally gave me chills
if youre on the fence about this pickup go for it
its a great buy in my opinion
i have kk pickups in other guitars
this is the first one ive bought that had the smaller transducers
it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers
like other kk pickups it sounds darned good
it makes placement a snap
they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup
i put this in a 200 guitar
so i popped in this kk
i ran it through my swr california blonde ii acoustic amp
this pickup sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically
it does pick up percussive noise which you dont get with under saddle pickups
im sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar
ive read that folks prefer the kk over the madeforthegsminitaylorpickup
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound
i will have to replace it soon
some peope miss the 34quack34 electric guitar type sound from these other types
i run it through a baggs paraacoustic preamp or my fishman aura
product was delivered safely and promptly
but you cant expect to just plug it in and go
youll need a feedback buster and a good preamp
but it really does the job good tone
the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion
you may be careful around it but its hard to say for others nearby
at the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars
this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand
it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly
this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand
no buttons levers or knobs
i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter
either that or theyre comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue
still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed
i got this to plug into my computer
it comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos
the quality and durability are there 100 well worth what i paid for
i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband
my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one
it works but the levels are too low
it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional
id say the level is beginnerintro level sound and quality
i bought a 34like new34 product describing faded or damaged packaging
behringer gave me a link to download
i assure you its crapware and beware
for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use
i couldnt even get the software to load on my 2013 imac
use this to record my guitar on garage band
works and sounds really good
this product has turned out to be great with few exceptions
plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor
you must use the headphone jack on the interface
once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product
quality german manufacturing as always
i would definitely recommend this
it worked with my windows 7 starter acer netbook
the ucg102 runs on an asio driver
you do receive two other software options with the device
the first is energyxt2 which i believe includes a license for the compact version
the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments
so far this has been the most impressive of the options offered
firstfinding a driver to use was a pain
my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this
i use this cable a lot and it has stood the test of time
if it matters to you the white ends are very well white
this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal
maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable
i like this cable for it has an angled plug
it is not that long but no complaints
it works as it should and does well
i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp
not too much to say about a cable
it worked out of the box
i use some threadlock on them
i find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things
i use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp
believe this 5 feet cable is no small thing
the jacks are high quality construction
the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable
i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years
im glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available
works great and to me its cheap
cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable
the wire could be a little heavier but you cant beat the value
the plugs are the standard screwdown type with well soldered  joints
i would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet
5 feet is a weird length for a cable
just dont wander too far off
i feel chained to my workstation
get a 10 foot and be free
these cables are very good
these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums
they appear to hold up well under constant moving
i will be getting more
the heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well
i recommend tightening the housing because everyone of mine were loose
this cable seems topnotch to me
some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting
of course those guys abuse their equipment
this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and id buy another
it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself
this includes taking the time to store them for use
2 make sure you know what length you need for a cable
the shorter the cable the better for studio use
if you need a longer cable buy a longer cable
what more can you ask for
i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back
i dont expected nothing better this is just right
glad i chose to purchase this cable
bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor
these have good shielding not like the others
i will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp
the quality is great price is right and delivered on time
this is a great cable at a good price
i works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables
i have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable
this cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp
this is good for the money
it is short but works with the small amp that i purchased
these are good quality cables at an economical price
the difference between hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable
the cable shipped fast and i couldnt be more pleased
in fact i dont think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours
one step on the cord and it came apart
this purchase is the very reason why im looking to buy a wireless system
maybe if youre using this to run a pa i would recommend it
but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldnt recommend this item
but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer
youll end up saving money over the long haul
this little cable gets used on my practice amp
i love the 90 degree connection
the overall quality seems good and i have had no problems
i often use my electric guitar unplugged
when i am plugged in i dont move around a lot
so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing
but no hum or noise and seems solid
i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage
one for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great
i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp
this runs from my guitar to the pedal
this is great for adding pedals
been using it for a month or 2 now
angled end is a good fit
they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock
i have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars
i came across these grovers
they had good reviews and the price was right
took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and restring the guitar
the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever
they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced
nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug
i like them and glad i purchased them  so far
i installed these on my 2000ish epiphone les paul
they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look
i used a 38 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully
lee oskar harps are the best value
the hohner special 20 just seems to have this little extra
both harps very bendable etc
as for the replaceable reed plates
amazon has this harp marked down to about the 25 level
reed plate replacements are about 19
i figured he could start simpler
it has a great tone
i am sure this will give him years of entertainment
this is not a toy  a great addition to your mouth harp collection
the secondposition for the harp in c is g not terribly common
that song along should keep my practicing for a long time
this is a really cheap microphone
it sounds like a cheap mic
for the price however you should not expect any better
this is essentially a toy
maybe you want a 34lofi34 sound
you could make it work
overall this is a really good bargain for an extra backup or kids mic
it is not a horrible mic
it is usable for applications like speaking
for hifi music recording however youll notice it is a cheap mic
good quality for the price its a mic on a stand
is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet
but it is perfectly adequate for most purposes
and youre gonna do that right
good quality for the price
i still tried it with a difference mic
i was impressed at how much of is isnt plastic
i cant recommend this product
i feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing
it works great thank you nady and amazon
its compact and great to use
my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand
it comes with a cord that has a standard 14 inch end
i plugged it into a small guitar amp
they use it mainly to sing along with their cdsmp3s
in that regard i give it five stars
the stand is sturdy too
the mic has loud voice in my karaoke
the stand makes my setting professional
you feel different when there is a stand holding the mic
this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements
the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality
this is not a great quality microphone
i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school
i need some less expensive equipment to play on
so it works well for that
you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters
these arent the dirtcheap  these actually have some nicer connectors  midgrade level
decent cables and arent too expensive
gls audio 25ft mic cable is very high quality
you will not be disappointed
i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events
for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables
this are a great value for your buck
the only thing i didnt like about these
if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you
second time buying the 6 pack  great deal for the price
i love having the colored cables makes set up so easy
i also like the xlr connectors on these havent had one go bad yet
these cables are very good quality
i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage
they are good quality and very durable
these cables are great in microphone or dibox applications
they are clean of any electrical noise
having color coded cables are also good too
its the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
of course the color coding is a godsend
still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased
ill also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision
i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space
this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system
the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed
what more can i say
gls makes a great product for musicians on a budget
these cables are solidly made affordable and really easy to differentiate on a mixer
i have become a fan of gls
we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices
for the price this is totally worth it
i used a different color cable for each function
i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards
all of the cables worked perfectly
i cant believe i never thought of buying colored cables before
theyve been stepped on and treated pretty rough
they are still supple and easy to wind up
very inexpensive yet reliable cord
this is the best pricevalue purchase ive made in a long time
the sound guy thought it was an sm 58
this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound im looking for
i used to buy all shure productsim switching to gls
this is a great mic
out of the box it has a nice weight to it
i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well
i dont work for the company or have any ties whatsoever
im just a dude in a band
trust me on this one
the 57 version is also like its shure counterpart
great sound and great deal
i plan on getting a few more of these
i bought this because it was cheap and figured it cant be that bad
i was surprised that it was good
to my ears this is a sm58
ha amazon rejected my first review because i mentioned a competitor by name chickens
these cables are good xlr noisefree cables
i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service
great folks to deal with
the quality is good the smell was funny when first opened
these are great xlr cables
we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent
i have several gls cables and have zero complaints
the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad
i have had multiple mistakes and frustrations
imho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording
it doesnt have much value on your belt clip
still have my effects rack
i scored a virtually unused preowned unit for 50
i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals
does that make me a gear snob
i just prefer analog all the way around
the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones
the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied
the effects are hit and miss as well
i considered a few different brands and even other line 6 pod models
and i still dont sound like alvin lee
before you dive into the presets
its a fact of life
ive never found it to be excessive
turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when youre not playing
multivoltage capability for worldwide use powering eight pedals and very cost effective too
if i bought eight adapters it would cost me well over 120 usd
even at the price its sold at the build quality is pro level
id be happy using this on a welltraveled pedalboard
i usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session
i can crank em all if i want to and go nuts
im not sure id use it for professional gigs but great for home use
if you are thinking about buying this product do it
if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chart
power to the pedals rock on
one spot has become the standard
it is not cheap but it is well made and useful
2 thumbs up and 5 stars
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together
i have an maudio black box which had a peculiar size plug
it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit
i would recommend having it around just for that
this seems like a good product
too long is better than too short
bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc
has all the adapters i needed
easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip
well worth the price of the product
if you need it theres enough wiring to have space between your pedals
this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues
i have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great
looks pretty neat along with the george ls cables that are almost invisible
the 1 spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz
im using this with five pedals and it works great
i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires
this is a great set
all youll need to get your pedal train wired and running
i dont get any hum and it powers what i need it to
a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power
neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply
but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy
best to have a noise gate handy
ive been using this item for about 3 weeks now and i love it
no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldnt handle the load
i still have open leads for those other pedals
id read a lot about the one spot power system
i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this
it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet
i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards
i may swamp them out fo this one
makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy
good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply
quite a few people are complaining about the buzz causedinduced by this
at first i thought it was the noise suppressor
but even when its off im getting absolutely no buzz from my effects
for the price this is amazing
the cables are very long maybe too long if thats possible
if youre even thinking about buying this just buy it already
would i use it on stage or in the studio
would i prefer something nicer if  werent an issue
does this wok great on a budget absolutely
if youre tired of using batteries pick this thing up
easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path
the extra adapters are a nice touch
get one youll be happy you did
this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings
no need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters
for a modest rig or on the road use i recommend this product
this is now powering my entire effects board and its doing a great job
the product works very well im able to power 5 of my pedals easily
ive been using this product for months now and have no complaints
you cant beat the price
i use it every gig now no problems
the leads are actually a little too long but thats a good thing
this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized
all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in
versus the godlyke id say this is the better purchase
i only wish it came with two of them
one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply
it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks
its so bad i just cant use it at all
im not sure about a transistor amp
sometime round 1994 my friend kendal built several of these for our band
they were great and incredibly handy
certainly if he did he never patented it or anything
this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters
so far it has lived up to my expectations
so for such a simple device you really cant beat it
unless you dont really use boxes
a real money saver a very smart buy
it works perfect with my boss pedals
no buzzes no hums no nonsense
its just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals
save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this
im so glad my friend introduced me to this product
this bundleincluding an 8pedal chain a few adapters and the power supplydoes it all
in fact it may be overkill
and the adapters never used em
but it is a complete kit
if you need more than this i dont know what to tell ya
say good bye to batteries
this is very affordable too given the high number of effects it will supply
i could find nothing better on the market for the price and features
the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and its awesome
real cost saver on batteries
you really cant go wrong for the price
this is a terrific product
the key to the onespot is the 1700ma output
by comparison the boss psa120 adapter puts out 200ma
i use it with boss and ibanez pedals and it works great
powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc
even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal
also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip
takes up less room on your pedal board
also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables
the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss
it can put out up to 1700ma
which is how it can run up to 8 pedals
a great item at a great price
no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more
great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board
the distance between the plugs is sometimes too short
getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended
may not power some pedals that have a high current draw
i have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them
much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries
im always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs
this is easily adjustable and adds a depth and a nearleslie sound
i have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time
i got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect
but either way i liked it and decided to keep it
its a really good deal at the price
and it sounds just as good as major brands
the only problem most people find is the material that its made of
its like a hard plastic not metal like most are
but for live playing its great
its especially perfect for garage and bar bands
it can do subtle lowrate lowdepth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles
it will still hold up with moderate use
summarygreat pedal buy it youll probably keep it
at its price point  5 stars
only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds
latchedunlatched mode  the best feature on the pedal
probably not needed on this pedal
two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability
no good out of the boxplug it nothing
no way to send it back im not from the states
i just wasted away 40 something bucks add shipping
well ill man up and buy something else
great pedal for the money get it
for guitar bass or keys
ive used the fx600 for a couple of years
for this price i cant see why anyone would not like this pedal
although i ordered three of them
this should be your first pedal
for 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion
no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck
its clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife
this is an amazing pedal
delay  flanger phaser  tremolo  pitch shifter
all sound really good and completely adjustable
for the price this is a steal
if you buy this definitely havebuy a 9v adapter with a  polarity
behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality
i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them
the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence
needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget
i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand
fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume
dont spend 200 on a boutique pedal  get this one
again i am more than satisfied
for someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal
i think youll be pleasantly surprised and you sure cant beat the price
a great value for your money
i am a beginner guitar player
i have a yamaha f335bl and a hohner hc06
the sound is also really good its very resonant and just sounds 34good34
it is hard to describe the sound you woul dhave to hear it
ive been playing for about 17 years
most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga
i wanted a third guitar just for kicks
id been looking a taylors but didnt want to spend that much money
so i did a little research
my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s6 and i really like it
im also going to put on some elixir light strings
i dont know what kind of strings are on it out of the box
im glad i bought it
this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first
the top is natural cedar
as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down
weight is pleasantly light and the semigloss finish is comfortable to the touch
overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume
buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer
it is a real standout in value
i am considerng replacing my takamine minijumbo with a seagull equivalent
although not through amazoncom i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar
seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width
i couldnt be happier with the seagull s6 especially for the price
the satinfinished cedar top is very easy to marr
the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy
the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok
i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle  nice
seagull to me is overhyped
i personally think this seagull is over rated
oh by the way i have an s6 for sale
i bought this guitar in 2005
it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way
this model has the cedar top
i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars
yes this guitar has an oiled finish
this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded
it also allows you to knock the heck out of it
i think youll like this guitar enough to not knock it around
the neck feels silky smooth
i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago
update  10132012 update of my 2010 review
this guitar sounds even better
to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior
yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of
it will increase in value to you at least
im more blues orientated now and love it at the end
unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq
this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost
the result is an amazing clean boosting eq
if youre on the fence
go ahead and get this thing
is a great way to change the sound of your guitar
it has more flexability than just a tone knob
product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller
this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies
when inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage
ive had this pedal since the mid90s when i started playing in my teens
since i have better equipment now i havent used it as much
however as simple as it is it is definitely a useful tool
again nothing that cant be fixed with other effects
ill have this thing forever
i like it its ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion
if you like warm sounds you should see something else
amazing the besti cant believe
this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words
bought this distortion pedal for our son
who plays his electric guitar daily
he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use
but he loves it and i guess thats all that matters
very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep
well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals
it has great sound and distorts like its suppose to
i have been needing one for a long time
sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss pedal
i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one
dont let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you
this is an awesome pedal
you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours
as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price
i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables
i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely
very useful for connecting rack components between
great idea in different colors
i will buy it again
i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment
they are well made reliable and cost effective
the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light
first the size is perfect in my rack configuration
what makes these a bargain is construction
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
this came today and i must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly
my takamine acousticelectric fits perfectly and is very stable on the stand
i have 100 confidence this will never tip over on its own
youd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over
anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill
this is built like a tank and should last a lifetime
the stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport
its a stand it does what its supposed too
that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable
i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only
id prefer a better stand however i question its existence
nice and stable for my classical guitar
this is a good stand
using this for a prs electric guitar with satisfactory results
sturdy enough for repeated use
no worries about using this with an expensive instrument
simply put its well made and works great
unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand
the construction itself is ok
bottom line you get what you pay for
i will need to look for something else
as a matter of fact i ordered 2 more
get this one and have no regrets
i neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect
ordered a few of these
should come in different sizes
but for the price these are fine
keep em in every case
works great with or without polish
surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable
works well with polish on natural wood instruments
it is just as describedi am happy
amazon always comes throughwithout a hitchit was delivered as usual before stated time
it works well with cleaning spray
it works and it is relatively inexpensive
awesome little untreated polishing cloth
they clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced
awesome product to keep your axe looking great
i bought these xlr cables for my mobile dj rig and they perform flawlessly
the contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality
colors help keep track of what is going into where
and the build quality is solid
i was warned about the shielding but i havent experienced an issues yet
ive used gls products before and they are good quality for a fair price
their microphones do a great job for little cost
these cables didnt disappoint me either
dont judge their products on price alone
you will be pleased and your bank account will thank you
the construction of this set is superb
i did buy some more expensive magami ones and i cant tell a difference
have used them for months with no failures
decent quality ends and build
they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed
they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end
i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life
very happy with these cables
just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job
well made and look and feel sturdy
even came with a couple of velcro straps
the ends seem to be well made
dont hear any anomalies in the audio
xlr cables are hard to mess up
the best xlr cables you can find
ive bought much more expensive cable that didnt have the quality of these
they even had velcro reuseable tape to hold them 2 each
these balanced patch cables are great
love their xlr microphone cables too
ok 6 trs patch cables 6 long each for 3000
update   i just received another set of these cables
im extremely happy with the build quality and performance
ill be looking at additional items from this company
they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus
for the price and selection and results works for me
the title says it all
there is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive
ive been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems
if youre looking for some good trs cables
they look nice and do the job perfectly well
the price is not too bad
the colours help with organization
the fulltone full drive 2 is another incarnation of the original fulldrive
not to mention boutique quality at a working mans price
this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish
it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board
holy buckets of tone batman
let me start by saying im always on the quest for great amazing tone
i think it ends here
this pedal is absolutely remarkable
built like a tank im pretty sure it will out live me
its full of sonic options
the overdrive has a level tone and overdrive
it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes
yes this may be another tube screamer clone but its a darn great one
another great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v18v
this pedal wont be leaving my board probably ever
if youre even thinking about it just do it
so far so good with this pedal
nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated
you gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up
this pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds  and is very versatile
i would purchase another if i needed it
this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal
its go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel
with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound
on the other side you cant use boost channel without drive channel
guitar bag fit over my fender t bucket guitar
cheap price and does the job
havent used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected
im a new user but seem to be a great product
i finally got it and saw how great it is
exactly as described in the ad
this bag is made well enough
if you are careful it offers good protection
im very happy when i got this gig bag
good quality and thik cussion
good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind
best price with free shipping
finish your serch and buy this one
this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar ok
doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though
it pretty much does what its supposed to
so you plug it and its ready to use
its pretty fast and accurate for its price
overall its good enough to buy it
no problems with it at all
for the money you cant get one that touches it
so what if its not 100
that means you have more green stuff to buy other things
every guitarist needs a good tuner
and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products
the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend 90100usd for a tuner
they all work the same
just gettit if u are in a budget
i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times
look at what it does and what it costs
yes the housing is made of plastic
if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive
and if it doesnt so what
the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens
one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair
i own three other behringer pedals as well and theyre still going strong
this is not a gigging pedal
seems great need more time to explore what it can do
i may need new cables
use with power supply and not batteries
so far this cable has worked very well
it has had no issues at all
for the money you cannot even make your own
cables are good my only complaint is the connectors
i guess thats because they are cheap
very good price and good performance
no wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category
a little flimsier than the at but at the price its good
great price but very fragile
im a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables
in my experience these cables were not great
i cant expect miracles at that pricepoint but i certainly expected better
i avoid this brand of cables
double bass pedal has a quality build
easy to build and breaksdown for transport
solid attachment to bass drum
easy to adjust with reversible mallets
as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value
i bought this for my sons 7th birthday
he badly needed an upgrade from his ludwig jr kits bass pedal
5 stars because of the price and what i was expecting to get
i wasnt expecting pro level gear for a sub 100 pedal
wow  it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities
this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset
it has to feel right
tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again
this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
i really really recomend this one
you can dial it right in to get that srv sound
very sturdy and very well made
a must have for any blues player
for the money this is a tremendous pedal
by the way bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one
maybe the maxon made version
i doubt there is that much difference
it is great and i kinda like the great look
you really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit
it has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks
if you need a tube screamer
you cant go wrong with the ts9
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
it just might not be your sound
the construction is sturdy metal and actually heavierfeeling than a boss pedal
but lets be clear what a tube overdrive pedal is and isnt
this is not a distortion petal like the boss ds1 or metal zone mt2
it is not meant for heavy rockmetalgrunge type music
it also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose
yes this is a great overdrive
this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives
my verdict  awesome  it sounds just like i remember
it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound
this pedal has three preamp settings  ts9 hot  and turbo
its great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar
if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound
if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by bossroland
the tube screamer just works
if you need a tube screamer
you cant go wrong with the ts808
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
it just might not be your sound
distortion pedals go much better with solid state
however the ibanez ts9dx does more than your typical tube screamer
but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem
i like the  setting the best
so its basically like adding another channel to my amp
and you cant dial it out
the regular ts9 mode adds some low mids and a little more high mids
and yes this pedal will do that
this unit is like a old blue jeans
problaly exist betters pedals but its produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything
i am a tone freak
at the time i had never owned a big muff
i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound
consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top
that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does
unfortunately thats about all it does
describing its sound with words helps but doesnt really do it justice
theyre one of my very favorite effects honestly
it uses a normal 9v adapter jack thank you finally
yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue
some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has
its better in every way than the ny reissue
also it costs less money
this is a well built and high quality product
it provides great sustain and distortion
the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well  it delivers massive fuzzplussustain
it is simple to use though and it makes a lot of noise
this is an interesting limited effect pedal
i bought it mainly to use with my nonpedal steel guitar
its sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works
i tried this with regular guitar but its not the same
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought
its a cool pedal especially considering its price but dont be fooled
all this pedal does is perform volume swells
think of it as a supplumentary effect
to the point where its nonexistent
the rest will just play as if the effect was off
other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss
no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min
the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure
power adapters are your friend
oh that reminds me the casing is plastic
however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend
it was not what i wanted
ive never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few
out of most ive tried ive come across the big muff the most
thats what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in youtube
not to mention the bargain basement price
fuzz 1 is a creamy midrange filled sound
this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick
i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay
it seems to work best with power chords root5th note and single notes
fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff
it has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister
with the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here
this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1 so it buzzes longer
head era korn comes to mind for me
the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile
this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level
overall i like the tones this pedal spits out
id still not abuse them too much though
you cant go wrong with the bright blue led either
its cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much
nice features on a pedal this cheap
i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass
switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal
for this price its another great tool for your arsenal
there is such a thing as too much
youll find it in this pedal
i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss
real good variation from full out rat like to not so much saturation
the treble and bass control make huge sound differences
its plastic so dont jump on it
for me this pedal was a great way to do that
for me this pedal gets you 80 of the way there
it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls
none of the problems onoff that plague the cry baby
people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix
but this is the original and the best
well long story short this is my fourth vox wah
so far so good not perfect but good
i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item
it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows
the chrome on the sides looks very cool
makes it look really smart
the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom
its a wah and wah and does just that
because when its switched on without the battery theres no sound coming from it
correct me if im wrong
its different sounding from the crybaby wah
you should listen to both to know which is right for you
i wanted the tales of brave ulysses sound so i went with this
i have many heavy guitars
yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers
however my back was still hurting and im definitely a weakling
so i bought this shoulder pad
really though its quite good
the padding is comfortable but slightly heavy velcro flaps make installation easy
i found that it just added more weight
i would look elswhere for a different product
this strap is very comfortable
like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros
adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar
it doesnt stay where you need it
slips down becuase of wieght
get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar
i own over a dozen overdrive pedals
i know that is just insane
this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard
i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads
it does a great job
after researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever i chose the fulltone ocd
the reviews on amazon helped as well along with youtube demos and guitar mags
okay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive
much better than trying to rolloff the volume
the truebypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged
as of now this is my favorite piece of gear
if youre looking for massive distortion keep looking
but this will be my go to bluesrock pedal for quite some time
pluck a string and let it sit and it slowly cleans up
thats the sound ive been looking for out of this amp
if the amp couldnt do it naturally when it comes to dirty tone
then its the wrong amp
i have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my strats
but this pedal gives me everything that i want
the ocd gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone
the hplp switchshifting into hp is almost like a gain boost
i guess this is a decent description
it feels like you get a boost in your midrange
first a word about the negative reviews
2012 were all 5star reviews
i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost
now lets talk about how the pedal sounds
its marketed as an overdrivedistortion
i like a lot this pedal
its has a deep overdrive
im using 18vdc to supply power and it deliverys a fat overdrive
im using a ts808 in front of ocd
just two controls one for volume one for compression
i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim
very little instructions at all actually
it also has a substantial treble boostlow cut going on
even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end
it is quite bright sounding
though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own
the led is really bright
this was exactly what i needed this being the 3rd compressor i bought
great price sturdily built great compressor effect
seems like i found a winner
for 2400 this compressor does just what its supposed to do
its a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works
no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings
great simple pedal clean sound
update  i have had this pedal now for about 1 12 years
i have to admit that this is true
its not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable
try the behringer cs400 for more sustain
i would put this pedal in that category
so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal
not the same as a mxr so dont get your hopes up on that
bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction
got the danelectro wall wart for it
the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for
perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily
i love these picks they are my favorite
i bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year
these picks are sturdy and wont break that easily
i use them for rhythm runs and even lead
they are perfect for rhythm flexible
my only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold
for lead these sound dull
i much prefer a brighter more chimey sound
either they feel good in your hand or they dont
either they kind of 34disappear34 when youre playing or they feel like a hindrance
these dunlops get it just right
and its a great price buy them
almost a perfect pic for me
just wish it was more like a fender pic finish
that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better
hands down my absolute favorite pick
between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered
but within 10 minutes of using it itll stick with you much better
i always keep a lot of these on hand
the weight is great for my style of playing
they seem more durable than other brands
i love em use them daily and rely on them
these picks are great the best part is the 72 pack
ive been using dunlop tortex picks for years with the
73 being my mainstays for acoustic  electric picking
still they play so well its worth the cost of regular replacement
i own a few of them
sure you can spend more on a slide but i see no reason to
i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size 8
this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric
this one produces a great tone and is wellmade
for general home use though i wouldnt worry about it too much though
the glass is a much softer more subtle sound than metal
it works on my pinky finger
just dont drop one of these on you tile floor
they explore quite nicely that way
i keep mine in a protective case when i am not using it
dont know why i didnt buy this years ago
they are always good quality
price with amazon prime is a good buy
i think i already mentioned something about it being sturdy
whether you get brass or glass is your preference
as long as you dont drop it all the time it should be ok
definitely recommend this slide especially for its price
a must for every serious guitar player
this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide
i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger
i will order a smaller size
i am trying to learn a few slide riffs
for what its supposed to do it works very well
this is still usable but it is for very big fingers
either way it works well
it feels very sturdy and im not worried about it cracking anytime soon
for the price its a must have
i bought this along with a clayton large glass slide
this slide is very thick and works great
it really doesnt affect play at all so it doesnt matter
i agree with all the other reviews
these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too
durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack
comes with nice screw on 18 to 14 adaptor
these cans were decent back when they were just above 100 bucks
theyve inflated to 160 and thats just ridiculous
there is better in this price range
that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience
the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath
stay away dont fall victim to the noob hype
the athm50s are really solid studio headphones
i cant imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself
not for long seasons anyway
they are absolutely fantastic for the price
but i just need to stretch them out
i bought these to replace a pair of athm45s i had for 6 years
these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully
listening to music on them is a joy
i listen to music about 3  4 hours a day
they sound just like i thought they would
i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome
i would buy these again
i also own bose quiet comfort 15s and ae2s and the grado s80is
these have become my favorites
they have become my favorite phones
all in all quite a listening experience
i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones
they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones
finally and this is important theyre incredibly comfortable
they grip your head snugly without that horrible 34vice grip34 feeling
its one of the best purchases ive made in a long time
these headphones are kind of classics
very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites
they are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones
these do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior
i use these at work now
unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my sennheisers
they are a bit too small for my ears i guess
overall they are just not as good
they were a good price though and they fill a niche that i need
i have one of these and the amount of detail is great
i didnt know headphones could sound this good
garbage if you like it
this is not how the world of music sounds
too much bass and other garbage
are you guys really hearing anything
world has gone bass crazy since about 1981
bass only  take it or leave it
will go find real headphones thanks
im glad i tried something else
this one really fits my taste
the clarity is superb and the bass is awesome
first time ive spent over 25 bucks for headphones
use for both reference with a gnx4 and guitar and easy listening
very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect
semiaudiophilea bit bass heavy but overall great headphones
get hot to wear in the summer
i did my research on this buy
these are very clear and fine tuned
i am completely blown away with these headphones
simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually
make no mistake the athm50s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
i mix and master all my own music on these guys
before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen
thats because by themselves the athm50 dont have a flat frequency response
fortunately i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve
save this as a preset
i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the athm50
they translate better with the correction curve active
subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound
i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs
i wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well
replacement pads can be bought on amazon
so the padding material coating could have been better made
these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise
they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store
excellent sound quality and i would pin them against bose any day
these headphones are wonderful to wear
but thats not enough now a days
the pioneer hdj 2000 has the look
read my review on those though
both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head
not really a big concern though
they have a long cord and ill talk more about it later
it ends with a spin on 14 in or a standard 35mm
the sound out of these things is pristine
its not muddy and very clear
they have a good amount of bass
im using this in v1 in a 5 watt tube amp
i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube
i have a vox ac4tv
i had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom
that was a nice benefit
i didnt notice much of a change tonally
i think this tube basically brought the volume down
i ended up switching back to the 12ax7
he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain
he liked the result when i switched out the gt 12ax7
also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek 5881s for jj 6l6gcs
flash forward  this thing kills
it belongs in front of a tube amp period
this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone
for the price this is a fantastic buy
mxr make pretty good pedals for the money
i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion
it has plent of volume which is good for boosting
which is not a bad thing if thats what you are looking for
very midrangey sound as well
but its well built and would make a decent od
but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal
its a decent pedal very solid
its very light and thin sounding
this is another in the mxr distortion line
the tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable
in addition the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob
pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly
not much of noise and practical carry
if you really want to go for something a bit more 34marshall jcm900 like34
get a mxr custom badass 78 distortion
i dont hold it against the pedal though
in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have
im gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp
you should check out the 78 badasss distortion from mxr too
it has worked great now for over a year at least
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam
i didnt run it without this power source that seems too ghetto
but what do i know
what else can you say
thats a lot cheaper than spending twentysomething dollars on an additional wall wart
i got what i ordered
now my gear is always ready
he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses
it looks very stylish and functional as well
bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1
if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably
of course the durability is still in question at this point
i must say thanks to those reviewers
this is such a sturdy board
i must say though that i had no idea it would be so huge
this is a perfect addition to any serious rig
so far this board has performed superbly
this is a fantastic little recorder but not for 300
that was over 3 years ago
and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do
i use audacity to amplify when necessary to normalize always and to edit from
and if you goof and unplug it before powering it down no problem
from there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as
ive had this for several years
it has done a pretty good job with many recordings especially in the field
this little recorder is absolutely amazing for its size
takes some practice to appreciate all the features
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away
finally a product that is as simple to use as a pointandshoot camera
the file is saved and then you can push playpause to listen back
it is also handy portable and easy to take places
you can easily connect it to a computer windowsmac with the included usb cable
the only thing missing is a remote
also picks up noise from your movements
but for the price 199 its a real gem
this small device has amazing quality
the builtin mic records very well compared to those tiny handheld monorecorders
even nimh 12v batteries can power this although alkaline 15v last longer
con  the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully
after trying to use it i promptly returned it
recording from the internal mics seems to work fine
i finally ended up getting the tascam dr07 which i am very happy with
i also own an olympus ls10
this gives me the same recording ability 9624 but it is much less expensive
some have noted the zoom doesnt have speakers built in
you need monitors or quality headphones
i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments
as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material
olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls
this may be a big issue if you dont treat your equipment carefully
i am also looking at the zoom h1 which will come out in sept
this product may actually be the ls10 killer
the sound quality is amazing and its very easy to use
im using it for so many things including a music player for my truck
i take it everywhere and it has never let me down
samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website
unlike the edirol the h2 comes with a simple stand
i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness
also the edirol r09 is the darling of the moment
i dont use auto gain
if anything i try to err on the side of low
so it will force you to clean up your playing a bit
your h2 wont die during recording because the batteries give out
id give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial
but it might have if i had not broken its fall
and you will need a longer usb cord
i cant believe the one they sent was so short
and for the price id buy it again
im a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups
it is very easy to use
ive used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments
i often record one part of a duet then play along with it
there is little to fault with it
i finally got tired of messing with discs
i am very glad i got the h2
im raising my rating and the result
getting demoted from the front page
currently the h2 is my backup unit
but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder
anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed
the h2 unlike my pricey sony can handle both
getting the recorded signal onto a computers harddrive is expedited with the included usb
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
perhaps the primary dealmaker or breaker  the tiny screen and small controls
as for build quality my h2 is like new after almost 18 months use
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
very functional and easy to work with
small enough to take along
it is my most used gear in my life right now
i dont want anything else
if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely
there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall
it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the onoff switch does nothing
do you like to shift your booty around on the seat
its too narrow at 17 inches
i am going with a wider one
i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust
i ordered this bench for last christmas 2005
the seat is generously padded and is 25 inches thick
padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion
allsteel frame construction feels sturdy
each of the legs has 3 holes low middle high
three positions roughly correspond to 18 19 and 20 inches
see the picture and youll understand how it works
mine initially came with middle position
i also tried high and low but set it back to middle
sure its nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily
however with this price i wouldnt complain at all
this is perfect for our digital piano
i would recommend this to anyone
this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods
i was surprised at how comfy it was at the price
good height comfortable id buy it again no questions asked
to your weekly moving equipment caravan
some of us arent that luckyor giftedor smart
these are nicely made and the one i bought is working well
im very happy with it and will buy more as i need more
it is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well
looks like it is holding up so far
for the price these cant be beat
i buy this cable for my dj system and work great
not high quality but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks
ends are not too bad and it works for what it is
the cable is good and normal
good price and works well
but it works fine never had any problems with it
i think it would do fine in a live setting as well
these are descent quality cables
great price i own many of these
just a good basic cable
love the price and they shipped quickly
sold great quality xlr mic
its pretty hard to mess these up
i have finally learned my lesson
i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two
but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok
so by all means buy these on price but when you get your items
please fully check them out
this cable is great for xlr microphones or diboxes
they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality
these make great and affordable mic cables
not much else to say it works and looks well made
for the price this product is ideal
i find myself wishing i had ordered more
it is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly
i shall  probably get three or four more
actually much better than i expected for the price
would not hesitate to purchase this item
i like the flexibility of this microphone cable
an easy item to recommend for the price paid
i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones
here are their key points  good quality construction
bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable
now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want
i dont use it for any heavy use
i use it for podcasting purposes
so i cant speak to really heavy use of the product
seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason
fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky
i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot
thankfully it was just these cables
spend a little extra on another brand
its a mic cable haha
its a great cable for the price
it sounds good and seems to be very durable
i ordered this as a spare and at this time i havent used it
i gave it 4 stars on just expectation
just as good as any 20 xlr out there
considering i spent 600 for itit rules
will buy more when needed
this amp is something else
first i was fortunate enough to buy one for 300
as just simply an amp it has more power  as good of sound
the overdub layering is simply superb though its saved as mono
2  the chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough
line 6 please go to sdhc
i cant find a single complain about this amp
the amp modelling is fantastic
plug in for a miccdm3 player
only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds
but you cant ask for much more for the price of 399
you wont be disappointed with this amp
i bought my spyder jam back in 2009 when it was fairly new
i was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp
and with 24 minutes of looping time thats just crazy for the price
id say it started to cut into spyder jam sales
and the cybertwin is gone now
ive had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great
crank this baby up and it moves air
ive used all the ins and outs with no problems
i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line
by the way i have a gdec 30 for sale
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
i bought this amp for my 7 year old son
it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp
im a beginner and is more than enough for now
if im committed to learning ill get a better one later
this amp is small in size but full of sound
because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks
very responsive very clean sounding
this amp is well worth the price
i spent a lot of time on amazon reading reviews  comparing prices
i wanted an amp that would have overdrive and i also wanted some power
i am thrilled with the starcaster
my son loves them both
i bought this used off a friend when i got my first electric
the destortion works well enough
bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine
my only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough
i cant practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv
all in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point
i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around
little did i realize how good this one really is
most gig bags dont come with all these storage pockets
i really like the deluxe bags by fender
the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case
it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too
id recommend it to anyone
i bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there or across town
i just got this and love it
my fender stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag padded well too
i can fit all of my 34stuff34 into the many pockets as well
this is an excellent gig bag
plenty of compartments for all of your accessories
well padded and has enough carrying options
this fender is lots better then my other bag
i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg
the fenders straps are great
the straps on this fender stay put  love it
the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd28
but it can also my blueridge br180 or my seagull s6 coastal spruce
either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly
like i said its a great gig bag
if i ever need another ill be getting another fender gig bag
really am impressed with this gig bag
cant go wrong with this one
ive been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase
turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger
and im so glad i did
great padding yet still lightweight
and it arrived a day early
ibanez ew20 body not neck dimensions  w 16 d 5 l 20
thank you amazon  fender
look no further these are great bags
well padded lots of good pockets does all that it should
this arrived a week sooner then expected
unfortunately i think the roadrunner is better quality thicker material
i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent
another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor
its inexpensive and the padding is excellent
it looks like it will last too
i got this to use with my 12 string
it does the job however
for this price you will be satisfied
this strap fits the bill just fine
the shoulder strap tends to move while you play
gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist
i enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars
easy to install and remove
decent quality for the price
this guitar strap performs as expected for its price
i paid only 29 and it is small and convenient
i was impressed with the sound
at first i played it with my line 6 15 watt amp
i didnt like it cause of the squealing
but then i read how you use it and all that
i still like my line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain
but this is a bargain and small
you can use this with any usb audio interface
if you like acdc you would like this
there are different amp sounds you can get
cheap and convenient iam not disappointed
great bang for the buck clone of a tech 21 gt2
the tm300 is more than just a distortion box
its more like a preamp
i actually have the same criticism of my tech 21 triac really excellent pedal
this thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well
five stars for what it does at this price
if you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases
i was not disappointed at all
it gives you great sound for solos
stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal
i put it in my cart and continued shopping
the reviewers werent lying except that one guy who gave it a 2
it arrived today and i decided to give it a quick workout
it turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather
this thing just screams for solos and is very heavy for rhythm
i spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away
in fact i sold the delay and slow mo recently
this pedal however is going to get some serious use
im not crazy about the plastic casing but it seems sturdy enough
i cant recommend this pedal enough
behringers tm300 is made from tough plastic
the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones
i am playing out of a peavey but i hear a tweed
amazing clarity and worth the 28 and change
favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt thats flexible
i dont think that many people would do this
folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal
maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one
the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain
still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone
be forewarned  this pedal is gigantic in dimension
who cares so long as it sounds this good
this pedal gets me there on the cheap
thats part of the fun of tubebased od
at least try a new tube before giving up
this pedal got it 100 right with tone after a tube switch
compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss
bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything
this takes up at least the space of 2 pedals
its been the vintage tube monster every time
the master and gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel
the noise suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise
however when it comes to tubebased pedals big is par for the course
i honestly cant say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal
for 50 you literally cant go wrong
there are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly
i also found using a compresser before it helps
i have a pigtronix philosophers tone  it made a big differrence
not as a professional tube driver but quite well for the price
like many i cannot afford a tube amp
sustain and harmonics are insane
preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones
the unit is very heavy and rugged
i have a blue voodoo all tube amp
its a dinosaur but has a great tone
i thought this pedal would do the trick
behringer used to be known as junk but no more
purchased for my epiphone electric guitar
has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo
everything i would want in a gig bag
a quality bag for a quality instrument
what you see is what you get
fits either a tele or strat
the bag has removable backstraps for carrying ease
this is also a pretty handsome looking caseif thats what you care about
the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps
glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars
i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it
now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise
the korg cm100l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product
i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument
not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased
i used it a few times
it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic
i wouldnt buy another one
the cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines
the wire gets stressed at the mic clip andor plug and shorts out
i burn through one or two cm100l per semester
wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables
bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer
works well while other things are going on around you
i saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled korg
the one i got is labeled both on the package and on the clip
it could be thicker  it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up
still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender 34f34 logo
i was upgrading all the chrome on a mim and put this on
looks better than the plain one
they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool
it is a fender product so it is well made
it will make any strat or tele build shine
it was a direct replacement for the original
looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for
the plate was delivered on time and as promised by amazon
i just slapped one of these on my reliced 94 mim fender strat
actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great
had issues before with company but they resolved all issues
i would do business with them again
thanks for taking care of me
nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat
installed easy and the screws and everything were correct
not much to say about a chrome neckplate  its largely a cosmetic item
anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws
never really had to mess much with this item
its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it
mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine
but at this time i am not sure i like what i have done
it appears a little thinner than the original and just doesnt look as 34original34
a must have for the yamaha pa130
you can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries
good  power supply for the cheaper yamaha keyboards
i have never understood why yamaha keyboards dont come with a power supply
so i found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine
dont buy the one from the store this is cheaper
be patient and get this one
if you buy the keyboard youre going to need the power adaptor
but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip
it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in
btw i am using this not on the cp series
it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too
the yamaha keyboards that take batteries dont come with an ac power adapter
i am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases
this is a great pick
i am using the other 5 and they play very well
really cool looking and are nice picks for the
great deal from amazon   thanks
i will definitely buy more of these in the future
would like different holiday designs like this
these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness
nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery
my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job
the quality seems to be good and installation went fine
works with multiple straps as well
was easy for my husband to use
made me able to use a strap on my guitar
in fact its beautiful and totally functional
id buy it again but they should really include a washer
i used a rubber washer i had and that worked very well
it was easy to install
i hate minimum word review requirements
i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems
well made and easy to adjust
it may just have been the one i got though
not much to say about a guitar strap
so i decided to sign in and write this review
this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones
it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need
consider taking my advice  treat yourself
besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe
i use ctype snapon strap locks but they will no longer fit
maybe ill see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work
update  too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also
seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far
this is a perfect strap for my guitar
its not rough on my neck and is very adjustable
its very simple and is perfect for me
im very pleased with this purchase
classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black 76 tele custom
but he has good taste
this strap is strong and sturdy
even without strap locks im comfortable going crazy on stage
high quality does not fray stays on the guitar
does what you want and need and looks great
i like to walk around while i play
its a hangup of mine
this strap works fine for that
other than that its a good deal for the price
maybe i just need a shirt with more cling
i was expecting it to be a little stiffer but im glad it isnt
it fit my ibanez acoustic just fine
the fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing
the range of fit seems pretty good to me
i cant see it marring the guitar at all
it is comfortable around my neck and shoulder
made in canada seems well built and durable
other than that the strap is of good quality
this is the most ive ever spent on a guitar strap
but i have to say its well worth the price
very comfortable and looks great too
i dont play with a guitar below my waist
i am six feet tall
amazon should have clarified in their item description
thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review
im not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short
it just feels a little tight and crammed when i wear it
the leather itself isnt a bad quality but its not the finest
excellent strap for the money
the leather is thick and supple
a few basses i prefer higher
it was the perfect choice
all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort
i bought this because someone told me they really liked it
but its just not a good product
the leather feels a bit cheap as well
you get what you pay for
ill probably have to breakdown and pay 100 for a real strap
straps dont get any better than this
super leather very well puttogether
perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets
this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely
well made feels very strong
texture is very nice doesnt slip
overall a very good product
i am average build and play a strat
i shouldnt have to feel like this thing just barely fits me
i wish it had at least one more inch
this strap works fine on my fender strat
otherwise  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap
this is an excellent strap
that is a great strap and has held up wonderfully
i fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability
so why the new strap
i wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference
it isnt a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb les paul
a consideration  this is suede and will fuzz for the first little while
after these strap break in though they are very soft and supple
highly recommended for confort and durability
the whole strap is leatherno adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument
its simple and very secure
ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly
i would buy it again
on that level this strap succeeds
it also looks very nice
i have not encountered the dye running yet
honestly if i had it to do over i would skip this particular strap
suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment
this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed
this is my second black suede leather strap ive bought from levys
the 2534 is wide and comfy
i have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people
the strap is about 6 too short for my seagull s6 guitar
heres a link to the extendo optionlevys leathers mmgxl25brn strap extender http www
this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider
the terms bait and switch come to my mind
doesnt cut into your body at any point
this is a simple elegant strap that inspires envy
it could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps
not the least bit stiff like some leather products
my first experience with levy and completely satisfied
gorgeous strapped to my sons martin acoustic guitar
its pretty without distracting from the guitar itself
very well made and durable
ive even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water
the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time
this will last a very long time
it really nice made in canada not china wow
like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material
yes you can bend it
it will probably last 2 life times
ends are made of leather
this strap is really beautiful
id give this levys strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible
it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt
the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap
a straight up product well worth the money
you want it come get it
cant miss dealing like that
not much else to say about it
it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do
dont know why i waited so long
this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described
if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect
definitely top notch if this is what you are after though
first the goods  sturdy leather construction just cant be beat
the color is spot on with the pictures shown
im a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldnt have this problem
then theres the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadnt considered
its high quality but i didnt consider it trying to pull my shirt off
if had to do over again id pass
the feel of suede is hard to beat
this strap fits right feels good and looks handsome
i bought this strap for my luna 12 string
the strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what i needed
the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide
attaching it is a snap
looks great feels great and works great
finish stitching and adjustments are quality
but that means the guitar is very secure so i am very happy
great feel leather matches my instrument well
21234 width worked well for me compared to the 434 version
heavy construction in layered leather
there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking
i will buy another in a second color
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own
i own several acoustic  electric guitars
every strap is a levys
ive watched friends  bandmates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps
ordered this and two cables
plugged it in and it powered my rode nt2 condenser mic
for the price you cant go wrong
this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm
totally nofrills rock solid metal construction and you cant hear it at all
it supplies my microphones every time i run out
im glad i got this thing
i rate it five out of five stars
its like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends
soooo its pretty much useless to me
i think i payed like 8 for it so whatever
this daisy chain worked very well for me  no problems yet
it plugged into my behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely
its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week
a real money saver in the long run
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a 341 spot34 brand plug
it is not what i received
i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did
i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money
this cable expands the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v adapter
when i saw these things a light came on in my head
it was an 34uh duh34 moment
i had an old wallwart laying around and put it to good use
with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect
this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique standalone sound
this chorus is just about right
there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases
you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs
the chorus effect is a little weak
i use it now to get sort of a leslie effect
clean the effect is a little weak
the adjustment knobs dont seem to do much either
that said i lovebehringer products that i own
this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak
i tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail
all that said i still gota give the item its due
i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on
you may have to put something behind it or replace it
i have been playing guitar since i was 14 years old
i am now 57 so i have a few years of experience
first you guys who complain about the plastic housing
are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals
if you are stop doing it
all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works
the plastic housing is extremely strong and wont bust when used properly
get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain
it will save you a fortune
buy one learn how to use it and youll be happy
first behringer pedal i have returned
almost no effect provided by pedal
i have returned the unit
i am user that likes behringer products
i know is plastic but
what you should know about this pedal
the loop feature is quite good the delayecho entirely satisfactory
not as good as say a boss unit but they cost 5x as much
great for everything from slapback to long delay with heapbig repeats available
the plastic housing might not standup to the road
ive read some negative press about behringer pedals but personally cannot complain
i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal
the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically
made my tone thin and tinny
this is not true bypass but neither is the boss
i have not experienced the tonesuck or buzzing that others have complained about
is this the best digital delay on the market
surely not but its the best cheap one
believe me you figure it out at this price point
incidentally this pedal like any other digital delay or digital reverb will eat batteries
its what they do and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal
invest in a daisy chain spot or the like
thank u guys your pedals really kick butt
i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust
so i figured an experiment was in order
i let him kick that pedal on and off all night
i dont know much about delay and ive never really used it
this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay
kinda makes you aware of what you are playing
this behringer dd400 delay unit has a lot of great features
the extralong 1300 millisecond delay is great for pink floyddavid gilmour style solos
as long as i played loudly everything worked quite well
however when i set the guitar down for a moment i started hearing voices
the interference went away after a few minutes
as for design i dont buy the german innovation advertising line from behringer
if you want really good quality buy the boss unit
this thing is fun to play with
ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day
you can tweak the echo in 100s of different ways
thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob
i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not
no they do equal to my boss counterparts
especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isnt stock boss
they are made of plastic after all
i say why pay more
large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch
cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications
plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag
if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design
and that my friends is the problem
did i mention this sucker is big
i feel like they should name it the 34pedal porch34
maybe i can put a few potted plants on it
if the answer is 34hell yes i deserve them all
i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds
34 then by all means knock yourself out
this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there
for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok
ive owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards
first the pt2 and now the pro
pedaltrain makes a great pedal board
is all i can say
wow there is a lot of space on this thing
its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro
however if you need a lot of pedal space read the dimensions
did i mention this thing is freggin huge
minus one star for a little price gouging
dont buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca
well i hated each other one i tried
then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me
so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model
this is it right here
the silver one is excellent and its made of aluminum not thermoplastic
by now in contrast i would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones
not kidding dont use those in public situations
back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo
the great features are 1
ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos
this capo fits so easily
wow best ever in this category
ease of use is tops ever
it will never hurt you it only helps
i still cant believe how light it feels
it does what its supposed to that other capos dont do
my capos include bird of paridise paige and kyser
so i will probably be using it on my electrics
but like i said it good for the price
the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard
it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well
i just got it and tried it out
its not great but should work as a quiet practice amp
i would recommend this to anyone
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do
generously ill give it 2stars
something like this really should last at least a year or more
sound is not so good
im a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play
solution  hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive
this was a good choice
but i had serious questions about the classic rock amplug
would it be only a one trick pony
but thats where the similarities end
more importantly the sound doesnt deteriorate with higher volumes
highly recommend the classic rock  5 stars
i prefer woven cables for looks
they have a nice stage presence
hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables
nice cable could be a little heavier
i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input
looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought 2
i really like this cable
i particularly like the right angle plug
it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars
this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables
im very pleased with it and recommend it
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product
ive used hosa for years they have never let me down
all their cords are quit and are quality produces
i have never had a hosa go bad on me
looks really cool and sounds great
i like them a lot
everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem
this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion
its worth spending a jackson imo
the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package
save your money and buy a better cable
i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else
the sound quality is amazing
hands down the best cable i have ever owned
definitely will buy mogami from now on
compared to my old cable the mogami gold produced a more transparent sound
you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea
no matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound
what is there to say
i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami
sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables
but you will not hear a difference
lifetime warranty and you wont be replacing it any time soon
works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio
all i own are mogami cables
check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord
but it works fine for me
bought several of these and they worked fine
this cable is built to last
overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly
these hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended
no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing
good buy for the price
these are great patch cables
they make a strong connection between pedals and dont sacrifice any sound quality
its well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market
ii do replace it for guitar cable work fine im happy with this unit
recommend to someone need replace cable jct
i have no complains about it at this time
works great with my on stage keyboard stand
if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone
it now rest at bottom of a box
great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered
fits a standard xstand just fine and makes a very secure connection
you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube
the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 75
im mounting it to a heavy duty on stage brand double x stand
the mic end of the mount works pretty good
i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine
i am running a dj karaoke system
item received looks diferent i say better
our second week and all is well
using speakon cables mono to each speaker to speaker for easy mixing
xlr to xlr from mackie mixer to pylepro 1400 watt amp
think i will get another one for the stage monitors
might as well go allin
this amp did a good job for its rating
it was my backup amp for a qsc gx5
i sold it after using it for about a year or so
it might even be over 34engineered34 it fits so well
this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is 34 size
i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me
i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the gs specs
what is it they say in this era  caveat emptor
i am finally feedback free
i use this on my 310 taylor with a kk pure pickup system
this blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole
i dont get a huge loss of tone but a little bit
this cover does not fit a full size acousticelectric hohner guitar
it measures 4 1634 in diameter so check your guitar closely
eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned
it needs some force to put it into place
but on my washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there
it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt
it fits tight but its fine
great at eliminating feedback in a live setting
also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly
i am impressed how well this works
i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs
its important to you to know the diameter of your guitars soundhole
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback
doesnt reduce sound worth a darn
i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things
muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in db
this is a good product which ive seen many people use
however its not for all acoustic guitars
didnt look tapered to me and i cant use it
check your guitars sound hole diameter before ordering
fits perfectly in sound hole
no more feedback or waking up the next room
play an ibanez acoustic electric
works well easy to install and take out
helps greatly to control acoustic feedback
i would say it muffles too much though
it does the job though
im very happy with this pedal
the click effects wear out sooner
youll know its on by the tone change and the bright led light
imho you dont need a click switch
quality and value all the way
it sounds like its behringer
very fake cheap sounding phaser but its all i need
germany company manufacturing is in china
i really dislike the switch on this thing
this does not turn off when i do that
this is unlike any pedal i have played
anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane
wish the phase came in a different case
it filled a hole that was missing
i give them an excellent rating
get them if you like gilmour
this custom gauge set plays great
they tuned right up with very little stretching
i will buy these again
the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set
i may try those next time on my les paul
and on the mims fenders either cause both of mine are american standards
all in all im very pleased with the dg ghss
i use these on my fender strat and they sound great
sound great play great feel great tune great
i am now dedicated to these strings
once it does its beautiful music after that
ive not yet had a broken string with them
good strings help create good sound
these are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well
ive bought these daddario strings a few times because they are a great deal
they sound nice and bright and they last a good while
they are easy on the fingers
the best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3pack
put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier
and look like i make very good choice
these strings arent anything fancy but they sound great
a good old standard that ive used since i was a kid
and this is the best price ive found
these strings are as advertised
nice tone and good quality
actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar
solidly built works just as a mic stand should
works well for my needs
it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well
i would recommend it for light to moderate use
i just used this for a gig on monday
im not unhappy though this stand works quite well
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you
i will get another for my monitor
i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy
i would think it would work even better with a mic
its light weight and sturdy
both models cost about the same with the pm05 roughly 20 cheaper
while the bx5a has a bigger tweeter separate xlr  trs jacks
the pm05 has more boom but less treble
for my homestudio purpose i like the warmer sound of the pm05 more
these speakers worked great for 14 months
last week 4813 one of them wouldnt power up all the way
i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake
i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week
one on the east coast and one on be west coast
maudio doesnt stand behind their products and ill never purchase anything from them again
ive used these on the reg for a year
id recommend these to someone trying to save some money
updatetwo years in with continued regular use
they sound just as good as they did a year ago
my old pair of jbl studio pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost
i do mixing and voice overs so i needed the real deal
after extensive research and listening i decided on the maudio bx5a deluxe
for the price they can not be beat
punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range
they are also very accurate i hear things just the way they are recorded
great speakers for portables like an ipod
i have a 75watt amp that powers a 12 celestion speaker
these monitors have 70watts powering a 5 woofer and a 1 tweeter 40w30w respectively
the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless
if you really need some get some more substantial pads
the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours
not really concerned about that but its worth mentioning
they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout
they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon
i would really recommend not going to a retailer
even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online
on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing
i mean they are not computer speakers or anything
the sound is very forward i would say harsh
thats not uncommon among studio monitors
there is definitely a lot of clarity here
theres a few schools of thought on studio monitors
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first
any flaws would be quite noticeable
i previously used krk rp8s so i can compare these to them
granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors
i liked them better than these
they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass
i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in
see if i could improve the situation
the buzz increases in volume over time
so i sent them back
maybe behringer 3031as or something
sound nice but very unreliable bx5a deluxe
i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model and after only one week
one of the internal amps will no longer power up
maudio was a much better company before avid took them over
definitely provided extra gripping surface
the pick extends out from the rubber shell
obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer
so i do carry and use these occasionally but they arent my everyday pick
ive only been using the yellow one so far only just started using them
the colors and designs are pretty
as far as i can tell they are all the same widththickness
for some reason i thought theyd have different thicknesses from a previous review
and so far i havent lost any yay
wish i discovered these years ago
comfortable and the grip works wonders
nice clear tones with this pick tips
especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time
whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out
picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology
these pick are cutting edge
possibility created by the multiflex feature and the grip
these make me a better player
i used to have trouble holding on to picks
these dava picks are very nice
they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick
the rubber grip area is great
the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time
the effect is subtle at best
overall i like these picks a lot
the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand
ill try the dava picks again later if i feel the need
undoubtedly better for more accomplished players
most advice ive seen says try em all and decide for yourself
i love these  picks  im  defintley getting some more
these stay connected but arent so wide that they change the style of picking
i like them and so does my music teacher
we try to stay stocked in these picks
so far i really like these
the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a lightmedium
the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool
i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out
i doubt i will lose them
they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick
i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just cant compete
this was a huge disappointment
probably good for strumming but not good for lead
i have always had trouble holding onto picks
my fingers just couldnt do it for extended play
nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body
i wish i would have thought of these
they were just what i needed
i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere
i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great
ive found a new favorite pick
i keep ordering more of these picks
i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar
these picks are kind of thin flexible and have a good rubber grip
theyre as good for speedpicking as they are for strumming
the only complaint i have is that theyre too thin for me
the pack brings 6 picks
they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings
dava 6024 grip tipitem is as advertised
they work just fine for a starter
have been for the last 30 years
i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip
every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers
loose grip little sweat slick finish
you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick
incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it
and i can even hold onto it
very nice grip on these
just hit add to cart
that being said i have to admit that these picks are very high quality
the design is really pragmatic and effective
we just need to be open to it
and thats a good thing
i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition
my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a nobrainer
my experience with this little tuner has been perfect
it is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions
you do need to hit only one string at a time however
size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable
ps i use it for my base though satisfied
onebutton operation makes it simple to operate
the best tuner for your board in my opinion
silent onoff and i have two of them
recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig
i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree
i use to tune with an antique korg
i saw these baby on the road with maroon5s james
just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect
this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as im concerned
its virtues are many and varied
the output is muted while the tuner is engaged
plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch
this is my third purchase of this tuner
very easy to tune my basses
one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass
the other are for me one as a backup
i may have to tape it down to keep it in place
the other two tuners dont have this issue
still its the best around
for me this is the best guitar tuner
and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner
you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner
it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board
i would buy it again
no other choice on the market imho
this is the one to get
i have two and would buy again if i needed another one
the display is bright and clear
its rugged well thought out solidly built and simple
its explained in the manual but could be clearer
id buy this again without hesitation though
this product is easy to use without any noise at all
i truly recommend it as a tuner pedal
im happy with this product
king of the practical tuner world
price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on
imo you cant go wrong with this tuner very pleased
im telling you get it
my only complaint is that it could be smaller
the primary draw here is the bright lightup display with wide color bars
the tuner works quickly and reliably
the build quality is outstanding and its true bypass
this is a great tuner at a reasonable price
awesome tuner really fast and responsive
nice and bright so i can clearly see it on stage in the dark
occasionally i get a small pop when i engage it but not that frequently
just picked up the korg pitchblack from guitar center yesterday
love the thing so far
i like the multiple display options and calibrations
mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe
great buy i am happy with it
i got it in red
easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators
this tuner did just fine with the low b on a 5 string bass
some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency
very good tunner with bypass switch
i think its a good choise for any pedalboards
i changed this for a tc electronic polytune
get one and have fun
because its not programmable im getting another
im on my second us600 pedal after the first one broke
i applied a lot of force to pull the cord out
behringer us600 ultra harmonistshifter pedal is pretty good
you need a little time to learn then it will rock you
you get what you pay for
i am thinking of selling my bass
it has just become a needless expense
havent got to far into this thing yet but i do like it
same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with
it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for
i havent seen much more expensive ones with these features
a great buy for the money
the behringer us600 is wellmade
i purchased the us600 specifically for the 34detune34 effect
this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps
i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects
this makes the guitar sound huge
the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses
it wont make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony
however it is handy for short solos
i tried it in the key of g and got useful results
the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal
the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound
overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals
it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor
in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect
im glad i finally decided to get it
the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price
the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus
the other effects are icing on the cake
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal
i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature
also the pedal just started oscillating a few times
the behring us600 is a basic pitch shifter dont expect elaborate effects
made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal
goes through 9v batteries quickly so stock up
if you use an ac adapter get a hum eliminator
also run the us600 after the distortion for optimum performance
other wise you are shifting the clean signal
distortion pitch shifter chorus then out
the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there
dont expect a 2 octave bottom because it doesnt do that
for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesnt advertise
lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos
super cool pedal with tons of applications
it sounds great for recording
i wouldnt take it on a tour or anything it is plastic
the harmonizing function can be buggy at times
the trem function works great
one of my favorite pedals of all time
its a mainstay on my pedal board now
it works just fine and im happy with it
its exactly what you would expect from behringer it works
this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up
and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use
big win for the guitar though
but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with
i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed
someone will appreciate it but not me
cheap so no big loss
an old school delay that works very well
adjustments for intensity and length
uses 9v batt or power adaptor
easy to use very low price classic sounds
i wish i had 4 ears so i could buy another one
i also have a danelectro  fab echo and this just blows it away
some of them have good quality both in make and sound
hopefully behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price
some have complained that its construction is not the best
i actually had to send the first one back because it did not work
but some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle
it can do a lot more but its what i wanted
sturdy enough well priced and simple to use
perfect pedal it sounds great no matter what your levels are
not noisy at all so fits in with other pedals on your board great
for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase
i feel it sounds really good and has many settings
i think the build on these are fine for daily use
dont expect it to break anytime soon anyway
i replaced my delay foot pedal with the behringer vd400 analog delay
it is doing exactly what i expected and much more
the big name delay i replaced  in all honesty  wasnt as good
i have more room and control with this pedal
they are both great pedals that i use all the time
mxr is by far better then boss imho and i do love my dd3
also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays
this is hands down the best delay pedal i have ever used
the delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound
if youre looking for a creamy true bypass analog pedal then look no further
the carbon copy is the best there is
this is super warm and can get very trippy
i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal
again do your youtube homework and listen around and youll come to your conclusion
amazon is great to deal with
i have a lot of pedals
including many delays and echos
i like the choruslike mod button
very lush and sweet to listen too
simple to use compact and well built
i like using this clean
but even its ability to take some distortion is pretty good
lush is the right word
then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby
this is exactly what i wanted
it fills out the sound and yet doesnt add any artificial high end
sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement
i dont regret my decision this pedal sounds great
the repeats are long and do not sound artificial
if youre looking to recreate the edge sound analog delay is not for you
one minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least outofthebox
i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself
this is a great effect
i am very happy with it
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there
this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver
i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations
this company dunlop gets it right with the mxr line
i dont hate boss and use their superoverdrive in my chain
its so much warmer than the boss
side by side the mxr won hands down
well at least for me
it goes from slapback to space shot very easily
its a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use
im really happy with this and would replace it god forbid
this pedal really hits the spot
im very pleased with it
i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites
this is one of the top delay pedals the pros use
you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal
from aint talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the 80s
i like that feature alot
this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range
its warm and the modulation sounds great
get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun
its the tube screamer of delay pedals
low settings not too echoey more like a bassd out reverb
hey  stop reading this and order it
the range of this delay fortunately is quite wide
i believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds
rhythmic u2 delays are usually around 350450 ms
this makes it very convenient but also a bit touchy
i also like the tone a lot
theres a great video on yt from proguitarshopcom that demos it very well
i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain
i hope this helps your decision
if you like warm old school tones youll dig this pedal
all i can say is wow
the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very wellmade
this unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay
its not so 34digital and bright34 delay like boss dd3 or dd7
mod switch adds a perfect 34chorus34 effect for 80s metal ballads sound
there are a couple of annoying inconveniences
one is the bright blue light indicating 34on34
this has been commented on before
i did find a solution
i put dark nail polish over the led bulb
this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting
every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps
some people pick on behreinger because theyre stuff is still cheap
this one is a keeper
works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options
i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb
i bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp
there are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds
nice addition for the price
uses a 9v battery or power supply
some things are great values others are cheap
the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change
the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic
if you get stuck using batteries plan on 34 hours worth of use
its also a noisy pedal
like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined
the 63 spring is great the plate is also really good
it also has a worththepricealone space feature
also known as shimmer a synth playing behind your instrument
paired with a chorus effect you can get some really cool tones
if you gig or record and need a reverb
you arent even looking at this pedal
dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument
bought verbzilla digitech rv7 and the verbzillas ripoff   behringer rv600
so for that many kind of modes barely useful
then i tried the digitech rv7
wow what a construction its got there
and the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it
theres no heavy reverb there
i couldnt get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal
but i love the gated reverb feature among all modes
every other modes are just nothing special really
it was just a light reverb i get
aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal
let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that ive tried
they are all battery hogs
so i suggest you to use the power adapter
its all comes back to our ability to make good music
ive been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970s
i said all that bc i dont want to come off as condescending
check the polarity of the tip  is the tip positive or negative
make sure the voltage matches
a 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal wont power it
i fried a bbe delay the same way
all in all it was worth the money
comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it
a lot of options available with this goodsounding pedal
great unit for the price
it offer a lot of variations in echo delay types
it is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece
even so would nothesitate to use that way
i cant say what battery life is as only use withan ac adapter
the em600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps
when youre satisfied just hold again to enter regular onoff mode
thats a win for the customer because it decreases the price
so why only 4 stars
so the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker
but my aggravations are really small ones
but it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects
ive had this for 4 days and im so glad i bought it
it has so many functions
unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic
i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it
all in all a good value for the money
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it
there are gig bags and there are gig bags
ive ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags
this one offers almost no protection
it did fit my kala katg with room to spare
this is my second makala gig bag
single layer of fabric providing no protection
why do i like this bag better
its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside
as good as a hard case
but very good for a bag
i also like the fact that theres no logo on the outside
i can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke i want inside
that was a disappointment for another reviewer for me its a plus
the dorky pad around the handle
and it just looks better without it
the construction fabric color and padding are all a1
this is a super bag
my precious uku will always be protected and look good too
i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag
anyway it doesnt seem much more then a normal gig bag
yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not
not sure how well it holds a tenor since i dont have one
mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
it cannot be denied that the boss dd7 is a versatile effective product
i havent used expensive rack units etc
but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses
battery runs out fast so get an ac adaptor
this one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features
the analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal
this thing can do anything
it feels like the iphone of delay pedals to me so far
like it can do all this crazy cool stuff
but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too
wait you can call people with an iphone
its the latest boss delay pedal
what else is there to say
since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the dd3
sorry if im rambling but seriously im in love with this pedal
i have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades
i like this one the best
especially for the price range
boss dd7 beats the pants off the line 6 echo park delay
you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp
the boss dd7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone
many great features including an onthefly samplerlooper
the ability to control it with an external pedalswitch
easy to set and adjust while playing live and onthefly
matches perfectly with other boss pedals
standard built like a tank boss construction is renowned for
it also beats the other boss delay pedals available for quality sound and features
many options settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile
i bought this for quality ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live
it also selfoscillates  freaks out quite well
if youre into that sort of thing
make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual
tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay
como solo boss lo sabe hacer
this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player
this means their stuff is made to last
this is the best delay i have tried thus far
extremely versatile and as is typical with all boss pedals absolutely sturdy
item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging
needed this cable to hook up my dean evo to a practice amp
these cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the usa
this makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price
these cables are wellbalanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass
they are wellshielded look nice and handle well
this is a cheaply built cable
the amp is on my belt
i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below
like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele
let me say three feet is short very short
glad i have it only for the purpose i intended
wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables
i bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an allinone guitaramplifieretc
kit that finally went bad
seriously for the price these cant be beat
id even pay a lot more for them
dont let the offbrand name put you off
go ahead and get them  youll be glad you did
so i tried this cable and it works perfectly
very heavy cord and top quality construction
cant beat the price either
works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room
holds it in place and are of high quality material
i recommend it a lot
unhappy with it actually i already replaced them
this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut
otherwise these are a good value with easy on  off
ive read the revues and some dont do them justice
it does everything its supposed to do
i got these for about 12 here on amazon
issues not only continued but worsened
hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes
i eventually put back the original el84s and that didnt help
my experience with the tungsol tubes was very very negative
they caused me to go out and buy another amp
i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast
ill never buy this brand again
easy to do and youll notice an immediate increase in distortion
placed one in a fender blues junior
tung sol knows how to do it
i recently acquired a vox valvetronix ad100vt combo amp from my local music shop
when i tried it at the shop it sounded great
small improvement but not close enough
after couple of weeks i also noticed some volume variations as i played
this one came up in the specs of doing just that
i believe it was x
treat these like halogen bulbs
groove tubes were the tubes to have in the late 80s
now a days i read they are rebranded chinese tubes
speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice
type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome
i found the tongsol to give me the best tone over all
less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp
i really like the way the tungsol makes my jazzmaster sound
it gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs
theyre not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones
i have little experience with tube voodoo
so all i can say is that it is working well for me
not sure how to rate this tube
maybe it is built better
but thats yet to be seen
so i sent it back
i ordered a ts 6v6 and am still waiting for it
maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes
well made tube with good amount of gain and highs
excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity
for high gain metal however i found that its a bit too hairy
adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect
for the price and quality i would buy two other ones
excellent value and you know what
it is identical in every way with the retail store product
same made in china product with another no name logo stuck to it
perfect for the garage band
always good to have a stationary mic on the floor
went together perfectly and i really wanted it
shipping was fast and no problems
the base for this thing is a monster
great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments
it does not come with a mic clip so youll need to get one
its a great deal buy it
great mic stand for the price
this is just like any other microphone stand
it works the same and is pretty durable
other than that its great
this mic stand is a great value
this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed
i bought a few years back and its still working amazing till this day
if youre purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands
mic stands can be a hassle sometimes
this is not one of those
built to last and great price as well
bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design
works great and base is out of your way
much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use
it is well made and i would buy it again if needed
the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver
great stand for the price
threaded fine and its heavy enough for any mic youve got
there are better out there but its a good value
it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up
its durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
they look good and the paint lasts great for a performance space
not a issue with manufacturer but dont drop it too hard
despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use it
overall this is a pretty good stand
it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights
im just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider
i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions 1
it looks really good sturdy and well made
i pushed the stand and
you can set the height always considering that your guitars dont reach the floor
they dont touch the floor
it takes up very little space the biggest plus
stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully
constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment
it is barely workable for two
so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand
this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for
i started searching around and found this product
the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen
the musicians gear stand does everything i needed it to
it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble
i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less
its supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasnt tilted back or fallen over
im glad i bought it and would buy from the company again
its sturdy well made and cheap
expect less for that price
excellent fine manufacturing good finish
perfect for my line 6 75 wt
it works well at all heights
would buy again if given the circumstance
if was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood
i have 2 70w 1234 amps and a big fender dsp 212
i am using this for my 112 amps
i recommend them to do the job for the
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
easy to assemble and feels very solid
way cheaper than i saw in guitar center
im very pleased with this stand
i use this stand for a smaller 50 watt fender amp
i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand
it is essentially three parts  the base and two removable arms
one final note  these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage
overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavyduty
at the current price at the time of this review its a bargain
for 20 this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation
helped a lot with vibrations in my apartment building
would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but
what more do i need to say
i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button
is sturdy and good for price
really satisfied with the chair
i cannot explain how cool this chair is
the back rest support is nice too
i use the chair for guitar bass keyboardsukulele and even cooking breakfast
lightweight slightly awkward but provides good back support
i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck
i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions
but its a nice design and thank you to the designer
i would recommend it to those who can afford it
i have had it for three months now and it is still fine
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
easy to assemble and feels solid
firstly let me address the 34adjustable backrest34
theres nothing adjustable about the backrest
the backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this
then youre left with several pieces to schlep
not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day
overall though i am very happy with the way this stool feels
no more couch and kitchen chairs for me
i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle
assembling is simple and fast
another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists
i used this with drums
the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport
its not a deal breaker
looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand
went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive
went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand
i will probably buy a couple more of these
this stand is made of quality products
it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right
this is our second one as we both have guitars
came very well packaged and with all the pieces
i was very easy to assembly and looks great
for the price you really cant go wrong with this guitar stand
works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar
the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar wont fall off
padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected
great stand for the price
i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical
relatively small but is a secure
the locking top is a good feature as well
id recommend this over the larger tubular type
no modifications needed not even bending
that last 14 63mm of movement on each leg was worth 100 improvement
anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all
i purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter
it is not overly strong or stable but the prices was right
this seems to be a nice rugged stand
much better than the one i received with a guitar i ordered
it went together fast and is well padded
it cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid
but im having fun and trying
this is a very wellbuilt stand
great stand durable folds down nicely and really does the job
i keep one at home and just ordered another one for school
not a whole lot to say about it
i needed a stand at home and this does just fine
i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy
the stand arrived very quickly
the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar
it helps him remember to practice when he sees it
works like its supposed to
no complaints at all for the price
i will be buying more in the future
i used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier
now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer
it really makes the guitar stand out
it was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it
works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time
worthless and its now holding my sons 34 size classical guitar barely
undaunted i ordered this musicians gear stand
for 8 you cant beat it
it is a guitar stand
does what it is built to do
good buy for the cost
my guitar just love it
this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be
it is all i want or need from a stand
i have bought three of these
i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand
the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it
they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice
it works well i mean it doesnt crumble apart or anything
thats why i dont use them anymore
this stand is very sturdy well made  durable
foam padded everywhere guitar touches
can be folded for easy transport
rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard
pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand
highly recommended very happy with purchase
works great as a stand for the elec
and i like it for starting out learning
this is a very well made guitar stand
it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time
for the price this stand just cant be bet
this guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble
works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand
i thought they would be the same but they were not
this stand is built much better
the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe
this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap
i actually own an even dozen of these
ive never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars
they work great  you cant beat the price
i think i paid around 495 for most of the ones i purchased
it is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price
update  january 7 2013
the price is right and they keep them safely stored
this is a great product
very light very sturdy and at a low price
it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable
i am very pleased with the quality of this stand
it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less
it shipped on time and the packing was good
this stand really is pretty tough
i purchased four and they were all delivered on time
each adjusted to and held its guitar securely
i have found the stand to be very stable
the welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job
my music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much
its does not appear to be of better quality
ive used this stand for about two years now and it held up great
seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it
it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks
a good moderately priced guitar stand
a good moderately priced guitar stand
i would recommend purchasing it
very pleased with this purchase
i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it
a day doesnt go by where the stand is not in use
just finished setting it up
stout stable and even looks good
its holding a gibson les paul so it has to be trustworthy
when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly
this cradles my guitar nicely
it actually reclines back fairly far
well father than it looks like it would in the pics
one of the best stands in the industry
fits any guitar banjo or even a cello
good construction and easy to put together
how can you beat that
i got 2 of these for my electric guitars
they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent
do be careful when unfolding as pinching of skin would be very easy
the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy
the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well
i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include
all in all these arent bad
not quite perfect but a good value for the money
good little stand to hold your guitars
they function well and are inexpensive
do not use these or any other foam for that matter on nitro finishes
good product at a great price
does its job just fine
its cheap light simple and does its job
not sure what else you could want out of it
im more than happy with it but just dont know what else to add
bought two of them about a year ago and im still happy with them
i like that this is fairly light
it works as expected and has not given me any problems
the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong
overall a reasonable value and im glad i bought it
it is what it is
works as expected and should last a really really long time
i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal
these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable
these are not 85x11 paper size
they are about halfsheet size
ive had this for 4 days and so far its still working perfectly
right product at the right price
nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesnt work
thats not the case here
this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied
but why go to all that trouble
this product lives up to its calling
by todays standards thats as good as it gets
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work
works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power
i trust the planet waves brand
i plugged it in the outlet
plugged it into my fender mini tonemaster amp
i dont need to worry about batteries any more
i bought this using prime and am happy with the power supply
i have many different makes of power supplies
in the end they are all the same
proof of this lies in the boss unit i have owned for 20 years
i got this for my line6 pocket pod
it works great so far
and was way cheaper then the line6 adapter
i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers
thus far i am very pleased
i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either
it does its job reliably and well
i would definitely recommend it to a friend
works well with every pedal i tried so far
cant ask much more than that from it
it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon
this was recommended and i am happy with the product
someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than i did
the first one worked great and so does this one
i would recommend this product to everybody
this has an output of 300 milliamps
for electronics the voltage has to be correct
but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs
but its a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter
ok reviewing somethings i just dont see the need
i dont know what else to say
it is not variable speed
onoff in either direction with full torque
but variable speed would have been nice
it is a little loud
does what it should as expected
the head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config
the trigger is a rocker switch
so you can wind and unwind
thats a good thing for the most part
it is not variable speed
it takes some practice and patience
nothing special just the will to get used to it
a few minutes of rehearsal with it and youll get to like it
i would have much preferred a device that has a twoposition switch
slow and fast position on the trigger for more control
it does all that the advertisements say it will
all in all be patient and all will be well
ive got hours if i chose to
i suspect most folks are in the same position
if youre a roadie for a big group i could see the need
im so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool
i frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously its a huge convenience
even if it doesnt save a whole lot of time its very ergonomic
wish it had more speed variance but its great for the price
looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered
if you have one or many expensive guitars buy these
they keep you guitar safe from falling
very very easy to install and protects
i had the ones that came with my strat which i believe are schallers
these have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern
that would make it easier to grab and use
these will now be my default locks
the quality of the nickel is very good too
earnie balls guitar strap locks are great
you can definetely trust them to do their job
my les paul is heavy
the strap would constantly fall off
so i decided to get a set of strap locks
you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap
when i buy a new guitar i get new locks
are there better locks out there
has never failed me yet
the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure
but these do work really well
but this is true for most strap lock systems
so i say go for it
then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation
i installed them last night and could not be happier
this is a great product at a good price
it is too long and will likely split your neck
i got this duet2 instead of the singlelight version as most kindle users do
its a versatile light source and i really like it a lot
each light has multiple independent settings
the beams are narrow but you get two of them
this light is exactly what i needed
i love the dual bulb design
the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand
overall i like the design and flexibility
accidental turnon in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem
i bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great
the plugin accessory is great and my pedal board has an outlet
it runs fine on batteries also
these are great  have 3 of them now
i use them when i play with my duet and sometimes with the band
will but another one if any of them die great product
not as bright as i would like them however very nice
i can practice without lighting up the whole house
im glad that i bought it
super excellent for dimly lighted rooms
thanks for good quality products at a fair price
the ac adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness
this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely
the light from the leds has a blue tint to it
id prefer something more white
each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting
this mighty bright is  great
this music light has one drawback it doesnt have a master switch
i use this light for music sheets documents and books
it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books
the small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling
it runs on electric so no need for batteries
it will clip on anything you want to hold it
its simple well made and works great
i use this microphone mainly to record music
for instance the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright
i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment
check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing
i am very glad i made this purchase
ive owned this mic for 2 years if youre curious about durability
this was a low price and high quality solution
nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box
this mic is absolutely awesome
it looks and feels so high quality
best mic in this price range by far
this microphones quality is amazing
nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great
i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac
the simplicity of this mic is very nice
the sound quality is also very decent
the only complaint i have is that there is no onoff switch
the only way to turn it off is to unplug it
other than that i totally recommend this microphone
this is the best usb condenser mic ive ever used
i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr
i only use this microphone for podcasting
i do not record music with it but i havent tried yet
the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand
its made me check out other audiotechnica products
i bought this microphone for youtubepodcasting and it does a really perfect job
the quality is great for me
it was what i had expected it to be
these should last a lifetime barring any physical damage
made in the usa to boot
these may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny
perfect chain for most rock sounds
get the 28 strand for a thicker snap
i might try out the 28strand next year
im pretty happy with this one right now
the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains
great product at a excellent price
it proudly states the guitars origin of corona
california with the classic fender name scribed
i have these on all three of my fenders
again these should really come standard on all american strats
used this to dress up the saga tele kit i bought on amazon
it fit perfect and gives the fender name to a saga kit guitar
dont think ill fool anyone but what the heck
it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back
i took a chance and got this one and it was a good call
this one is very thick and solid like its supposed to be
i used the screws and it was an easy install
other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate
the plate has five screw holes but doesnt look bad using 4
i tried another miniamps but all sounds like toys
this is totally different its the real thing
made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound
i had this misconception that my hands 34just werent designed to play guitar34
but recently my life changed a little bit
my sons mom thought it was a toy 34its so small
34 yes you might think so until you plug it in
the idea here is to sound loud without being loud
this amp is perfect for that
i use this as my 34clean34 sound without the overdrive
no this is not the same as actually being loud
for one thing your ears wont ring
the cops wont come knocking to serve a noise complaint
knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves
so i play while im watching football or baseball
i play while im watching the news
i play while im playing crazy 8s with my son
i play morning noon and night
not only that but im actually getting to be notthatbad at playing either
this orange micro crush amp lives up to its name
surprisingly loud really its amazing that much sound comes out of that thing
then a volume knob a tone knob and thats it
i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock
i was surprised at the sound that this amp produces
the build quality is top notch
tuner is right on overdrive seems fine
im not an overdrive player
cons  so far none and i dont expect any
im very satisfied with the performance of the cm2
a toggle switch lets you choose between classic  modified setting
the level knob has a lot of juice
if you set it at 10 or 11 oclock its plenty loud enough
you can also stack the cm2 with other pedals
the ds1 usually hurts my ears but with the cm2 behind it sweet
its well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to
try it you cant go wrong
think about it if you dont get it
second i dont like having a lot of pedals
the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to 7
but of course then its too loud
based on those criteria the digitech cm2 is perfect
it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point
it does not sound like an amplified pedal
i use the cm2 if i want to play dirtier and for covers
two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want
the cm2 sounds great in both applications
over the clean channel of the fender it sounds very full and smooth
boutiqueesque is how i would characterize it
however i use it more as a frontend boost to my alreadyoverdriven bugera amp
as a conclusion im really pleased with the quality of the digitech cm2
this is the one pedal i cant do without
sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion
so you cant use this as a clean boost pedal
with high output humbuckers you still get some mild tubelike overdrive at zero gain
but this isnt advertised as a clean boost pedal
plenty for classic rock and blues
but its not a distortion pedal its just an overdrive
this thing uses tiny smc components in the circuitry and therefore isnt really moddable
unlike the bad monkey this doesnt have an additional mixer  cabinet emulated output
the classicmodified switch is pretty cool
this keeps me from adjusting my amp each time i switch guitars
classic is a slightly lower gain more midboosted sound
think peavey 6505 eq structure
modified is more scooped saturated
so this switch is a useful little bonus
you get what its advertised to do
like others though i cant stop playing through this
great purchase especially if bought used
4 the case is made of metal
this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitechs tl2
instead it produces a warm oldtime overdriven tone
this cup bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water
or adult bottled beverage while playing
this is an absolute musthave item for any gigging drummer
holds your drink just like it says it will
what more can you ask for out of a drink holder
my musician friends notice and wish they had one
the cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups
i imagine it would hold beer too
now its right where i can find it everytime
this cup holder does the trick
it also holds my water bottle with no problem
the problem is it doesnt do both at the same time
thats on me this is a good product for what it does
most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned
but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka
moment from time to time  more falls into place
thats what you do at home and its called practice for a reason
i dont really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described
this is a very useful and quite educational musicians piece
i love this little device
im an amateur musician so im on and off on playing
for example im playing with the harmonica now
one section of this wheel lists all of these different scales
although i play guitar i find the other side of the wheel less helpful
tons of useful information on this wheel
seems like reasonably durable construction
compact enough to stow it in a guitar case
this is a great complement to study theory
a good tool for study and applying to your music
keep on hand to help understand theory
also great for those starting out learning an instrument
this is a fantastic product that is well made
this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition
the tool is extremely useful
with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from
i also know what notes are in each chord
the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys
the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze
i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair
this is a very useful product at a fair price
no i am not affiliated with the company at all
im just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool
in my opinion this is a five star product
im a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords
this educational device is truly an asset to all musicians especially guitar players
id suggest that this is not for beginners
more for the intermediate musician
it is not something you are going to understand at first
the learning curve is moderate
other than that quite useful and durable
i am confused by this hellish portal of confusion
if you want to understand any theory start here after learning basic chords
this is how basic chords relate to each other
if youre boss you need the info
let me start of by saying this tuner is great
my previous tuner was a korg ca40 and frankly that tuner is terrible
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
another issue with the ca40 is the poor screen
the screen is so dark and only viewable head on
what this tuner has  accuracy usability durability versatility
what more can you ask from a tuner of this price
over the years ive literally owned dozens of electronic tuners
generally five or six at a time in various locations
ranging from a 12 musiciansfriend promotional item to a 200 rack mount
most have been in the 30 range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko
at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case
beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare
and indeed it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching
amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students
a lot of students cant read or notice such small type
finally it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch
a lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade
right now its a mere 45
is working very good 100 satisfaction
have several tuners of different names and quality
but this seiko is certainly the quickest
the rubber housing is an excellent idea
in case one wasnt good enough they double it up
no need for a fancy pansy 50 metal mesh screen
this works just as good
and this with that extra filter on it it blocks even more
worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter
i use it on all my condenser mics
it works perfect for those hard ps and strong s sounds
its built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand
it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals
and it looks very professional
when set on blink they blink way too fast
i will not buy more
suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these
for the  should be more dependable
they are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice
i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though
it has a nice color throw too
it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but
this new led version is built with less quality
if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldnt be a problem
id prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it dont
its possible i have a defective one not sure
the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light
the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops
i guess i got a bad one
works great with my fender super champ x2 amplifier
however it does not come with a cable
by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic 300b
unfortunately it was the wong switch
but626262it has true fender quality
the switches are rock solid
this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action
rubber no skid bottom is a plus
i kept the switch because of the quality
i know it will come in handy sooner or later
i bought this to go with my super champ x2 combo
it also came with a cord
i was not happy the super champ x2 didnt come with it
both my hot rod deluxe and blues deville came with foot switches
now the x2 is my main amp
you need this to get the most out of your superchamp xd amp
no telling how long the switches will last
fender tends to make good products
price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo
i really like the footswitch
seems well made for the price and works as advertised
i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd
works great with my fender super camp x2
easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response
this one is pretty decent especially at the price point
im a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher
i was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size
i did this drawing on my guitarplaying knowledge
this was an impulse buy
my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great
despite that ive been highly impressed with its quality and sound
very light which is nice
intonation is spot on looks beautiful too
i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isnt one of them
after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase
this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks
it may not be a 5star intrument but its a 5star value
the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele
the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality
you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time
i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way
it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles
a guitar player for 20 years now i decided to give it a try
i found this one to be made well enough that it plays well
the frets are properly aligned and the instrument stays in tune
although this plays well i was disappointed with the workmanship
since i did not see similar comments from others perhaps mine is not representative
a less important issue has to do with the grain
its an optical illusion but not a sign of higher quality instrument making
if you are disappointed and want something better expect to pay at least double
i ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great
no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested
just buy the product and get on with happy music making
its well constructed and i have not encountered any issues with the twopiece bottom
if anything this pedal is as good as new
it is not so tight as to fatigue but the response is positive
the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase
this saved med at least 40 instead of getting a traditional preamp
overall i can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at
15 to 20 dollars then sure
still its an ok product
and in general im pretty satisfied with it
you shouldnt have any problems
i use this with my audio technica condensor
its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain
its not bulky which is a nice
so if necessary give it a tryand more than one
but make sure there are return privileges
this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop
simply plug it in and find the right drivers
it does seem like it can break easily
thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk
all in all it works and i am pleased
this isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what youre getting
it is lined and has a pouch for song books
a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar
good material good zippers good design
i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome
in a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold
however all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars
it is well crafted and cheap
i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric
all in all great value for a good item
it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection
storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks
it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price
it fits my jasmine es31c dreadnought acousticelectric guitar just fine
you really cant beat it for the price
for the most part this is a well builtdurable gig bag
i only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding
it has exceeded my expectations
it works for what i need
it arrived earlier than i expected
my guitar is safe now with this hard case
the case is very nice and sturdy
it has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come
it also has a lock on the case in case one might need it
great case didnt really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about
holds my seagal s6 very well
great guitar by the way for the price
this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date
in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it
my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case
the only problem i have is it smells terrible
other than that this was a great investment
i ordered this hard case for my fender t bucket
it fits exactly like an original fender hard case
looks like made of good materials
with interior pocket to put your accesories like capo string winder etc
for its price and qualityi giving it a 5 star  o
this is a great capo from shubb
the finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel
i like how it works
it adjusts to fit different guitar necks and just sort of snaps in place
i recommend this capo to anyone
thought about buying the expensive g7th capo but im very glad i didnt
the tried and true shubb works great at a great price
the difference between this one and clamp on style is night and day
this is a great capo
it is small and incredibly light weight you almost cant tell that its there
this capo isnt quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar
this capo works very well
it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design
my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capos design
this one is too slow for the stage
i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo
it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for
this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension
i bought two sets of these for two of my fender 4x10 bass cabinets
my hartke 410vx cabinet was designed by an idiot
9 million pounds and no casters
not even holes for them
who invented this thing heman
but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing
great quality casters for the money
you cant go wrong with these
i use to use a cloth to clean my strings
this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool
the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets
all and all for the price its a 5 star
i chose this because i wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings
so far it has worked beautifully
this is a very useful little device
i use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar
it removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately
this will increase the life of your strings
dont expect miracles but this helps quite a bit
this is great idea to clean guitar strings
simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings
i have used on all my guitars
it even fits my acoustic 12 string
update  1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong
wash up in soap and water and let dry
i bought a 2nd one
i have to say this string cleaner is a must have
ive seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead
this little tool will prevent that
i have a routine with mine
before i play i run the cleaner over the strings a few times
i am amazed at how good the strings feel now
they really are like a new set of strings
just use a cloth or paper towel
im on the fence with this product
nifty little item that does what its designed to do
i regret this purchase for what i paid for it
i bought this since i am a new guitar player
it does hit the frets but doesnt seem to do any damage
my only small complaint is that they dont use a center punch
overall this is a great pedalboard
the board i received came supplied with plenty of softsided velcro
there is another review here where the user states they didnt receive enough velcro
im old school when it comes to these boxes
i run compression wah overdrive superoverdrive delay  reverb pretty much in that order
sometime i use a phaser or a tremolo
i currently have 8 pedals setup on this board
i have room for one maybe two more
the board itself is built like a tank and travels well
i found that i had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal
low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned
you can run any number of power sources to it
there is plenty of room for all my needed connections
i leave the choice of that to you the reader
without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case
i wrote the company described the problem
lizzie wrote back and said shed take care of it
you just dont get better service than this company provides
combine that with the great product design and im a happy customer
the larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath
this is one of its best features
yes i spent more than i ever have on a pedal board before
i still like the pt2 much better
maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain
once you place the pedals on it its kinda heavy
but it wont hurt your back
i arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly
no brainer built to last and the carrying case its outstanding
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply
i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus
first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board
the fitment to the power supply is there
once youve got them in or attempted to do so theyre never coming out
youll probably have to break them
its a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive
you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it
needless to say im not very pleased
you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volumewah pedals
read the description so you can have a sense of size
tue quality is very nice solid and resistible
the soft case is very nice also
i returned the skb ps45 and got the pt2 as a replacement
providing the brackets to mount
this is your best option for a top flight pedalboard
its kind of an 34empty34 sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects
see my review of that item for clarification
from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit
put a battery in and plugged it in
but the sound was horrible
maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly but i dont think so
i think thats the way it really sounds
i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product
the dr600 was my first behringer pedal
i think it works great
it has given me no problem
to me it wasnt even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs
yes the battery is difficult to replace
however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet
i solved the battery problem by using a 1spot 8outlet pedal power supply
it doesnt sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest
behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit
what the hell was behringer thinking
i bought this as for practice
i have a 180 amp but was looking for something a little more portable
this is what i came to
it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too
the lead cuts clean 34mostly34
in general is does tend to get a little noisy though
for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever
i hope it never breaks
i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul
best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody
one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile
for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup
great for a quick practice and really sounds nice
wide overdrive and tone range
i have to of them
are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication
i did purchase the protection plan for 10 so im covered for 2 years
i was a bit disappointed in this gadget
this is a good product
the construction is pretty good
it will give you a variety of bass tones
its onoff switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which i never use
it has both gain and volume output controls and both work
it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything
edit 20130407  still working fine
in my house i dont have to play quietly when rehearsing
i rehearse often with this thing
i paid 50 for it and it works great
worth the money for certain
i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid
this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices
worth the small price you pay
as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on
sounds just like an amp in your headphones
onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things
i use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands
maybe a dollar if they dont just give it to you
the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera
you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc
to hold it in place when in storage or transport
you could also leave it attached to your camera
either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost
it holds well when bumped or moved
mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose
most modern devices will do just fine
again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well
dont put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years
im happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas
i use this often to record my bands gigs
works well pretty straight forward
bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied
i am only using for lightweight applications
no issues with the screw not tightening either
i plan to buy more of these in the near future
holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording
this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod
its a great idea but not well executed
a friend gave me a few of these and overall i like them
id give them 35 stars if i could
having said that i dont like them as much as a regular nylon pick
so i picked these up
i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand
hands down the best pick ive used
i guess i have tried about every type of pick around
i ended up using that pick for something like 3 years playing 12 timeswk
i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one
first saw on youtube video how genius
a pick that stays in hand
makes me wonder how ever played without them
small price for big help
i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy
but it has the star for grip and that is super
i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey
first the material that the neck rests in is very soft
very good and very useful device
definitely holds the guitar well
a little pricey but probably worth it
it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze
this is what i have needed for many years
i think it is reasonably priced as well
thanks for a great product and good prompt service cheers
i was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle
the hue control gently affects the tone
nice quality at an unbelievable price point
this pedal is no exception
to be fair i have not tried many other vibes
hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal
vibe is very trower like
chorus is on the mellower side
very analog sounding not digital
replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better
solid well built and should last
i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues
summary  just the factsa great pedal and my favorite univibe of all
does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise
overall i love this pedal at under 60 bucks
quality seems ok but time will tell on durability
switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato
but it sounds great to me
i have done it for you
some users report quality issues here  i guess time will tell on that
i was able to match exactly an authentic original univibe sound with some adjusting
it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also
some days i hate it
but i like the build quality and the speed control
mixed bag and at 200 shouldnt be
mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014
it is second place on my list
the m68 gives the jimi a good run
mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue
they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty
it was also a tight fit
thats a subjective thing i suppose
but still 2x the cost of the jimi
i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value
dunlop univibe uv1  cool stainless steel construction
knobs were hard to see settings
non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick
the seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days
so i returned it and they lost the sale
othewise i would still be thinking about this one
i was on the fence about whether it was my winner
at 220 id have to love it to keep it
the eq effect just kills the pedal for me
not my pick at 150
bbe soul bender  my least favorite vibe
it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass
in a band mix im pretty sure it would get totally lost
at home might sound ok
form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed
my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led
with intensity below 50 it was usable
i returned this one early
limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me
intensity range seemed less than other pedals too
std power supply a plus
led indicators good and flash the speed
overpriced 15 to 2x in my opinion
a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceage sounding
univibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting
didnt care for the behringer time machine
my gear used for testing  fender american deluxe stratocaster
mesa minirectifier amplifier mesa rectifier 2x12 cabinet with celestion v30s
pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies
once they did communicate they were very unprofessional
a google earth view of their addressed explained it all
mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex
the vibe sound doesnt get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2
for me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz
do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this
rugged pedal by a little known company
took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye
would like to see stereo output options in future models
other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside
also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models
affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingcons  this model is one compartment
for speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model
lack of any impact resistance  the bag has no padding at all
bag was getting kind of heavy at that point
when laying empty it is 50 long x about 12 wide and lays flat
decent holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles
i purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason
this case solves that problem
when i mentioned light duty in the title i truly meant it
moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward
transporting them in this case isnt
very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles
at 20 this bag looks like a great value
i didnt realize they would hold large tripod stands
excellent bag for tripods or stands that dont need a lot of protection
i am extremely pleased with this amp
even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud
however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone
the fender vibro champ is a great little amp
im amazed at how good this amp sounds
these are nice clean tubes that react consistently
the amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 watts
the cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings
the first five have three different levels of style each
our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack
this is a clean simple amp to use
the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right
the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched
some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet
switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot
sadly the volume only goes to 10
this is probably the least useful part of the amp
theres no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song
there is a gain knob
i like the speaker on this amp
it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound
very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker
the back panel also has a 14 inch jack line out
this is a great small gig or practice amp
bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones
they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in
it sounded just as good as those other amps
even the other players checked it out
pick up a used one
they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are
the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tinlike
has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models
a couple of the marshall settings arent bad either
check one out and youll want it
warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive
the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up
the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me
and it mikes well too by the way
the choice is yours there
love the reverb in the fx section
once again the controls are easy and direct
you want that go waste your money on a line 6 or something
this champ is made for one thing
i believe it has accomplished that well
im just glad that i got one of these from amazon
com when i did and will not part with the amp
this model is a keeper to be sure
and i dont even like digital
hows that for an endorsement
its that good for what it does
i got this for 150 dollars when it was on sale
be careful with the load you put on your amp though
plus its on sale right now so snatch one before theyre all gone
so stop thinking about it and just go buy it
use them all the time
goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface
like my title says this gets the job done and is well built
nice cables for the price
also the xlr connectors are of the highest quality
they engage and disengage without binding or looseness
i bought this to 34daisychain34 two small kustom powered pa cabinets
virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application
this cable filled the bill perfectly
so far i havent had any issues at all
it has low noise clean soundgood transmission
i bought this guitar nearly a year ago
it was my first guitar
i never cared much for the sound
it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune
youll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc
or just buy a better guitar to begin with
had it for about two weeks and im about to return it now
things that i liked 1
sounds clear and crystal good unplugged
things i dont like much 1
im new to electric but my les paul does change tunes
in a much much more obvious way3
talking about plugged sound its no where close to unplugged
notes are pretty mixed up and not separatedclear very loud though
im glad i dont need to stuck with this anymore
thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars
i am so in love with my 34pinkie34
the latest 34bargain basement34 squier strat bullet is no exception
as other reviewers have indicated a squier bullet
is ready to give guitars several times its street value fullon competition
if youve read some of my other reviews you know im a serial hotrodder
and this is my favorite victim
because its such a sound platform to begin with pun intended
the basic stuff on the bullet is very good
and for many its all thats required
but lets quest after some serious bigleague sound
the first things to upgrade are the pickups
the lace hot gold value pack with a hot gold hot bridge pickup
and the lace patriot red silver and blue value pack
you simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it
but wait a minute hold the phone
what about the stock pick guard
please memorize this  chandler guitars pickguard heaven
theyre wonderful folks and they do excellentlyaffordable work
the next thing to do is to block the tremolo whammy mechanism
proper vibrato comes from the fingers
hey now youre eric clapton
a more forward lead guitar sound
if you play rhythm dont bother
so whats then point of all this
my first elec guitar im 60 years old and this guitar is perfect
if theirs better ones out there then i cant wait to get one
who said learning the guitar was difficult
piece of cake if u practice
buy this guitar u wont be sorry you did
its a nice guitar for the money
nice size action and finish
great for a beginner electric
needed new strings but everything else was smooth
pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well
it feels great looks great and sounds great
what more can i say
if youre just starting out this guitar is perfect for you
this guitar just got stolen from me
tuners old style not sealed
pup plate maladjusted and off quite a bit
id suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions
on the positive action and intonation good
much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level
however ive purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less
that said youll probably do ok
epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier
this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well
just a few words squier by fender
new strings and scratch free
made in china it says
3setup the intonation using a tuner
you really need a tuner for this step
after that the guitar was splendid
i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning
after 2 weeks im still loving the guitar
latest review downgraded from 5 to 3 stars
i bought a washburn rx40 with duncan usm
the bullet is nice but i outgrew it
the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive
id recommend to save some money and buy something above 200
guitars at that price may be twice the cost
but is more than twice better
the 2 important things are not in bullet  the sustain and the sound
latest review the product is back at 5 stars
i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action
fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short
there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short
these cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp
not too long not too short
it works got on time
it connected well in the nady smpsx1 phantom power unit i bought
ill update how i hook it up
balanced signal is so much better
no more issues with ground loops or other problems
just clear as a bell
they were cheap and the build quality is fine
what makes a good cable
this is just what the doctor ordered
not much to say about a xlr cable
good price came quickly through prime
nice cord sturdy build good sound
electrons go through it and dont leak out so its perfect i guess
with phantom mic its well done
i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures
its working for me ill be buying more for our studio
its a simple cable what can be said
it was a good deal did the job
i use it with home recording and it is great for my needs
i recommend this to anyone who records at home
often we get what we pay for
these cables seem to be qualitymade
i have yet to try them with my microphone
got this because i thought the length would be enough
it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length
had no problems with this cable though
no audible hum detected when using this mic cord either
feels solid and will probably last for many years to come
for the price i think its hard to get any better than this
it fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes
its light and feels comfortable when you carry it
had mine for 2 years now and no complaints still as good as new
the look is not that inspiring but it protects your guitar
some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but ive had no problems with mine
i tried this at the store
the interior was nothing special either
nice case but doesnt provide the protection that i need for my guitars
a nobrainer for fender guitars
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
both ended up in checked luggage
i just ordered another skb fender case
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
the case is also very well balanced with the guitar inside
if i purchase another strat i will purchase this case again
10232012  still holding up well
acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one
meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee
doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo
juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh
this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly
i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price
i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return
i might have to sell one of my lexuses
what the hell is the plural of lexus
a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire
this arm is a direct replacement for the original
fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed
but my mexistrat is now complete
enter the fender frontman 212r
secondly its fender reliable with a 5 year warranty
no tubes means no tube issues
other things worth mentioning its not as heavy as my vox all tube amp
i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another
they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too
this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down
if you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you
you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop
i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks
well here it is friends in all its glory
tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want
tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp
young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price
if you play cw look no further
if you fingerpick this is your amp
electrified banjo mandolin or violin
but if you follow the darker side keep looking
the clean side of the amp is exactly that  very very clean
this amp has tons of power to spare
cant even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like
only thing i miss a bit is a headphone jack
i have been playing for 9 years
have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state
has a great clean tone with a lot of low end
reverb sounds great as well
remember this amp is not for metal
if high gain is what your after then stay away
100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist
but this wouldnt be a very good review without having some cons
these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying
power switch is on the back
effects loop is on the front
not the end of the world but i just dont understand why
footswitch jack is on the front
footswitch includes channel and boost buttons
a third button for reverb would have been amazing
cab is made of super cheap particle board
these tuners look and feel great
i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build
they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break
the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar
warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one
no instructions came with the package
found a method done by another searching online
this meant drilling out the holes by another 18 of an inch
blue tape both sides as to prevent marring
there are also with two dimples
then carefully drilled two holes per tuner
install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze
for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions
unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish
but you can get them ultimately
not all gold hardware is the same color gold
the quality is good and they look and function well
however i returned them because they are not locking
these are great tuners and they look great
almost all of the reviews i read were positive
the build quality is solid  it feels like a much more expensive amp
many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed
this is my first fender amp and probably not my last
the sound quality is amazing
the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain
there is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too
i will also say that if you can find one used  buy it
ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it
the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp
the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube
thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web
there is also a 14 line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment
unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop
the amplifier use three tubes  1x 12ax7 and 2x 6v6s
its speaker is a 10 inch 8ohmspecial design fender
you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think
some players are comfortable with the stock speaker
i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp
it will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the master
it  weighs only 25 pounds 109kg so its portability is very good
this ampwas a wonderful deal at 300 when i originally bought it in 2011
it is still a good dealtoday  if you can find one used
thats not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps
this amp ranks up there with the best of them
the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording
its 15 watts but its loud
doesnt cost 11000 dollars other
it does a marshall pretty well
marshalls based on 59 bassman without the delicate touch so theres no wonder
0 6 7 9 and 12 are amazing voices
it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe
this is a future classic
fender has done an amazing job with this amp
add to this 16 digital presets
add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus
and they are absolutely right
not a model of a champ amp the real deal
the implications of this amp are really huge
but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character
the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome
people ask is it loud enough to gig with
it can get loud enough over drums etc
but id mic it anyway
i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume
mic it and you can play it anywhere
lack of a mid control
to my ears its not in the same spot on all presets
this amp is cool and unique
fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability
truly a unique and versatile creation
well i love da fender products always have always will
i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly
the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part
it isnt completely black though
there is a white stripe running around the outer edge
not a problem for me but it may be for some
a genuine fender part that looks great on my 10 mim strat
good price and it arrived quickly as well
you cant go wrong with genuine fender parts
not much to say about this one
its a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well
promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it
compliments my bwb pickgaurd nicely
nope doesnt fit a squire affinity just fyi
fit my mim strat perfectly not much else to say
does what its suppose to
this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps
for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill
but this is the switch for that amp
ive never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is
marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts
folks this thing is built like a tank
the casing is made of heavy duty i dont know what gauge solid steel
theres nothing rinky dink about it
again light went out and back to the original
it cost me 2090 with shipping
im a fender fan but this beats their single switch
this replacement so far is hanging in there
it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised
mr miyagi couldnt have said it any better
robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble 75
nice foot switch for the mustang amp
able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily
switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm
would have received a 5star rating had it been in a metal enclosure
it is plastic but it suits my needs
simple light and does what its suppose to
not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions
cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components
i have run into the 90 deg
i have 4 on hand
since i paid about 13 for this i was not expecting a great deal
construction is about as good as i would normally get on a 13 item
im not grading the switch on that
this works great with the mustang i amp
switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot
a great addition to an already great amp
at this price its kinda like the amp itself  a no brainer
i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp
i bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar
i wanted to test for myself
so i ended up returning it the next day
for a regular guitar this would be fine but not bass
if youre a metalhead stay away
this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion
but if you demand metal get far away
should have paid the extra 40 and bought the mustang  oh well
the amp has light sound and not much control
good for my small space though
it has a headphone jack also
fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one
other then that it is all rock
physically it is built strong too
for the money this thing sounds just fine
i got it for my son to toy around with
i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it
it has a lot of power and noise behind it
i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion
with distortion it sounds great
exactly what i needed for testing guitars and playing at home
this fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along
it sounds great and i like the headphone and mp3 player hookups
great price but unfortunately this product didnt work for me
this works in some applications but doesnt work in many others
even when detected by the software it will not work with line 6 equipment
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks
also with my win7 x64 machine
i simply couldnt get this to work most of the time
active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely
i should have totally returned this product
instead its in a landfill
i bought one of these a couple of years ago
i used it to connect my behringer bcr2000 in midi mode naturally
to my computer for mixing duties in reaper
it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints
midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine
thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok
when they work theyre absolutely great and theyre so cheap
if you receive a lemon return it and order another
its worth it if youre not in a hurry
as long as you get one that works
the cable came in the time it was promised
it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows7 computer
my music program had no problem detecting it and using it
sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time
i was able to connect it to my pc
i had problems getting it to work on my imac
it recognized the devices presence but it didnt produce any sound on the computer
i am very pleased with the product
it has performed better than i had expected
i shall probably order more from this company in the future
doesnt wotk with vamp 3
doubt it works at all
red light always stays on and ive never seen the green light
it works perfect with cakewalk music creator 5 and a digitech vocalist
no regrets on the buy at all
my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications
cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another
cheap works great for playing and foot controllers
my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable
if the puppy murders this one ill order up another one just like this
i needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs
for the money i dont think it can be beat
bone does make a considerable difference i have found
all the finish is excellent
now for some down sides
yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends
as for leveling it seemed ok
cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it
it clings to the gloss finish nicely
overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down
i put a baggs ibeam pickup in it also
easy installation and nice natural sound
ive been playing guitar for 40 years
this was my 1st decent classical guitar
the tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar
the finish is pretty and i like the solid cedar top
it records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models
the case is nice as well
so far ive had no problems
i bought new strings but havent replaced them yet
the old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and 34alive34
im sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound
just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical
from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed
the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome
seems to stay in tune pretty well too
but its a fine guitar
i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing
the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning
it came with savarez strings  not the best ive used but good
and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag
its strong and durable and well designed
it has a nice resonant sound good playability and very attractive finish
it required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup
it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range
while it isnt it the prettiest guitar out there its by no means ugly
even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar
the smell of this guitar is also amazing
all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar
it is a highquality gig bag with lots of padding
i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely
the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand
the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks
wow is what my teenage son said when he opened this on christmas morning
he loved the variety  number of picks
this was a terrific deal
ive been using these picks for eight months and they last forever
i lose them before they wear out
ill be buying and recommending these for a long time
they seem to be decent quality
this was a great purchase
a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar
made of leather or highquality pleather so it seems builttolast
i use it on my seagull and it totally works great
i would definitely recommend but its kind of expensive for what it is
if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you
you could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed
also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove
nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all thats needed
make things easier and cleaner looking  thats what
i bought the martin strap to match the color
the connection strap is a great enhancement for my d18 and fits wonderfully
wonderful setup and i highly recommend it to to all martin owners
why didnt i think of this
is what it is and does what it says its does
this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings
over the strings it would slide below the nut which isnt good
under the strings and it muffled a few
so we kind of wove it above some and under others
other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems
and it puts the name 34martin34 on the lowliest box guitar
this beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my martin
strings might look tacky but theyll stay on there if tied properly
it goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily
it is a great idea and worth the cost
i hate having to drill a hole in my guitars
this is what i have been looking for for my accoustic guitar
makes my life easier when i pack up and set up the equipment
once you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhere
easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap
this audio adapter works perfectly
why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio
the audio adapter is well built
windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately
its working great but it does not work in stereo
it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive
works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro
this product has a monomicrophone input and a stereo headphone output
it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port
since the headset has a monomicrophone this adapter works great
the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems
this product is great for using a softphone or other communications program
the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected
works seemless and great with a headset
it works great for that
havent used it for anything else though so cant comment there
seems sturdy and well made as well
the audio jack on my laptop was failing
by that time half the youtube video was over
a plugandplay usb device with both input and output audio jacks
took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron which recognized it immediately
problem solved quickly and elegantly
shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner
and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports
then order this great little solution to a big problem
ive owned just about every muff
no triangle or civil war
but this is my favorite muff thus far
way more versatile than any other muff
i love wicker on and tone off
i cant wait to see what they do next
these new ehx pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass
if you like muffs youll really like this one
i use it the most of all my pedals because its pretty much perfect
i can get 4 completely different sounds out of it
its also truebypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off
just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal
it is a fuzz pedal
so dont buy it expecting overdrive
none of that makes me dislike the pedal
its one of the hest fuzz pedals ever
as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur
ive never owned one before this
i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect
the enclosure is a smaller pedalboardfriendly size
the tone knob does nothing
my big muff pi with wicker had hellacious noise i mean unusable
the bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised
mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are
ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing
strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils
this guitar support couldnt be simpler
the neck support cup goes through that hole
thats it for set up
the mat protects the guitar body
the guitar can be placed in strings up or down
honestly this looks really sharp put together
the whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube
that tube is an excellent storage tube
its a foam cushion with a neck supporter
it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage
i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc65
it holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments
it also is easy to store when finished
yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows
but this tool is very well designed
that increases their resale value so the tool pays for itself
without this tool i dont think i would have been so lucky
it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up
supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar
this is a must have
it is pack very well and i use it everyday
long wait for overpriced item
arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait
overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
good price too nothing to complain about
yup its ok  nothing special
purchased this for my son to use on his guitars
has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars
prompt shipping great price great product
the classic fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth
well its size as i measured it is actually 12 inches by 1458 inches
the missing38 of an inch is a minor detail
go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s
now you wontactually find any actual 2x4s
theyve been shrinking for over 50 years
i also gave it the nose test
below is thewarning verbatim from amazon
kudos to amazon for posting this warning
just thought i let you know about that one
well the gibson cloth does have a whipstitch edging around it
other than that notmuch difference
it gets one less star because of the california prop 65 warning
i will definitely be washing my hand right after using it
for the future i am not so sureabout me
thank you and say goodnight gracie
it was 4 dayspast the delivery date
for such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service
i will use them again in the future
nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well
not much to say here other than it works and works well
my kids were excited to split this pack of picks
these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing
the guitar picks were exactly what i was looking for
i like hard picks and these were the ones i needed
great picks would buy em again
bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding
always looking for reasonable pricing
these are very nice looking guitar picks
ive used these and dont have any problem with them
this package of picks is of good colors and good weight
they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff
10 picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company
cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me
what else can be said about them theyre good picks
good price for an pack of pickups
these are good picks and produce a great tone
theyre better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers
nice quality and good price too
i play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great
i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present
you cant beat the price
i cant really explain why they just feel right
sometimes they break but what pick light pick doesnt unless its nylon
the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well
i have not had them very long but seem to do well
100 picks for 20 dolares
im really happy with my new picks
its really cheap and the quality is good
they are what you order
these guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing
the colors are nice as well
guitar pics what more can i say
never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft
they do what they are meant to do
i like the jim dunlop
60mm pitch black guitar picks best
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
excellent guitar picks of medium hardness
picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly
if you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more
i bought these lightpicks because of the price
i guess thats to be expected for a light pick
love the colors and the price cant be beat
wished maybe they came in yellow
other than that great picks
these picks have served me very well
i am happy with the quality of all of them
i prefer the cactus picks
these slide around in my finger to much right now
these are high quality picks
medium is my personal choice  they did not disappoint me
will buy this brand again
they are clean cut smooth finish
i reach for these first
would and will buy again and recommend
hey its a pick its 10 to a bag
i lost one already so now i have 9
i my world thats good stuff
good medium picks decent feel and sound
would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling
these picks were a good deal
they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks
theyre my favorite picks and i always buy the medium ones
im sure other picks works just fine but these are always my preference
very nice guitar picks for the very fair price
i like them very much
of course i am just a beginner
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order
our teenager really likes these
have not broken one yet
these are high quality thick guitar picks
unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging
almost didnt know what it was because of this
just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught
they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand
maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying
the picks feel great and im having a good time
not bad for the price they have it for
multi color and easy to use
i bought these guitar picks for my son
he really likes them a lot
i would definitely buy them again
ive been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks
not special but not disappointing either
as long as your hands dont sweat a lot youll be fine with these
but a real assorted pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors
a real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses
i like to experiment with different types of picks
these assorted picks are really all the same just different colors
they always give me good picks to use
i bought these for my music class
the teens really liked the colors to choose from and i like the price
nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style
i would recommend these for any guitar player
not much to say here
haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks
i bought these to fill the dunlop 5005 pick holder that i also purchasd
and the price was right
also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical
received them in four days
just in time for my first lesson
i like the quality of the picks
not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style
since then ive used nothing else
ive found that the light picks
50mm are perfect for me
ill definitely continue to buy this brand in the future
trying out a few new types of picks and different weights
i found this pick very responsive flying through the scales on my les paul
the picks weight was perfect
these are slick and seem harder to keep track of
what do you say about a little chip of celluloid
well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks
these do it for me
they also seem to make a good clean sound
these picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction
its easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks
i would call the black ice picks medium sized
this is what the black ice delivers
a suggestion from my teacher
i bought this on a whim
with the xtra heavy picks i was losing what little treble these strings had
the tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful
i keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases
they dont taste like grapes however
they are comfortable to use
ive got a gig tomorrow night so well see how they work then
i have always been happy with the planet waves products
these are great picks and yes they are slippery
i liked these a lot
how much can you say about a patch cable
this is a good one at a good price
they work well but they are not mogami
we both seem pretty happy with it
these are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard
they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and im not noticing any extra noise
so they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables
use them for home recording  nothing on the road
for that purpose these are made well
by the way these are listed as
5 feet 6 but actually are 10
oooops my bad when i discovered they were only 2 longer
they do the job and are made well
if youre not using a pedal board these are just what you need
i bought two sets 6 total great cables no added hum
i will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal board
price is right for sure
what can i say these are great patch cables
solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect
they also seem to be quality without bulky
these cords strike that balance perfectly
quality and value so you cant go wrong
update ive lowered my 4 star rating down to 3
about half have worked great the other half have this odd little issue
im very pleased with this purchase
the cables are flexible quiet and no pops or loss of signal
not much else to say
ive bought a number of these for use on my pedal board
they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone
recommmended if you dont mind a molded cable
i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome
i would recommend these to anyone
these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others
no loss of tone through these cables
if it will reach its great
right size well made and these do the job
i prefer them at 90 degrees so these are just right
trustable quiet good materials durable etc
and honestly for me thats what i need
i bought a bunch of these when i started building my pedal board
theyre very inexpensive but seemingly quite high quality
tons of bang for your buck
seemingly no tone loss no added noise and no coloration
but for average boards they work great
i gig and record with these
only negative check bc the ends are too bulky
i bought a second pair of these
all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price
i have a real problem with these patch cables
most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man
they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse
i will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables
they are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet
i need to order a couple more packs though
there is no click assuring that the cable is in place
and theres a reason for that it isnt
slips right out of every pedal i have
i have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables
these are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong
these are currently the only cables i use on my pedalboard
worked perfectly for my needs
when it comes to quality of cables im really not to picky about it
if you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine
these cables are really the best
they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect
i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price
these help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board
they snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality
just what id expect from the company
i bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar
ive never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion
i definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together
i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone
these are very well made with the heads well secured
the plastic is thick and of a nice material
great little product and i would buy them again
this is a really good patch cable
i have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords
they are solid durable and reliable and cheap as well
bought it after read reviews
i had signal loss using these cables
its like having a loose connection inside the cable
my connections were on and off i thought i had a dead pedal
i have to wiggle and hold to get signal
its too flexible almost like twizzlers no kidding
daddario always makes great products at great prices
great for linking closequarter effect pedals
no noise and very durable
great product for the price
they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill
good buy for the price and nothing else is required
good quality with sealed connectors
needed patch cables for my pedal board
they did what i expected them to do
not to bulky and the right angle plugs save space
i highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others
planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior  can pay
these sound good by that i mean they dont have any sound at all
the design is such that they will wear well
im very pleased with these
ive been buying these strings for a while now
they sound clean and crisp
the best part is the price
great for beginners and experts
the sound is great and is easy on the fingers
you cant beat the price
i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way
i am not a fussy person about guitar strings
martin is at the top of the heap
these strings sound light and bright
very pleased with this purchase
they are a wonderful product
good grippy picks for some types of playing
i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming
hand angle can also play a part in this
so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over
the dava changes that for me
a definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick
these are a new style of guitar pick to me
thought id give it a try
the seller did not fail me in any way
was recommended to these picks by other users so i gave them a shot
i like this a lot
still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick
the rubber grip area is a joy to hold
they are instead control picks
different materials produce different soundsfeels
also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other two
these picks have a good grip
theyre pointy so theyre good for fast picking
theyre very small about the size of a nickle so youve been warned
as with other dava picks they wear out pretty quickly
thats the price you pay for a flexible pick i guess
a very nice pick both in feel texture and design
im very satisfied with this pick
this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track
five stars without a doubt
only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad
i really like the h4ns design the menus and controls are nicely organized
it feels more sturdy than the h2
the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent
most other recorders in this price range dont have xlr inputs
4 stars because ive only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode
stamina mode is supposed to run for 11 hours
if not for that id have rated 4 stars
in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent
in terms of the other features i cannot comment
this thing has so many uses its ridiculous
easy to use interface and very well constructed
i play in a really loud metal band
none of us are record savvy or anything like that
we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out
simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just
for such a little thing
no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it
i still need to read a lot of the users manual
we recorded in 4ch mode with two extra mics
i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet
now rocking and basic recording its how its supposse to be
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both
the h4n is a great versatile field recorder
the h4n is a work horse
it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats
i had this happen once
if this happens to you dont worry
i had it shipped off and back in 7 days
all in all the h4n is a great field recorder
i mainly use it in 4 channel mode
running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly
i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n
as i said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen
i record at 48k  16bits in
i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues
i do not regret this purchase at all
the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable
i highly recommend purchasing one
the latter offers the now popular xz mic configuration but theyre fixed mics
also with its size and brightblue color its anything but a stealth machine
this brings us to the 4th and most expensive zoom the h4n
great recorder on so many levels
i use it for external audio recording for dslr video
i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics
dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible
something i will have to get used to
my last comment is in regards to the h4n as a usb interface
however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it
this pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
its a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it
i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine
the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good
the korgstyle dialin reverb controls are easy but extremely limited
you get either room or hall
going from manual patchlevel to banklevel is awkward
it may just take practice
next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected
did boss just start making multieffects pedals
despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me70 does have features that recommend it
some of the drives are usable
the controls are accessible and easy to adjust
the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches
im looking forward to learning more about this pedal
so far it does some good things but it could be much better
has anyone else noticed the me70 reviews out there arent too useful
225 at gc for example
new fail update  the tremolo in this unit just stinks
whatever the waveform is its not a sine wave not smooth at all
whatever engineer was in charge of this  you screwed up big time
why would you do that boss
i like tremolo but its virtually useless in this unit
i could never get the levels right
the boss me70 is easy to use
my current band does not even play that many songs
im a professional musician playing 68 times a month
i really like the 38 second looping function
not sure why its not
double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would
excellent multieffect great sounds the distortions are really great
modulation and delays rocks they sound good
like always boss products are just amazing
effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion
the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic
you get 30 days to register it
eventually i ended up uninstalling it
soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue  muffled audio recording
no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it
the generic ones installed were from 2010
i began reading online about muffled audio on windows 7 pcs
i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more
much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem
no hiss hum breath noises or distortion
impressively clear recordings unlike any ive been able to obtain using aplantronics
for the price i dont think you can do better
its compact has great voice pickup and audio recording clarity
cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it
i guess if anything thats been the downside to this purchase
i was surprised when i tested this microphone
it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range
the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright
however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors
for 30 bucks this mic is great
we didnt really expect much except a quick way to record ideas
its simple easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound
weve used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity
ive even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype
the mic does exactly what i wanted it to do
the mic has a headphone jack
having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings
also i like having the two polar patterns switchable from cardioid to omni
once i got the hang of it i had no problems
i did find the bundled cakewalk software useless
please refer to my review of cakewalk music creator 6 here on amazoncom
overall this is an awesome product
id even say it was cute
but how does it perform
there was no perceptible delay
no need to find a special driver either
plug it in and its ready to go
sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti
i tried all three modes  carodid carodid  10bd pad and omni
no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping
best sound on all instruments was obtained from 610 feet using the omni mode
the two together make a nice portable recordingproduction combination
packaging is well thought out too
this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band
that was surprising since its a usb mic
it is also very sensitive when set to room recording
its smaller and lighter than the snowflakemore diminutive than the picture would suggest
its extremely sensitive slightly more so than the snowflake
although the snowflake doesnt use a spring clip it suffers from the same limitation
the samson is the more delicate and refined of the two
just got this in this week
looks nice and works as intended
for 22 bucks cant really go wrong
i really wanted this to be a great product
the screws strip out too easily
even the pop filter fell off
otherwise dont have an adjustable tilt option
just make it one solid piece
its just not strong enough
not that its a surprise though
not much of anything is worth the money these days
they already have your money
besides what are they going to do
replace it with another broke a product
better yet refund my money for the product i paid  minus shipping
i want a refund plus an hourly wage
companies that dont test their products dont deserve your business
how did you test it
is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence
great mount for the price
filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup
quality good especially given fairly low price
im loving this pop filter
it looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand
the built in shock mount is definitely a plus
this immediately lets them know to just speak into the microphone
also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want
amazon was great in conjunction with the seller
my item arrived lightning fast
i got these for the build in pop screen
however i found it can only be attached in one place
this is ok if you are using a full boom that8217s facing the singer
it fits my mxl mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem
believe it or not ive yet to use this screen
i was short a shock mount for one of my cad condensers
ive yet to use that mic again
but i love the way screen and mount look
but im still giving it 5 stars
its no better or worse than a tripod stand at twice the cost
this is a good deal
i got mine for less than 20 bucks
the stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended
other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle
sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work
for the money you can not beat this
the quality is great for the money
for the price this stand cant be beat
you need a boom stand
these mic stands worked perfectly
i have three mic stands with this one being the fourth
i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible
the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down
the bottom clamp never did secure properly
it kept opening up even without a mic on it
the weight of the stand itself stripped it
i sent it back without hesitation
well built made to last and looks great
i highly recommend this item
these are pretty good quality tweed cables
they also make one with the 90 degree 14 inch input as well
ive owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk
for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex
a lifetime warranty means youll have it forever
very well built cable and so far no hum at all
like the retro tweed look and the sleeves that go under the ts jackets
i was getting hum from some of my cheaper cables
this cable is a great cable for the price
flexible good tone good quality
it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box
the chord works great no noticeable buzz
i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear
i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly
the plugs are also of the highest quality
they mate perfectly with 14 receptacles on guitars and amps
i mentioned that these are for inside playing
otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance
let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect
first it works extremely well
no popping or clicking at all
very flexible but solid feel to it
it looks better in person than in the pic too
and with the lifetime guarantee you really cant go wrong here
i use the 21 cable
great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great
this is my first fatsoflex cable
so many over the years i cant recall
the look and feel of this cable is excellent
seems very solid but its always difficult to tell with cables
the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic
it sounds fine no issues
no issues in that regard with the fatso
one last thing  youve gotta love amazon
so i wasnt choosey about the colors i got
oh and one thing im a bit iffy about is spectraflexs lifetime warranty
this a great instrument cable
if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one
the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of 34regular34 cables
this is one great looking cable
well not when itcomes to cables
you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud
helps keep those ugly microphonics away and you want that big time
the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pfft
this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables
the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable
out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output
it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed
this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money
this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style
the bulkiness of this cabledoesnt seem to lend itself to easy coiling
if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava
pretty doesnt count for much with me
for many years ive been playing with proel and 34fender34 cables
until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency
this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components
best of all warranty for life
i imagine that they will last for years
this cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect clean sound
ive used this for about 3 months now
what more can i say
looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss
a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords
i am really liking the size of this board
the board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles
the case is also really well made good zippers and stitching
id buy this again in a heartbeat
is this guraunteed for life or something
it should be for the price
i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products
sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother
this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro
im not on tour with any group
the case is awesome too
i had it up and running in a few minutes
clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect
since i first got it ive rearranged once already
the only reason this is not a 5star review is because of the drings
that being said dont let that detract you from buying this
i just feed the shoulder strap through the carryhandle and it works well enough
hence the purchase of the pedaltrain mini
this board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply
overall this is a great board
i currently have a looper overdrive distortion echo and tuner on my unit
ive added a photo of my board
the board itself is made out of welded metal and its very sturdy
the velcro seems to be of decent quality too
even the bag is nice
the single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag
and possibly an envelope filter at some point
the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs
it looks very neat and tidy
using george ls makes it look even better
i will buy one of these again
this is a review for themahalo u30pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink
for the price 30 shipped it cant be beat
free shipping via amazon prime
i got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas and she loves it
i taught her the cchord and i play the gchord
so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you
the strings are some kind of cheap nylon
i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound 1000x better
almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost
it has geared tuners not friction pegs
it even comes with a matching polyester gigbag
now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter
overall a decent playstarter uke and worth the 30
for the price this is a steal
its something ive recently been regretting more than ever
the sound of the ukulele is great
its not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are
its a fingerprint magnet but thats about the only gripe i have
for the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose
you have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere
this would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument
i will update if any problems arise in time
this will be more than fine
edit  apparently this thing fluctuates between 2030
i was 2495 when i got it
if its 30 wait a few days and see if it goes down
thats just how it is
the more  you spend the better
the unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument
this is a great little ukulele to have around the house
the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too
i used the daddario j53 black nylon strings
the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated
its a fun strum and well worth the 20
got this for my wife she just loves it
the string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns
this is a great little uke for the money
ive bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts
as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in
i should have researched this a little bit more
it was a toy not an instrument
my kids are all interested in learning the uke
this one really appealed to my son because of the front design
plays well and keeps in tune
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap
just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this
i got it for my son and he wasnt impressed
does not have good sound but hey
if youre just wanting a toy go for it
i doubt you can beat this for 25
the uke is a solid little guy
pretty well in tune up the neck
ive owned several multieffect pedals in the past even one digitech
then i saw this one
i decided to go cheap and got the rp255
so far that was an ok decision
i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation
these are mirrored by 60 userdefined profiles which are identical to the factory presets
the difference is that 160 can be modified by the user or left asis
the factory presets  61120 are not modifiable
the looper is really why i bought this pedal
its easy to use and it overdubs
i only wish digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper
20 seconds really isnt much
fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time
ok all thats good so why am i disappointed in this unit
im an older guy who has been playing for approximately 50 years
come on guys not all of your customers are 13 years old
i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices
now im faced with working out all of my own presets
im back to programming menus again ugh
for 120 you get virtually every effect in the book
delay and chorus are also pretty good
downloadable presets on the internetconsdistortions and overdrives are pretty meh
nothing as good as even a ds1 pedal
nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive
and nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive
no dice so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots
that makes what seems like a lot 60 slots get filled up pretty fast
in the end its definitely worth the 120 i spent on it
i recommend this if youre in the market for one
not the best pedal out there but for the price
the unit itself has held up well
no problems with case or pedals
all switches knobs plugs  display work fine
it doesnt have a onoff switch but thats minor
its low profile and is easy to switch by foot
i have it going into my mixer which works fine
no feedback or buzz from it
i like the recording software cubase that came with it
i didnt think id use it much but i do
its fun and easy to record my own songs
which if you dont have you need it
the drum presets are fun to use
isnt that what its all about
my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets
also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isnt
also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak
i dont like them at all
the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone
i use alot of the other ones as well
imho this the must have addition to your set up
its not for professional use
but when i turn pro ill get something better
the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun
i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential
bottom line  a great toy
lots of good presets and capabilities
works with downloadable xedit software
with the xedit you call up a canned sound and start changing it
the interface does not match the rp 255 and has a lot more provisions
the thing is they get to be a bit overwhelming at least to me
i got this for christmas and would shop around a lot more
perhaps i wind up choosing this but so far eh
i kinda demands output to another devicemixeramp if you want to play loud
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys
i didnt believe it myself
so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables
i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was misswired
now i will be checking all of them for sure
not a good start though
glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on
i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables
the testers are very cheap and may show problems you werent aware of
it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it
i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone
they appear to be very well built and sound just fine
i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly
highly recommended for the price
high quality and great sound
the coversion cable didnt work
t is  axlr to ubs cable
i have the red  blinking light syndrome also
so izm thanks hde for wasting my time
go sell your snake oil to someone else
i wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar
they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though
these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most
at least not with the mic boom there
heavy to travel with also so i dont know how much ill use it
the question was 34did it meet your expectations
34 and it certainly did
it is heavy duty but also light
it really seems well engineered and made of quality material
very secure effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe
i bought this stand after trying two others that didnt work well
this one is very adjustable and stays put
ill be buying two more
i use this for my ipad
i drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit
its solid and works great very adjustable
i am very happy with how it performs in both situations
high quality solid support and good design decisions all around
i will try to add pictures when i get a chance
note  the music stand easily detaches from the adjustableangle part for storage
this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations
this gig bag was just what i needed to carry around a soprano ukelele
this gig bag is well worth the price
it has a durable feel to it
great bag well padded the shoulder strap is nice
what you would come to expect from lanikai
it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews
it also has a nicely padded handle
i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well
they cost a little more than this
this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right
i like to ride my bike and take my uke along
the small size means it fits my panniers just fine
the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes
highly recommended for the adventurous uke player
the soprano one fits great even though its a different brand
this bag was nicer than i expected for the price
the case is better padded than i might have expected for the price
but this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls
for a soft bag this offers all i would ever need
its not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me
too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead
great mic for the price
ive used both the es57 and es58 for several years now
they are a fantastic mic great quality and construction
i love how hefty they are
ive got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed
i have several brands some more expensive but i always come back to gls
this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm57s
its quite a bit stronger of a microphone also
i am really impressed with this mic
same with the sm 58es58
i had to give it a shot
the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said
value for money it cant be beat
if you are on a budget get one
and the es57 is equal to the shure sm57 at 6000 less
quality is really outstanding for the price
sound is clear and crisp
so my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing
okay my pros and cons
my voice sounds great with this thing
with this my voice is strong and clear
im extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound
it is worlds better than usb mics like the blue snowball
its heft heavy and feels well made
this might be the most expensivefeeling device i own
its heavy but it in a good way
the materials feel high quality
this feels like a professional microphone
it comes with a mic stand holder thing
never say no to free stuff
youll need to buy an xlr cable on your own
its not bad enough to deduct a star
there are people who are comparing this to the shure sm57 and other microphones
heres the thing i am an amateur
so i am not the authority
all i can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing
so if youre looking for a vocalpodcast mic this is a great cheap option
sure but not for this price
i expected this shure sm57 knockoff to disappoint me
for 30 bucks this thing does the job
there is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about
i put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise
i recommend this mic for vocals
ive had fun with it
as far as longevity and durability time will tell
these mics are very solid and i cant tell them from the real deal
wish that it had a onoff switch but you can get around that
great for instruments and vocals as well
some may disagree but im convinced
is it as good as the shure
i dont know i think so  others may not
a nobrainer as far as i can tell
wow i will never buy another sm57 again
i cant believe im writing this but its ture
i am so psyched that i found this microphone its perfect
but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me
i continually look at it and cant believe i only paid 30 for it
sell your sm57s for 60 and turn them into two of these
this is a great value
i was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this
it doesnt sound exactly like an sm57 but it will get you close
you can eg your amp to compensate for the difference
this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm57
i appreciate its compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock
it performs as it should and appears to be quite durable
being able to angle the unit is great
mine lasted for a couple of weeks
it was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront
all in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly
works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch
easy to get that last bit of fine tuning
i could not be happier
once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner
it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on
a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark
easy to use accurate programmable lights up easy to read decent quality
i like it korg has never disappointed me
it fits well on my les paul and strat
does not fly off the head when playing
the light works really well and that was what i was looking for
as far as accuracy its right on in either setting
the two violins we ordered came on time and were packaged very well
all pieces that were advertised were included
the items appear as pictured
lolwould allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice
i wouldnt say its agreat instrument but way more than i expected for 60
i bought anew bow for 62100 so
and found i like the one that came with it at least as much
ill prob use it with my upgrade
so for the price you really get far more than you pay for
the shoulder rest is kinda useless though
sounds decent and stays in tune
run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer
windows 7 didnt need to install any driversit was plug n play
reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record
i found that others had the same issue
so far the behringer uca 222 is working great
this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget
there is pretty much little to no latency and it isnt noticeable
uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter
its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to dawdat interface
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs
this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones
i used this with my samson mixer
is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough
the red color looks nice
has a headphone out with volume control plug and play
theres no audio interface this affordable
441 khz and 16 bit sampling
should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz
even my digitech rp255 has a built in 24bit audio interface
anyway two thumbs way up for the uca222
this unit is quiet and very handy
the price is dead cheap
some of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic
one reviewer wrote that it is a very lowlow
that couldnt be further from the truth
from the audacity web site
for such a low price you cant go wrong
i just needed this for my new guitar
from the looks of it it complements the instrument well
i am happy with it
its performance is minmax the same
ive used three with no trouble
you can get excellent instructions and tips on youtube
the buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install
check out this rather entertaining howto video to see the installation process
for these particular buttons i used a 18 drill bit for the pilot holes
snug fit but imo not too tight
easy to install these buttons on the guitar
well made and just what i was looking for
fender original parts cant be beat
used them while building a few prewired pick guards
they work and are fender parts
even thoigh they work on many brands
use them on all makes and no complaints todate
theyre shiny and screwed well into the holes
the sound is a little too electronic for me
i bought an rp1 and it sounds much better
this little unit is packed with great effects
for 50 im very impressed
these types of pedals are toys
they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with
works well and has good sound
i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds
i had a friend with one of these and he loves it
it did work for awhile
i would not advise anybody to get this
great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar
it does what it is designed for
cant beat these 10 stands
but once open they stand up well
sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price
you will pay up to 4x more for similar stands
this is a quality stand
i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great
nothing but praise for this item
this particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar
small yet sturdy enough to hold a fullsize guitar
a very good price for an excellent product
item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed
i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house
this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand
i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it
i should have bought another one of these instead
i highly recommend this guitar stand
for the price and free shipping this cant be beat
its heavy weight solid construction and very stable
pay attention to the warnings
if your guitar has polypropylene finish which most do youre going to be fine
if you have a very high end guitar this might not work
this holds guitars very well
i wish it was made in america
it works perfectly and my recording are rich and full
my studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs
but for speakers or other static applications theyre just fine
noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price
i used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems
give good crisp and live sound to my acoustic guitar
it is affordable and the material is solid enough that it can withstand abuse
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day
these have been ordered for a couple of weeks
you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks
i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day
hope they work when they do finally arrive
this was for a friend who needed a guitar capo
he hasnt had any problem with the capo yet
and the price was right
this is a really strong capo
the spring is very robust
well padded and will not damage your instrument
i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin
takes some hand strength to open it but you dont want a weak capo
very pleased with timely arrival of the package
the plastic tension section just snapped off
i just got it today
really tight because its brand new but its really sturdy and solid
nothing gimmicky or faulty just perfect
you have to get this cap on just right or the strings will buzz
for it being pretty cheap i had to get it
shipping was fairly fast and its ready to use straight out of the package
its not the ole clip it and go capo im used to
were not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitar
my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one thats easy
for the money it does the job ok
its a good one for beginers like myself
it does not break and is very sturdy
i was skeptical because of the price but these work great
it is even large enough to use with my 12 string
this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open
im hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension
it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar
i cannot do it with one hand
my first concern was will this damage my guitar
it is user friendly and guitar friendly
the price is so low you should own at least one
at the most competitive price available
i received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar
it is made of aluminum not abs plastic as another reviewer suggested
sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo
i rate it at 5 stars
its well worth the money
i may play around with it to see what all it does
good price just as described
capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary
strong spring that good start
if needed i would buy another
for me and my son it works great
like the black and it holds well
no problem as i bought one as a spare against emergency breakage
this was a cheap capo but it does its job well
i have no complaints about it at all
the item came quickly and as decribed
or are you know how to use capo
im more than 20 years of playing guitar
this capo is worth the price
good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts
best recomended quality and price
may not for very big guitar neck
it is an excellent backup capo
i dont feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job
i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings
i got two of them
id recommend it over more expensive capos any day
very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime
easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight
cannot go wrong with this one
this is a great stand
this one serves the bill
i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable
i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased
the music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion
i added a clip on led light as well
strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job
may buy another for a spare
i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar
solid yes adjusts to right height  yesit is perfect
product is a solid build and prices right
knobs work well and the stand doesnt slip
legs hold up pretty well also
assembled the stand in seconds
it is very stable and solidly constructed
very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows
dont hope to take chords on it
only on first 4 strings may be
i had a similar amp before that died
i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume
if you try playing clean with no distortion youll be underpowered
the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation
for the price its good
its quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag
i was rather skeptical of this little box amp but it works great
my acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments
well worth the money spent
one less thing to tote
i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks
i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap
our buy two more of these they are only 20 bucks
i like it as the stars say
when you turn it back on it usally works fine
some other people have made the same discovery also
i just glued it to my pelvis
the sound quality is surprisingly hot
this portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone
at 2000 this amp is a deal
a cute little monster thats surprisingly loud and versatile
i bought primarily for travel and im pleased with my purchase
the amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings fuzz twang etc
i also purchased the ac adaptor since these things typically eat batteries
this is the best amp in this category
i know people who have the marshall and the fender
they were both amazed with the sound
they said well mine was only 45 and mine was only 40
too bad so sad for them
i told them mine was 20
the honeytone is aptly named
it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size
the tone range is generous from mellow to high treble
it tends to go distortion to the point of garble
ive bought three of these now and plan to buy more
ok im surprised that this unit is now over 1500
i only spent 859 for this and im mad at myself
it feels solid looks like a real direct box
sorry folks but id skip this one
the 5star ratings must be from employees
keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine
i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one
so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution
the pdc21 is a nofrills device
it does a fine job
thats to be expected in a passive di box and it doesnt bother me
im using it with an lr baggs m1a active soundhole pickup
it does everything i wanted and the price was right
i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one
some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation
with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly
this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops
this product worked very well for my needs
works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes
i bought 4 pcs of these at 8each shipped
these are very well constructed and function very well too
i would definately buy more
it stopped working after 2 gigs
im not sure why but it is very frustrating
i guess you get what you pay for here
grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year
i got three single channels and two dual channel units
crystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console
not one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup
always getting the question34can i hook my keyboard into your sound board34
cant say much more than the description
its a cheap box that works
nothing fancy and not for everyone
if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
ive bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet
ill definitely buy more and highly recommend them
just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper asian made
tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available
these are basically the same as schaller strap locks
they cost less money and i think the parts are interchangeable
it is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer disclaimer
based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these
arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised
would buy these again ifwhen i acquire new guitars
actually theyre not fender they are schaller but that is really good
looks great in my fender squier
got a vintage instrument you dont ever want to see hitting the floor
well here are is the long term 100 secure solution
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
we tried to make the fendershallers work but just could not
easy to use and very secure
there is a lot to think about with a strap lock
does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar
the fenderschaller design covers all of these bases well
i believe it is 100 sturdy and reliable
it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many
ive switched over to this design and couldnt be happier with it
if you have a padded leather strap i dont recommend these
this is a very good strap lock system
i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap
this was a filler item for a much larger order
i sincerely like the concept
easy to install i used the guitars existing strap button screws
straplocks came with black  white felt thats a nice touch
i think black looks better with my guitar
qualitywise it feels a bit cheapish
you gotta bend over and flip those
i dont care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks
thats not pedal board friendly in my opinion
nice as a tabletop effect
the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 775 x 65 approx
the standard 9v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun
this is not a bad way to get started playing with that
you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank
your situation might be different than mine
not a bad product acceptable at its price point just didnt impress me much
there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psusb
otherwise the time machine works fine as described
i really like this delay
its simple and works well
i really am starting to love behringer
great pedal for a great price
this is an awesome analog echo effect
very similar to a ehx memory man it does it all
other than that for the price its just awesome
however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one
there really is no midi support
im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back
youll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes
keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lintfree cloths
for the money it costs it worth it
really should be 1434 mono or stereo
ill try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said
setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic
and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box
at first glance the different tone kits dont bring much to the table
it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal
in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box
but its still fun to use
and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare
ive had this set for about a month and a half
so far it is working well for me
but it is still an error in functionality
i agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup
it has a very natural sound is reliable and amazingly strong
i doubt that the 200 stuff is much better
got it right b4 xmas thanks amazon
it is one of the best value i have purchased
great value and quality for 11 i spent ever
i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar
he said that you can hear the guitar but barely
it does not stick on to the guitar very well
the suction cup does not work
its very hard with room temp 70f
it picks up sound ok but not great
i bought this to try out on my baritone uke
it works great and is very easy to use
i use it with my fender mustang
i wet it before attaching
you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc
it could be used on just about any instrument
some may need a clamp
it picks up anything it is attached to
it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp
i bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles i own
the first ukelele was a lanakai lu21
straight into a guitar amp it gave plenty of volume
a peghole reamer might have done a better job but i didnt have one
the purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2
this sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which i installed the pickup
i would buy another if i needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument
it is simple practical and cheap
there are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that
you dont buy 15000 pickup for a 200300 instrument
also some roomspashosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument
i will experiment with different instruments  write more about the quality later
that said there is only one piezo element unlike a kk pickup for example
that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words
simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear
youll never get your arm in there far enough
lolyou will need a 1532nd drill bit to complete the install
found a sweet spot near area 34234 on the weak instructions
terrific bargain for the price
so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar
sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa
this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes
but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume
the pickup is very over sensitive
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic
should of just forked over the money for an ae
i have a yamaha f335 i really like
i first picked up a transducer for about 3 and experimented
overall product quality is good
sound in my opinion needs some tweaking
ive used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces
the fact that it is passive really kills it
i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements
i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it
not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar
i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself
jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable
this is a hitormiss product
for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well
it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on
the taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should
i bought this strap for my taylor guitar
its a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft
the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted
nice to see something well made for a change
taylor logo makes it look good and official
nothing bad to say about this strap
they were twice as loud as these
they dont do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do
the cons definitely outweigh the pros here
especially on the low end
theyre dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound
the highs are very tinny
almost sounds like a bad recording
your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings
this is especially true for the g string
grip is the last thing you want on your strings
there are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings
that is they may sound soft and cheap
i would not put them on most martin dreadnoughts for example
but they may work fine on lightly braced guitars
the only way to find out for sure is to experiment
the sound is a bit brighter
my music partner says she prefers the way these silkandphosphor blend with her fiddle
this is so out there that i wont let it influence my rating
my guitarbanjos tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass
i ended up using a daddario string of the same gauge in its place
whats not to love about these strings
they ring like they should
but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long
these sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report
had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing
i didnt expect them to  but a guy can dream cant he
it also helped with the rather high action
they play and sound softer
its almost like having a new guitar
thats how much of a difference these strings make
if youre really an acoustic guitar aficionado youll want to try these
the almost play themselves imo
and that makes me want to play twice as long
but then again i didnt have to buy these
they are fun and kitschy
this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan
i bought him two different types he he liked them both
these will not be used much
i just got these to collect not to use to play with
they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff
they arent that expensive especially as an addon and theyre relly cool
id say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection
i dont use them all too often because theyre a bit too stiff though
for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product
even the packaging it cool
excellent product from a fantastic seller
this is my first noise reducer
it works and like it says it reduces the noise
it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch
i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer 6pedal board
most of the b pedals work quite well
i have no quality issues with them
some are better than others and this one works perfectly
then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick
the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust
i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not
it was a great choice
the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesnt alter your tone
it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden
i have 4 of these so far will get more if needed
behringer all the way you can keep your expensive boss pedals
i think this is my fifth behringer pedal
admittedly i havent had the time to try this one out
when it comes to noise gates this definitely does the trick
plus behringer is the best brand for pedals
it does the job as described it though
i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me
this is a nice little pedal
it effectively quiets all my other pedals
not much else to say
contrary to the name it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer
this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price
does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack
ive used this live since i got it and it works great no problems
its made of plastic but that doesnt effect anything its pretty tough
great value and a great tool
seems like a nice pedal
has some nice rubber on the bottom
they work fine for me
my pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now
if youre doing something similar to me im sure you will be too
the foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals
i am very impressed with this unit
nothing is lacking to start playing right away
i am not disappointed in the least
i think you will like this board
the pics and description dont show just how insanely large this is
this is a very good investment
it works amazing and saves plenty of time
the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing
this item is very convienent
this board does the job for at least 6 pedals
it should just take some getting used too
one concern is that the linked power cables dont have anyplace to disappear into
i will be working on this
the only way to shut off the power is to unplug it
i wish it had a power switch
but i like them a lot
i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably
this is a good purchase
not so much for a guy
i expect the pick to wear down from use
these are fine but didnt fit well but they are a quality product
in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight
ive used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars
the major problem with these is they arent large
theyre like most other brands medium
my thumbs arent tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average
dont buy these if you have a large thumb
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all
i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly
it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit
any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can
they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time
they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
and yes i double checked the packaging to ensure i was shipped large
the national mediums i was using before had a looser fit boggle
all in all 4 stars
hate to see how the mediums fit
first off the amp shipped with bad tubes
microphonicnot a big deal it happens all the time
they are clueless arrogant and condescending
i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point
this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugerabehringer product
now about the amp itself
it has no headroom even on the 5w setting
i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing
it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it
you will only get a muddy garbled mess
clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there
think of marshall cleans or even vox
the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from
its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more
the classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp
but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low
i should start by saying that i did not buy this from amazon
its very cool that it has 5w 1w and
i havent seen that in any amp in this price range
the 1w setting is perfect for my studio and the
1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack
the 5w setting can really crank out the volume
thats another amp i was considering
and the vox is 4w while the bugera boasts 5w
the digital reverb has a spacious feel
i love reverb and wouldnt buy an amp without it
all in all im very pleased
i also tried the bugera v22 all tube amp at the same guitar center
but thats way too much amp for me at this time
and drive another speaker cabinet which bugera also makes
the seem to be all the same company
this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound
arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger
use a shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing
recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue
this amp really surprized me
its made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great
there is a headphone jack which is why i bought it
i would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal
gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether
but over all this amp is a most welcome deal
no transistor amp i own sounds as good
this is a great little amp especially for the money
how does it sound you ask
i dont own a strat so i cant comment on single coils through it
if you want to play metal youre going to need a distortionoverdrive pedal
i havent swapped tubes or the speaker  its completely stock
its an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type
i was able to get great marshall like tone out of it quite easily
id give this baby six stars if i could
the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp
ive run my strat tele and taylor t5 through this
i was really surprised by this
this amp would sell for double the price tag
once i read about the bugera b5 i knew i wanted one
only five watts yes but thats still enough to fill a room
a small but effective little amp
amazing lowend output for such a small cab
of course its not too loud  thats the whole point
this is a highly featurefull amp at this price point
i can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones
like most line 6 products some features are not highly apparent
on the metal channels it really drives the gain over the top
the tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are ok
and it really works well for home practice situations
it has a great tone balance to my ears
it has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesnt
overall i recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp
i personally guarantee your satisfaction
no seriously are you buying it
never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear
never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker
just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices
light weight easy to carry
solid nice sound very good quality to make anyone happy except your neighbors
now after a couple of months i want to say
better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen
i wrote to line6 and i got useless answers about
i wish i had found this amp sooner
the first thing i did was went through all the presets
you can also do this with all the other channels too
its a small amp but its bigger than i thought it would be
but the sound that comes out of that 834 speaker is big
i would buy this amp again if mine was stolen
makes a great practice room amp
for the price its a bargain
my only complaint is i didnt like the clean sounds not to my liking
other than that an awesome amp
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps
this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding
maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb
ive had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it
its choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me
the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other lessuseful effects
the auxillary jack is also a great addition
the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use
hundreds of sounds to choose from
tones bands specific songs sounds
twang to slayer in a flip of a preset
this amp is non stop fun
tons of sounds and it can be 100 edited to fit your demands
nice volume coming out of it also for 75 watts it seems more
ive been playing rock and blues for over 40 years
i also have a small peavy 50 watt solid state combo
out of the box i was amazed at just about everything
the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich
and the thing is loud
and then the less than good
it doesnt come with a foot switch
and  it doesnt come with any manuals to speak of
bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal
it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd
virtually every genre is represented here
i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it
something else that weighed into my purchase was durability
although i only play for fun i still play 23 hours a day
they sound better more prefessional
they are all better than the line6 every one of them
to get those flawless professional sounds
i had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing
ultimately my search was narrowed down to this spider and a fender mustang
regarding the sound it is unbelievable
and to be quite honest ive only been using the presets
the cleans are ultra clear and the rock tones are amazing
and this thing is loud
with live play this could hold its own and in the sweet spot
i feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones
i thought they were all great
they are getting very very close to tube sound
loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone
the pitch shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun
and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard
says so right in the manual
no there is still a little digital overlay around in there
this little amp packs tons of tone  sound
hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully
75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off
lots of bang for the buck here
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
i own several tube amp combo and halfstack
the line 6 spider iv 75watt combo was the perfect solution
up to this point i havent been very impressed by solidstate technology
not so with the spider iv
ive been extremely impressed with all the different amp models
id describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge
the tone has continually improved as ive broken in the speaker
just in conclusion theres basically nothing this amp cant do at least fairly well
channel switching is a breeze with almost no delay
its good but doesnt really cut it if you want a great wah sound
overall though its a good buy for your line 6 amp
provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volumewah pedal that works great
you can plug it into the pc and customize everything
self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp a real nice feature
one less power supply to hook up
foot switches are easy to use
built in tuner works great
first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express
read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal
there is no need to dl the fbv software for this
this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv
b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal
31014 edit  looper control is flawed
you can stop from overdub but not start the loop
nope you cantd tap tempo
this feature alone makes it a musthave for taking full advantage of the amp
the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volumewah 2in1 pedal
i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal
the tuner works amazing as well
this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but its gone now
i think the product should have been around 7080
i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome
it was easy to install and the finish was perfect
i am proud to have this product
fits my fender well looks amazing
great quality in it also
been golding up an 88 strat plus that has seen better days
this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance
the goods are up to scratch and fit properly
good service product packing and delivery time
color is good and as pictured and it doesnt seem to scratch easily
only thing that was slightly upsetting is that i only received one screw
they shorted me a gold screw
luckily i had extra and this didnt bother me that much
not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs
cheap to buy but cheaply made
no problems with seller and product came quick
i wasnt expecting much from the mic
i mean cmon what can you expect for that price
this is a really nice microphone
it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price
i would buy this again
im surprised that the maker of amazons popular at2020 would go this low
the mic imo is fullyvalued even at its singledigit price
its very lightweight and with its optional plug and onoff switch is versatile enough
the quality of the sound moreover isnt badproviding you can hear it
i havent tested it for recording purposes
despite appearances this mic is no bargain
it comes with 2 aaa batteries
i remembered 34eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie34 and just tuned away
it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments
money very well spent and highly recommended
i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings
i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard
could not be any happier
at ten dollars i think its a nobrainer
he says its easy to use and is durable
it has led lights to follow as well as a meter to use
in the beginning i had problems
after several days i felt much better about it
im pretty new to this so i take the blame
buy it you will never regret
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage
the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes
i just recently started up learning guitar
i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes
easy to use and perfect size
cheap accurate over mic even better over jack
well i just got started playing guitar and needed a tuner
so i used the builtin microphone to tune my guitar
one of the best  accurate tuners that i have ever used
fits in most guitar cases  is lightweight
a good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks
this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio
if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it
within 5 minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect
i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical
i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on
i have never heard my guitar sound so good
i am super impressed with this little thing
if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get
i use it to cradle my electric guitar it works beautifully
i have at least 5 of these
i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport
i bought the first about 10 years ago
it is still like new
found the guardian at amazon and thought for 10 how could i go wrong
i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support
wanted one again so found this one and bought it
maybe its a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric
i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these
the price is great and it works
simply the best picks ever for bass
recommended by eric friedman on a post and im glad i followed the recommendation
they last a long long time and are surprisingly easy to grip
i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite
both are going to be used for years
these pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material
in fact i found it increases speed
these are perfect for a fastpaced style of picking
the tone is bright and snappy
good quality material ensures i wont be needing another set for a long time
i am still searching for the worlds perfect allpurpose pick
nice pics that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
the screen is big and easily read
its so much better than my korg ca1
the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel
i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch
the tuning is accurate the lcd screen is clearly visible it works great
im not sure about battery life i havent gotten there yet
so it easy to quickly tune up
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money
but all in all works well
good display and very easy to use
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isnt very friendly
snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down
it works fine but its inconvenient
i dont use any of the other features
i also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument
not my first intellitouch tuner
overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
this pad is great for midi vstis drums queuing and its got great action
the software is a little lame and doesnt always work properly
but you dont really need it that much anyways
my cpu is windows 7 but it worked on my msi netbook also
this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online
i own a native instruments maschine mikro
but find myself using this even more often
you can program it to whatever midi values you want
the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive
i share most of the same sentiments
i love the pads and the knobs
i used it with live 8
powered usb hub in between
i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply
so it may not work in some configurations
it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem
if yours has this problem send it back while its still in warranty
at least for a few weeks
technical support is also almost zero
customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this
try finding a midi tutorial that is usable
good luck with that chore
added 08nov2010  the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing
this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad
its not loaded with gimmicksjust the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed
the keys are 85 of standard width which is large enough for fumblefree playing
its lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory
but it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultraportable
its regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard
its nothing of the sort nor should it be
i was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own
im elated to know i can now get these buttons separately
no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use
after testing a set i have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars
these are allparts parts quick usps shipping
it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too
the rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo
it only cost around 60 so perfection should not be expected
for practice and the home studio it is great
5 starts totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal
as usual an excellent zoom product
not too difficult to get the hang of
there is so much in this little box
i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar
it is my first pedal of any sort
it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with
i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade
this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didnt
comfortable and very nice fabric
looks awesome with my white jackson
great strap for the price
absolutely no complaintsissues at all
it does the job but it is a little low on the quality side
it works and i feel comfortable with it supporting my axe
but dont let that deter you
that just means it will breakin that much more quickly
its a classic strap from fender
what else is there to say
very beatiful and good quality
nothing bad to say its a fender strap with the hard rock leather look
very nice quality of leather
its just a little bit short for my taste
the guitar rested too high for my liking
i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine
good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china
i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles
great seller and fast delivery
thanks amazon for a great product
looks good and has the fender logo prominent
i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it
this is a nice strap
i like the black side and the soft leather side
there are a few issues however
the mic holder has the same issue
it is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera
i would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication
its great for a desk or a small recording studio
perfect for my obscure use
now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post
what to do with it
i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights
its always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place
promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure57 stays in one place
but otherwise a wise and good purchase
this is what it shows a simple small mic stand that dont fall over
good for table top cajon hole by floor or recording
its well made and works well
i have no complaints about it
this is a good item and has served me well
easy to use and accurate
only issue in tuning drop d or b on a 5  string bass
it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it
it tends to fall off quickly on low notes
microphone works well for acoustic guitars
thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine
however this worked fine as a plain tuner
i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house
this is a nice tuner that works great
nice part is it works on all stringed instrument
this is the tuner you want
ive got a couple of these and for the most part im very satisfied
on the mandy absolutely no problems
on guitars it sometimes doesnt register on the low e usually moving around helps
i already owned two of these tuners previously  purchased these for friends
they are great for jamming with friends  are so user friendly  accurate
i love mine  so do my friends
in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat
i have two of them
just clip it on about the nut and tune away
pickers playing next to me dont interfere with me tuning
i have owned just about every tuner made
they all had pluses and minuses
i like this one a lot
it is my tuner of choice right now
the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate
it is also small which i appreciate
for this price 15 you simply cant go wrong
this neat little tuner has it all
it is cheap to buy at amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning
i keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times
there is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it
it was only about 15 at amazon and worth many times that amount
this thing is a little jewel
this little tuner does the job
ever since then no buzz
at this price why not
this is a great little item
runs on one cr 2032 pancake batteryincluded
5 stars all the way
i have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench
they have been very dependable and easy on batteries
this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished
i is accurate just doesnt respond to the string a fast
this little tuner is very precise
its fast and easy to use
i got two of them
works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument
the intelli imt500the tuner that killed the intellitouch
there are scores of chromatic tuners on the market
most work by using a small builtin microphone that picks up sound waves
in order to be used effectively the tuning space must be relatively quiet
a bunch of years ago a variety of cliponmicrophones began to be marketed
now anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise
then the intellitouch tuner hit the market
the entire tuner clipped onto the instrument
one could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment
jams and festivals bluegrass folk whatever became seas of intellitouch tuners
in particular they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars
the more overtones an instrument produces the worse the tuner behaves
so it was very much a lovehate relationship
the shortcomings were huge but the convenience meant that they were tolerated
it was an intellitouch that worked if not perfectly then a whole lot better
the amazing thing is that the switch from intellitouch to intelli wasnt gradual
within six months of its introduction jams and festivals became seas of intelli tuners
thats a considerable investment to abandon
and it works darn well in a quiet environment too
i only have used this tuner on classical guitars the ones with nylon strings
it has tuned them all very well
pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2
ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3
swivel head for ease of viewing the screen
the screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight
rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7
clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers
being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning eadgbe
its tuning range is 12 note
will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of nonuse
delay on tuning low e string2
buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string b3
i will update this review when i have that information
but for now i am very pleased with this tuner
i have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all
great chromatic tuner at a great price  i love it
this is the second tuner i have bought like this
i got it because i need a second tuner
they are very good tuners and i highly recomend any tuners this company makes
the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch
it also appears that the tuner wasnt reliable on the pitch end either
this tuner works for sure but i dont think its the best out there
the snark is cheaper too
so i gave this to him to save some time
i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china
its very rare thing to see now a days
this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused
if you wanted to tune and didnt have a 14 input good luck
bought this rosin to see how i would like it
jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow
it hardly generates any dust and gives the bow that extra grab
the only problem is that the effect wears off quickly
i use it in combination with motrya gold
what can you say about rosin
i have tried several rosins for my violin
of all of them i especially like lopera jade
it leaves very little rosin dust on the violin
yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for
very good rosin and does exactly what is described
a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows
very nice product and fits well and good quality
its held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone
when playing an electric 34bodyless34 violin that hurts the collar bone
you must have one of these
it changed the whole way i play now
it is not too tight nor too loose
it is very well made
this shoulder rest is very comfortable and really helps get the right playing angle
this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle
good value for the price
this does work as described
it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out
its quite hard on your collarbone
it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time
i didnt use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable
but is a well made product if you use it for what its for
i am extremely happy with this product
the padding is also excellent and comfortable
also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me
which is not expected at this price point
the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go
what about the eh metal muff
i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away
the big 34selling point34 about the mm is that it has a top boost
what about the boss me70
that at some point the tradeoff does indeed make sense
fyi  dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp1101 as part of his live rig
the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins
check out the ada gcs3 if you can
anyway through the gcs3 the fullbore basically sounds like a mesaboogie
hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines
i dont mess with the noise gate so i cant really comment on that
good tone but dicey controls
best distortion i ever used
having the built in gate is also nice and it works
the muff is a lot more noisy
but i like em both
i just use them for different tones
i use to use my sound card
you can just plug in your guitar or bass
just today i got the new tascam us100 usb audio interface
it of course uses the windows audio drivers
tried all sorts of things oh brother
it still would not install
but to my luck i found out what the problem was
thank god for the website that had this on a blog
in the c windowsinf folder there must exist two files wdmausb
inf file that is important
some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdmausbinf
baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names
and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us 100 worked
its easy to rename the files you just open wdmausbinf
bak and  then save them as wdmausb
anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this
im happy with the tascam us 100
i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer
and it did the same with a usb phone
its built like a tank and its nice and solid
this interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint
spend some more money if you want something good
there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i dont blame the device
it uses stock os drivers that loaded right up
once configured however its been solid
if i plug the us100 back in the settings revert again  very reliable
this is where the balance control is very helpful
very simple to use for overdubbing
while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and visversa
again the us100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities
you cant rely on the product description or packaging to answer that
plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus
the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo
it works as a beginner tool but only that
this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it
im using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick
if not for the hum it would get 5 stars
unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem
if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise
sent it back after one day
well i dont really know what else to say
the picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order
they work well after adjusting them to fit
have been using these for years now
there is no doubt about it national fingerpicks are pretty much the standard
the metal fingerpicks are rock solid sturdygauge steel
the plastic thumbpicks match tone very well
and note that unlike what you may read in another review they are adjustable
on my resonator these provide a full loud sound
they are solid sound great and this packaging of them is excellent
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it
they really help me out and they are a cheap price
just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned
with priceassortment in mind i give 5 stars
i brought this for my husband drum set
it is made very nice
sticks are well organized and always in reach
this is a musthave item for drummers and the wellorganized
it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical
practical useful for drum kit
tilts to match personal requirement
fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances
brass tacks  is this the greatest mic in the world
but on a budget this mic is amazing
the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out
if you are looking for s nice rich sound this is it
i compared this to a c1 which is pretty good for half the price
i also tried two mxls
this is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much
i noticed the difference on guitar
on vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you
besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me
i tried the cad m179
that did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids
and its more than the switches difference which i dont use anyway
i didnt like the switches on the cad m179 either
its confusing and i do gain or filter in my daw
at the end im satisfied with the 2035
for me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same
my challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room
ridiculous setup but ive save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that
for most vocals recording i dont use the closet
just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise
nice solid construction and vibration mount included
its rugged and i like it
the best deal for recording beginners
this mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instruments
its definitely flat and natural sounding which i like
i write and record my own music
i use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar
crystal clear and it doesnt color the recordings
it will pick up ambient noise from the front but thats to be expected
it does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back
be sure to get a pop filter to go with it
can be quite sibilance prone so beware
ehso for the pricehighly recommended
stick to known brandslike shure ev at etc
then come the newbiesa few models from mxl etc etc
sounds like a million bucks
it is my first condenser mic and at 149 it is a steal
ive always used shure or heil mics that cost over 250
this mic in a studio application smokes them
it is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it
but if you really want to be amazed do an ab comparison
this mic has convinced me to  purchase the audiotechnica  at4040
cant wait to get it and i will review it also
good value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount
all in all a good deal
i must say in the beginning i was not thrilled with the product
i normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal
ive been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far
it does the job perfectly
id buy this again for sure
a booster makes your signal louder
but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster
this pedal is really small in size has one knob  the footswitch
it does have an internal dip switch
you open up the back of the pedal  choose you own setting
this is one pedal that will stay on my board
it does one job only but it does it so well
indeed this little bluelighted wonder will make you famous
either way it gets you what you want
did i mention it has a blue light
a quality pedal that should hold up well
it just arrived to day and seems wellbuild
you really should try it yourself to understand
im using a fender jaguar this thing is married to it
im serious try it before you die
i bought this boost to use in one specific situation
yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster
i can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar
and oh my it records good
so you just record as quietly as you can
but oh boy i like it
a good buy well worth the price
now it doesnt worksame day i got it
if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment
this mic fits my studio need perfectly
its usb connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity
i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti
i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this
the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise
the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great
i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this
however recording a choir or something would work
but i will never do that and neither will you
this microphone only has a usb port
so no hope of expanding
this is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments
the nodelay headphone jack is great
setup was easy and quick
this may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventually
i am quite happy with the build quality
the base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly
the body and buttons are plastic but solid they dont feel or look cheap
definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it
makes this great and i mean great microphone even better
the yeti sounds as good
this microphone in just a few words is awesome
this was an excellent purchase
beside having a great range of audio pickup the mic is so versatile
and it sounds great too even better than their wellregarded snowball series
the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus
the yeti has it all in one package
yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this
trick  treat your room with sound deadening
blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product
its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility
then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub
plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action
my hunch is that a good powered 4port hub would be equally effective
this is the best usb microphone out for under 100 bucks
i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording
the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go
you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows 7
just check out my review video for the blue pop
this is a good quality microphone
its easy to set up
under windows 7 all i had to do is plug it in
also there is no driver supplied by the company
its just a matter of attention to detail
i unplugged the usb cable for the microphone and things went back to normal
repeating the process yielded identical results
after rebooting the computer the problem went away
hopefully there wont be long term issues
but those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself
to be honest i have no idea where this is coming from
that said for the price it is pretty good
i do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic
in case you were wondering this is a clone of the boss compressorsustainer
the box is plastic but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate
the knobs are solid and work just fine
you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box
i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio
it does what it is supposed to
my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic
no noticeable hum at 34concert34 level
yes this pedal is made of high strength plastic
if you are an angry stomper go elsewhere
this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot
yes its a pain in the butt
i bought a power supply never looked back
this should do well for you
the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow
the title says it all
great performance sub par construction
i bought this pedal for the compression and sustain though and am very pleased
i use it for both bass and guitar and it processes the signals well
i am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also
i removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit
wish it was better made
ive been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now
this pedal completed that task
its hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect
you cant go wrong with behringer pedals
theres not much to be said about this pedal  it just works
this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right
people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo
behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals
i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer
a bargain at the offered price
gives you virtually unlimited sustain
it is a good cheap addition to my effects board
what more can you ask for at roughly 2500
this is a very useful guitar compressor
it is a simple compressor thats it
easy to understand with responsive controls
i use compressors quite a lot
the behringer cs400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor
the behringer cs400 is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc9 i discuss below
behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc9
it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal
i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use
i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt30
i now know what i was missing all those years of not having one
behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass
i have an fcb10 that i use and like great controller for the price
is it equivalent to a boss dynacomp visual sound or keeley compressor
you will get 2000 worth of use out of it though for sure
the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita
good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point
behringer products are good for the semipro
doesnt sound good playing fast
my disappointment is with the sound
ive switched to using the builtin compressor in my digitech bp90 instead
and nice its like really just wow
but its really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise
the material is nicersofter than the original so that is a plus
the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it
yes one side in my test sounded better i felt
until i switched them around
wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe
notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc
brass tacks they are velour
they fit on the athm50 headphones
that is what i wanted
remember  because of the material you will notice a slight difference in sound
i got these because they were recommended replacements for the fostex t50rp
they fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads
for the price they are worth it
i dont own the srh840s but rather the srh440s
they are definitely more comfortable
i highly recommend this upgrade
i wanted an upgrade to my tu2 which i had for years
this tu3 is easier to see and is more precise in its tunings
i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic
as with all boss products ive been very happy
the tuner is easy to use
so in a way this is the most important pedal you can have
the design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid
i definitely recommend this pedal
i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together theyre fail safe
the title pretty much says it all
this is such a simple great tuner
the streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical
i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable
accurate and quick  great for between song quick tuning
its a boss pedal  so it is rugged and reliable
great product  well made  worth every penny
fantastic product that every guitar player needs  period
edit 10232012i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board
these really are the best tuners out there  you should get one today
i really enjoyed this tuner extremely fast an accurate at tracking you
its a great tuner a little pricy but worth it in the long run
i was even surprised they included a battery
it works and it works well
it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc
no damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings
if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have
my only minor gripe is that it is springloaded to open
thankfully i dont change strings too often
a musthave for your guitarbassukulele bag
its extremely wellbuilt and performs its task very well
overall this is an extremely wellmade tool for your guitar kit
this cuts strings with no problems
highly recommended for frequent string changes
handel is very comfortable too
anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool
it is easy to hold and is a good product
i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this
yes there many banjos and some with more frills
i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely
i see no flaws on my banjo
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would
i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy
i looked to make sure it wasnt warped or cracked and it wasnt
no worries though now im learning my new favorite instrument
my banjo arrived a couple days after i ordered it
it tuned up very easily and for me it holds tune nicely
it has a good ring to it
34quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations
great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price
sounds good and the action is smooth
the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine
recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money
the package was really well don e and arrived in good time
great value good quality and sound
very pleased with this purchase
high value for low  risk
you will not be disappointed
i bought this not knowing what to expect
it sounds just like i hear on tv and it sounds great
theyre not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience
at least they wouldnt be able to put together a quality banjo
but jameson guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price
the tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great
its also very good looking
i love the neck and the back
quality work was put into this thing
now i just need to get used to playing with 5 strings
i have been online shopping banjos quite
additionally mine came very well setup from the seller aside from the inevitable tuning
i would also deeply recommendsnark sn2 all instrument clipon chromatic tuner
this pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly
it was a good purchase
best 90 i have ever spend
i still own at least of each
anyway i have had this tuner for a few years now
stock this tuner was awful
however that was before a firmware update
after applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable
so now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works
so i have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars
without the update this tuner was borderline terrible
this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode
the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze
i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze
its totally silent very bright display sensitive meter
not that i ever use it
id buy this product again if i had it to do over again
this is a great little tuner for guitar
wow im really impressed with this tuner
its quick its accurate and it just works
you can tune all strings in same time
its halpfull in stage because you dont need to test each string individually
i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting
i dislike it so much i had to edit my review
i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat
all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning
it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning
i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner
i havent used the battery pack so dont know about battery life
i use a onespot plug to power it
its very heavy and seems sturdy and well built
being a studio owner i didnt buy this for stage work
i dont know about the
i was shocked by how well it works
i ordered a pitch black for 70
im still waiting on the return for this
i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery
my primary instrument is electric bass
but first some details about the tuner
its construction is extremely solid and its heft gives it stability
when you place it on a surface top of your amp floor your knee
secondly the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions
so that meant my inexpensive tuner wasnt nearly discriminating enough
this strobe tuner is cable input only
my only complaint with this device is the battery connector
i hate them as a rule
if youre accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it
every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support
so far no problems at all
it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it
first impression of profx8 is very good
but on this profx8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up
knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm
really like the eq on the main output
as well as mute on every channel
microphone preamp is soso i guess
but it does the function perfectly
runs a little bit on the hot side
i could not be happier
excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised
the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful
i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since
the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore
it works very well and is very sturdy
i use it for a hot rod deluxe
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand
the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing
sent it back and did not reorder
the other hardware isnt much better
cheap stuff a budget brand trying to pass as a name brand
great idea though and the price is right at 25 street
hopefully a better make will put out something more roadworthy
i dont even have to play the guitar anymore it does it for me
kidding aside this thing is really nice
this may not be so great for smaller amps
i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it
i play guitar and stand behind the vocalists
whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa
to your guitar amp or from it
and even play your mp3 player while you play and sing
if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it
link to a bass amp or subwoofer and you definitely have full sound
i know its a copy of other speakeramps
i think its a wonderful and adequate musthave for any musician
i like this speaker system behringer makes good products when it comes to this
you can connect an ipod or laptop to it
and there are multiple sound options including phantom and instrument
the price was great and the wattage was nice
the sound is great the wattage is good everything is wonderful
highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar
it sounds awesome and is built like a tank
does everything i want in a personal stage monitor
i like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack
i go around to different venues and sing
i just started in april after taking vocals for a year
i love it so much ive purchased this and my  own shure mic
b205d is a powerful speaker system
i needed something with eq on it as well
you really cant go wrong with this pamonitor
im not sure if this is normal or not
you see i purchased an open box speaker
hope this helps with your decision
behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most
i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack
so much more efficient than a floor monitor
hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space
light weight and very portable
i play 12 nights a week in a midiassisted duo
the behringer monitors do the job well
obviously behringer cloned the mackies and did a good job
in the end the real difference was the price
the behringers go for 15000 while the mackies go for about 25000
save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand
other than that these are great monitors
i just got the 3rd monitor
got here in 2 days
my first 2 units have a very bright blue ish color led for power
the latest one has a very mellow amber color led
anyone else noticed different color leds
weight and sound is the same
i use them for everything from full band to acoustic
great for vocals and guitar
mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat
these are made solid and are very stable
i knocked it to 4 stars because they dont match up
i have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them
they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise
both stands showed up in good and working condition
great speaker stands well constructed easy adjustments for different setups
recieved set of two stands with case promptly and in perfect condition
both arrived together and at the expected delivery date
personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103
the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs
there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing
after testing each of the tripod stands
all seemed to function perfectly well
the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up
the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved
i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated
however the bag was ripped in 3 places
the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing
the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other
the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights
they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway
the bag is simple canvas
it probably wont protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack
however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional
these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems
theyre functional durable and can be setup within just a few seconds
its comfortable and you can wear it for hours
it looks good as while
i got it earlier then expected and i love it
i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro
this will work for just about everyone
but i prefer the walker williams brand
but these work fine easy to get strap locks on
will keep on the side for next guitar
nice soft flexible leather and very adjustable
i was using a nylon strap before i got this one
i can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder
over the past couple of months ive been replacing guitar straps
this one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap
and it would be but the holes are too tight
really a major chore to get over a strap button
i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap
otherwise this is a nice strap
its a little stiff and im sure it will soften up upon more use
i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long
when you need a nononsense leather strap that is not long consider this
hard to beat it as far as leather straps go
sure there should be nicerbetter product but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks
my frist guitar strap i like it alot
dose not cut in your shoulder or back
will get aother one for 2nd guitar
still for the price i had to give it four stars
adjustments are easy to make and the fitfeel is fine
no fancy designs but a great value for the price
if youre looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely
leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars
so for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather
it doesnt feel like quality leather to me
the construction is pretty basic
it is a very good value though
it does seem like it can deal with some wear and tear
good strap very comfortable and strong
i searched on amazon for a banjo strap and this came up
when i received the strap i realized it doesnt fit a banjo
its not the best strap in the world but its not bad
i gave it four stars for that reason
i think it would wear quickly with lots of use
i bought this strap because i thought the pattern was awesome
just the design man go planet waves
like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you
first of all this strap looks super cool
the hootenany style is sweeeet
i have this on a cream colored stratlike guitar and it looks great
all in all this is a great guitar strap
throw some strap locks on it and away you go
it works well for holding up a guitar and it looks good doing it
my kid is happy with this strap for his guitar
he especially likes the colors
sweet strap nice colors good quality
adjusts easily nice quality leather hookups
i like the unique pattern on this thing too
came in a timely manner what else is there to say
its finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head
this strap is pretty thin
very cool design and looks good on my tele
and all for 7 bucks w prime shipping
this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves
but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package
maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up
that is if it lasts that long
if comfort is not important to you then get this strap
the price cant be beat and will give your guitar that 70s look
if i would have paid 20 on this strap i would be furious
but at only 7 this strap is still a steal
the only downside is that its a bit rough on any loose skin
for 99 of situations these strap rocks
at this price how can you go wrong
works just fine thank you
bought another for my strat
this is a very comfortable strap
because it is cotton this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps
it fits the guitar perfect and is easy to adjust
well made and you cant beat the price
when i first felt this strap i smiled
this is so supple to the touch making playing with it a great experience
yet its durable enough even for the roughest of players
it is fully adjustable allowing for all body types
this is the first strap that ive bought in a long time
i have a planet waves strap with studs and i like it very much
its the only strap ive ever used
now i have it put away and im using this one
if yore looking for a new strap i highly recommend this one
you will not be disapointed by it
i got this strap just to try something different than a nylon
it is also very long longer than i thought
i almost feel like i wont even need strap locks its so good
all in all a perfect buy for the money
install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment
then choose comfortable straps that wont scratch your guitar like this one
i was pleasantly surprised to find it wellmade with a clean simple appearance
this one fits the bill
the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable
good strap at a good price
leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible
nylon has incredible strength but isnt very comfortable
in my humble opinion cotton twill is totally the way to go
its comfortable and adequately strong
this strap is sturdy and robust and its plain black
you cant go wrong here
schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap
you should buy those too theyre great
i have several for our electrics and acoustics
live up to expectations and is comfortable
i would definitely buy a few more of these
its a good quality strap and i have three of them
being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild
i cant let on what ive done to mine because
come on were artists so show off your creativity
this is a very serviceable strap at a great price
it is an ok strap
the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing
it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker
allinall its a good strap for the money which wasnt much
this is a nice leather strap not thick but very functional and nice looking
planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product
its soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat
should last a while with good care
at full price of 1699 it is a solid deal
any lower and it is a steal
most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for
this one appears to be an exception to that rule
oh and tight strap button holes
nice strap for the money
i ordered black but got brown
nice solid no frills guitar strap
i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot
this is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface
my plan worked and this is a good quality strap to do it on
and such a good price
good leather good build made to last  and age nicely
it feel like leather but i am not 100 it is true leather
however at 10 a piece i have to give it 5 stars
i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily
this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs
this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap
nice strap but a bit too stiff
might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying
well built and good adjustability
cant go wrong with this one
this is a very good general purpose strap
a little stiff but im hoping it will loosen up with use
this is a great guitar strap for the money
the strap is comfortable and adjustable
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all
what else could you want in a guitar strap
i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years
the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges
for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build
only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps
one the back side of the strap is not black
its a bluegrey color and i didnt realize that
i assumed incorrectly that both sides were black
two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes
all that said it is nice and some will love it
quality at the right price
looks like it will last
solid four stars despite me personal opinion
i dont like these too much
the back side will shed for a while before settling down
the leather is rather soft
ive purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable
this particular one is just ok
would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice
the material used is fine
this is too short for most adults that play guitar
to me this was a worthless purchase
easy to install strap locks
use on blue strat and looks great
the only solid white leather strap i could find that didnt have any ornamentation
it is of average quality but for the price i wasnt expecting much
it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg550xx
it isnt the softest strap
but the width makes it feel better till its 34brokenin34
good leather that should last a long time
i have very similer straps that have lasted 30 years
it is a single strip of leather with no padding
maybe it just needs to be broken in
compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well
i am about 59 and a trim 155 lbs
update 2011jul31  the strap is still rather stiff
i will probably pick up a white cotton strap
those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion
strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost
i will still use a strap lock
nice product i suggest it
i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around
i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster
the 34strat34 is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard
im very pleased with it
not much else you can say about it
i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and theyre just bad
i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these
perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart
good quality cable with a good price
most of my cables are from planet waves and ive never had an issue
it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy
they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board
however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible
the boss pedals however were hit or miss
i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard
they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables
there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range
it works very well on a pedalboard
that requires a cable longer than 6 or 1 foot
the 3 foot is perfect and it works great
planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff
good cords with a decent length
i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box
works great and no noise
the shielding on these planet waves cables are great
using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal
well made cable with bulletproof molded ts protection
the cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well
without a doubt a very sturdy cable
it does what it should
they work great theyre quiet and theyre cheap
what else can you ask for
i really like the soft flexible cable these have
they were perfect for my pedal board
you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board
planet waves does make good products
i dont like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes
with these flats the sound is gone
i absolutely love these strings
im used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly
the strings are with out a doubt real fender strings
these are nice and bright
my tone knob has never been more useful
they are stainless steel and very smooth
it came down to the ac15 fender blues jr and the ibanez ts15
this is an amazing amp
even the acoustic sound is majestic
i think the ac15c1 is actually a better blues amp
one is the stock reverb
its really overboard in a way that i didnt find musical
i ordered a new tank and now its great
second would be an fx loop
i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice
probably one of the reasons its so affordable
its also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use
i managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck
they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks
i just sort of dealt with it
it sounds very nice especially for the low price
in a church setting this is obviously not an option
that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all
mine did not have this problem
im amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice
think of it as an affordable boutique amp
if you can pick one up used like i did all the better
fortunately it was a c1
its a value at full price also
this is a very high quality strap
the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship
however i dont like the plastic end pieces
they are large and  well  plastic
so im sending it back
this is mainly a matter of personal preference
if you dont mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap
to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed
your strap is now locked in place
cant wait to see how it does after it breaks in
this was a great choice and i couldnt be happier
i can see this strap lasting a long time
you can lock each strap button with one hand great product
i recommend going with these
the bullet style makes its easier to install
you know what i mean if you are a professional
they seat snug and enhances sustain
quality can be found behind the fender name
these original bullets are great for my strat
they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect
the strings sound great and hold up to the 34whammy34 just fine
sound great and look great
fender accessories 0733150406 pure nickel electric guitar strings custom are very good
so i and many others play nickel
what would that equate to  in hours
60 to 80 hours perhaps maybe a bit more
other than that great strings
these are the same strings i paid much more for in my store
the are the same as came on my guitar
the jam man solo is an amazing pedal
yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that
it is a very handy tool
another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats
if would 100 recommend this pedal to anyone
what more could you possibly ask for
a lot of nice features
great pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through
why i waited so long to get one i cant say
the instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps
this manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars
its got knobs and buttons
this makes me very happy
its well laid out and easy to get to all the settings
the work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple
the beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loop
fourth plays nice with computers
there you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them
fifth comes with an ac adapter
sixth you can add an sd card not included to expand the memory substantially
all of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience
the experience for me has been pure jamming joy
im having so much fun with it
just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal
we got a good deal too
really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it
if you dont mind spending the time to learn all its capabilities its great
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way
cause thats what this bad boy or girl to be pc does
there are others on the market to be sure
i had the boss looper with 2 pedals and it was noisy on playback
that was years ago and i couldnt get rid of it fast enough
this seemed to be the best choice for me
there are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers
for the price it should be and is great
this little wonder though is fantastic
my last thought on this this is a secret come closer
come on i wont bite
sounds simple but youll see
i am going to look for a decent one
this is a great pedal
does all i need it to do
stores 99 loops doubt id ever in my lifetime need that many
i havent tried the computer interface yet
it sounds great with little of its own noise
the percussion loops are fine  at least provide solid guides for recording
update  the software works well  is very useful
it loaded right up with no problem
thats the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal
more than worth it though
comes with a power supply
i have used the line 6 looper in the past line 6 jm4 looper
the line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier
that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere
and this one fit the bill
14 phone f  stereo 14 phone m
there are a few strange nuances though
this gets the track started before it clears it
not good if you were using it in a performance
however there are workarounds like just switching tracks
this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles
he was very happy with his gift
i got these for my dad for christmas
he loved them all and wont quit playing with them
a super cool little tin
rocks my world and back to the garden
i love the picks the tin they come in and the ease of use
if you are a beatle fan this is such a cute item
was more than i expected for the price
nice for collectable or to use
planet waves signature guitar picks  always the best always reliable
i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks
the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable
i thought the size of an altoid tin
just a little larger than a zippo lighter
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say
the thing is built like a piece of s
it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around
i used this 3 times and it shorted out
the lights started flashing and it got hot
well see how helpful they really are
i have always loved line 6
this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up
i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead
i am sorry to say that i returned it
my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs
i love the freedom the g30 gives me
im a real klutz with my cords
especially on the ml designed guitars
the sound is a lot more there
making you work on your technique and become a better player
sidenote  the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me
i suggest ordering some better ones
i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay
it is out there for 230 to 299
no buzzing and crackling and no more wires
no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords
finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless
all the soft clipping is there for every nuance
in fact i dont hear any interference at all even with a single coil
it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable
this is a professional wireless system
best purchase ive made this year
you wont be disappointed it is worth the price
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what id been searching for
apparently they arent easy to make
better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me
what it does  first a quick word about compression
a quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them
the pedal has knobs for output volume and sensitivity basically amount of compression
i consider this also to be a nonissue
tonesound quality  the sound quality of this effect is outstanding
the topend professional compressors keeley pedals rack units etc
are usually north of 200 which isnt practical for a casual player
and manipulate the external controls as needed
a second problem with the mxr custom comp is noise
these days on my pedal board i have several mxr micro pedals
ive been using mxr micro chorus for over 30 years
they just dont get any better than mxr
might be a little old fashioned but
you get what you pay for
wellllllllllll just give it a try
excellent pedal i love this chorus
it is perfect to me
the effect is really great
easy to use with one knob
and has nice high quality chorus effect
mxr built like a tank
works with my boss ds1 ac adapter too
very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal
if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy
this is a super easy to use pedal
dont worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound
it has about six knobs
it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived
just to find out it wasnt working
i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something
this is a simple analog chorus
this is the godzilla of volume pedals
it appears to be indestructible
volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results
if you need 34light34 maybe keep looking
if you dont mind the heft you will be pleased
it works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal
i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing
i decided to return it
i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal
the dunlop does not have that feature
i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it
built like a tank  brushed finish  connections on the front
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk
imports often have threads other than 14 inch sae
it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads
quick install works like a dream
this was exactly what i was expecting
seems to be better quality than other cheaper products i researched
es el output original de fender
que mas se puede decir
saludos  a todos desde venezuela
this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack
great price from the seller as well
if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets
just good ol genuine fender parts
nothing to complain about here
im a stickler for the oem parts so i typically by only fender stuff
thank god i buy spares
this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly
not for real heavy usage anyway
nice and snug with my american stage cables daddario is great
hey r ford uses them
great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these
great output jack i love this one much more because is more durable
works fine with any guitar
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician
three big ones are the jet sound choralflange and leslie speaker
first off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable
this unit sounds good and is adjustable
it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it
there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use
easy to install and works like a charm
i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar and what a difference
so at 8 this is definitely a win
good upgrade fender vintage springs
use 5 of them in my case and they work well
theres no substitute for the right part
the springs are almost always missing
cost less here than at guitar center so badabing
i purchased these to replace the springs on my usa standard stratocaster
these hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs
holds your trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends
theres too much tension to do it with your fingers
my american special strat came with 3 springs and now has the five
i find it stays in tune like a 34instrument34 should now
got this to put into my pseudocaster project guitar
be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar
if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model
the threads are smaller on these
it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness
make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance
if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up
this is intended to replace a mim 6 screw stratocaster bridge
it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm
thats why its so inexpensive
what you see in the picture is what you get
the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge
it was incredibly easy to install
and the sustain is improved
the springs in the back keep it back
the string tension keeps it balanced in the front
not the best but for the price was a killer deal
the block is full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles
like i stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality
im glad i replaced it
now i have a lot more guitar for my money
this was time and money well spent
excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic squire strat series
this bridge has more strength and solidness than the original
replace the tremelo arm with the one offered on amazon as well
this comes complete with bridge saddles and full size block
i dont think this is a true steel block
i believe its zinc alloy but thats fenders fault
i have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for squiers
they made my cv50s sound fuller with greater sustain
im sure ill buy more in the future
this is a cheap and easy upgrade
most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust
this is stage one of my rebuild
dont forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them
works for a cheap bridge on my cheap stratocaster knockoff
also this was priced right in my opinion
its not an entire bridge assembly but its exactly what i needed
in my opinion it is worth the money
you can mess around swapping parts pickups and capacitors
but the biggest change ive experienced is with the tone block change
does it give you more sustain
none that i can really tell
i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass
this is what is giving the deeper sound
i think it is about the actual mass
without debate this will add weight to your guitar
this is pot metal as well which again is fine
which is a common complaint and indicative of gfss crummy products in general
i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another
the strings have a nice feel to them
used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase
they improved the action considerably
very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar
with a twang twing twong nothing wrong
gotta love these strings that just wanna sing
i am revising my previous review on the 3250ls
i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks
why am i so impatient
but with every positive theres usually a negative
gb e were all flat on the fret side
they were already worn out
i love the sound but dont want to change strings every week
ive been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar
for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super 250s
these are solid strings that never let me down
they go in tune and stay in tune
i just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them
used them for years  always loved them
put them on an eric johnson strat
wouldnt use anything low quality for that guitar
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves
the heavy bottons 32 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone
the others 10 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also
i dont rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci
when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection
the high strings were plenty of flakes
if fender solved that it would be perfect
i say they sound great and are worth trying
i just order 3packs so i can have some on hand
thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster
too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly
these strings sound super awesome
these fit that requirement well
i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar
he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar
buy them you wont be sorry
plus wow its a great price
great grip slow wearing and they dont break
so give them a try
this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming
i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me
the textured grip surface is great
i have tried other picks like this that had points which went as confortable
this one is more confortable and has great grip
these things are so great
but not that big a deal
definitely recommend these if youre sick of picks slipping out of your hands
select your material select your weight and youre done right
these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them
i wouldnt touch anything but fender mediums for years and years
tried these on a whim
not i have piles and piles of picks going unused
short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do
but these picks are pretty amazing
not too hard not too soft
my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using
everyone has their own preference and i just didnt like the feel of those
i bought this 12 pack and they
i lost like 3 already but hey theres more
i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar
that was several months ago
i am still using these everyday
these 10 are not the ones he likes
i would not get these again in this size
the stiffness is just due to preference
i started using these a few years ago
picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps
ive always been partial to
i used the standard dunlop nylon for years
the max grip just is very difficult to drop effortless to hold on to
because its so effortless to hold i can focus my attention on other things
it feels little bit stiffer than regular
ive used these for years
i like the feel and texture of these 34pics34
they do the job brilliantly
they just arent quite my cup of tea
the nine leds really light up my music stand
thats why i got this
i needed light without the heat
other than that its fine and pretty well constructed
seems to take a few bangs without problems
it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m54 regal conductors music standquite well by itself
having said that for a 40 bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me
the switch is conveniently located on top of the light
the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move
the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product
it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design
and the carrying case makes it very portable
fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp
i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base
so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to
the unit uses three aa batteries
i prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord
i am an older person who has old eyes
sometimes lower c and lower a look alike
mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue
the light should go out
i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar
the gig bag is a square and softly padded
treat the light like it has no bag and youll be fine
ive owned a halfdozen led music stand lights over the years
this one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorry
the 9led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern
the light is twolevel  normal and bright
normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater
the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well
the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights
even if this one doesnt last ill keep buying more
provides a cool bright clean white light and will cover three or four pages
a  34musthave34 if you play in pits or other dimlylit venues
never used this seller or site for this purpose before
sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks
easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service
this seller is worth supporting
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock
i am pleased that they match my telecaster
straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need
very easy to install as compared to other systems
the system is a secure locking system
this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal
pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release
i have been using strap locks of all types for years
this new fender straplocks make installing them on the strap easy
i bought these for my new strat
they look great theyre easy to install and they work very well
my original review very easy to install didnt require drilling
i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes
overall a very good product
the best look and performance on a fender guitar
easy to install and have never failed me
these fender qr knobs came in and looked good on my schecter
i havent had any problems with them they installed just fine
it is a great lock and works fine but is not for me
this is one beefy string winder
buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits
this one works better than anyone i have tried
none of them work as good as i would like
once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results
this product does what it is designed to do very very well
it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully
i use it to wind my strings
i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast
this is a great winder
steel shaft will probably last
one of these should come standard issue with every guitar
on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy
for now ill stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb
well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa
but what is the point if it is so much inferior
what does anyone really want to know about a string winder
yes it will help you string your instrument quicker
and yes its still in one piece
i would buy it again
but they most certainly are not
this one built like a tank
its built for the long haul
this is the last one you will ever need to buy
this thing is a tank
i dont think you could break this beast if you wanted to
the last string winder you will ever buy
i have a martin hd28 with the large grover tuners
this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly
cant complain about a price like this
it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well
the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly
good unit for the money for sure
it is not road worthy however in our opinion
still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job
delivery packaging etc were very good
needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill
tripod base to get over stage cables and a boom arm with clips
be sure to check is the length of the arm is ok
these are slightly shorter than other stands i have
i did not think that an amp this size would sound good
this amp out does my old roland cube 60
and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound
all in all a super amp
i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it 5 stars
i dont think you will be dissappointed
i have purchased several amps over the last 7 months see the reviews
and really any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes
i also didnt want a modeler impersonating a tube
i loved the orange crush but it was totally unreliable
the amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior
like the crush or roland cube it has its own voice
ive heard it compars to a fender tweed in tone
but were talking 1000 tube amps
i dont have the matching extension cabinet because i just dont need it
i have a mustang iii and it gets destroyed by the zt
a friend plugged it into his marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous
really just stupid powerful for 300
for blues jazz or light rock its brilliant right out of the box
it has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility
i would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video
you simply will not find a negative thing about the zt lunchbox anywhere
roland fender line6 and others still have that niche dialed in
its not that it does not have it just could use more
however this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion
solos just sing on this amp
i feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better
the ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way
i stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good
i know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally
for a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill
micing for larger venues would work just fine
darn i meant to test before this review
i tested this and yes it does go louder for whatever the reason
the 12 club zt is super loud
1100 i rate this a 98 gear head satisfaction
check it out the reviews on youtube
it will overheat the amp and start acting weird
i would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both
i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year
people that say it is loud arent kidding but there are limits
the sound from the 65 speaker requires some space to develop
i use mine for practice at home and for lowvolume band rehearsals
if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed
it only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying
one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet
this is a big help at rehearsals
i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room
this is an overpriced item
that is my only complaint
theres enough reviews on here that state the obvious
how does an amp just come down half price over night
its like the blue blocker sunglasses
on tv theyre sold for 80
ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors
i stand by my logically opinions of this item
zt should not have sold this for 450 in the first place
it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name
the tone is very good but not exceptional
the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb
plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker
you need to do that with the speaker switch
the replacement amp exhibited the same problems
however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems
it has a year warranty period
all in all a beautifully designed and executed product
update 3112 so far so good
ive played through the amp for a couple weeks now and its great
clean low noise im used to the controls and love the sound of it
no need to even use my pod pro
also considering the lunchbox extension cab
always experimenting with my sound
now thinking about an eminence deltalite 12 neodymium speaker in a 1 cu
these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used
i started with the flimsy grays
a couple years ago i switched to yellows
recently ive been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the
for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this
your used to using big picks which strum hard easily
anyway the attack on this pick is so just
it flows in sweeps like
i will never switch from the pick
oh ya the grip is perfect
havent popped one outa my fingers yet
i love the size and wouldnt want anything larger
i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively
i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing
still in terms of grip they dont hold a candle to the max grips
both picks have their own unique tonal character
these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics
overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is bluesoriented
surprised there are so few reviews
edit  the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle
its getting easier with these
they are just the most wonderful picks ive used
im a bass player and so i dont deal with cut picks much
these picks are really hard and last forever
i did not notice any additional string wear or damage
these would probably better suited to guitarists
exactly what i was looking for
their grip is excellent and they feel awesome
about half the size of a regular pick
my fingers keep hitting the strings
will last forever sound great
a bit too thick for me
two disasters for classic rock music
however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks
unless you know what youre doing these things are too small
these are for lead and not rhythm
the picture wont show it but they are about the size of a dime
i only wish that more came in a single pack
these picks are a good change of pace
they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers
good investment for the price
i buy these for my son
he also likes the small size
they last forever and dont break
i used to lose a pick every other day
bought six still have six a week later
it has little geckolike protrusions that grip the e string
stays in place and cannot slip out
so be sure to try them out first before buying
one just cannot tell the size from the picture amazon has
i wont be buying these again
these were a very nice find
i checked in my case
luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these
as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird
the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well
like i said i love these things
this is not a pick for windmilling guitarists
this is a pick for the precision player
its really smallnoticeably smaller than the red jazz iii picks
with large fingers like mine it almost disappears
but the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it
ive always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work
danny gatton did so and i wouldnt have it any other way
these are the absolute best picks ive ever used
they dont wear down as easily as delrin tortex or some other materials
these picks are nice but just  too small
my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size
they work well just need to be a little bigger
as far as durability goes they are the reigning champs
i recommend these picks without reservation
i do like these picks too
it has a bit different sound obtained when i use this one
to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads
it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much
i use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming
i really like the fitfeel of this plucking pick
smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings
some nice picking with this pick
i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too
but the dunlop is better to me
these picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick
i use them for playing bass
they work well for that
i have not used them for a regular guitar
i prefer a standard pick for that
a very nice pick both in feel and texture
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15
i rocked all night and loved the sound
i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well
initially installed jj el84s after reading so many good reviews about them
they sound great to me personal opinion of course and are priced right
thought about new sensor mullard ris or sovtek el84m7189s
glad i went with the jjs and not looking back
im running 365vdc on the plates and 340vdc on the screens
first set one red plated slightly
bought a second set from dougs tubes ruby el84czs select matched jjs
performing nicely with a stock mim strat
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymore
jj seems to have a smoother sound than most
you dont need to spend big money for tubes
these jjs work really great
after a little break in these brought some new life back into my amp
greatly improved the tone over the stock sovteks that where in there originally
great product for a great price
these are considered boutique tubes but i think theyre popular for a reason
had for over a year hasnt failed
i purchased this to teach myself to play a keyboard instrument
this device has delivered everything i wanted and more
okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic
so what is the difference between the 235 and the 535
based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences
in my opinion the ypg235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck
buy a good sustain pedal
this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from
the pencil condenser are questionable
he paid about 350400 for his kit still cheap by todays standards
for fun i added one of the tomsnare mics and they sounded equally clear
didnt test microphones yet but i think this is best price for 7 microphones
according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well
the good inexpensivecontains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etc
i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal
mics i have tried yet
i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics
for the money i doubt you can beat these microphones
ive had no trouble with it that i can rememberthink of
this is a great microphone
its light sensitive and looks professional
i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording
all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for
with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response
been giggin since the early 70s and have been hosting an openmic to boot
i ordered two pdmic58s and they came with an xlr to 14 cable included
this mic is built like a tank yes as others have said
now im not a professional but this is just my opinion
its a great mic for the price
updateafter using this microphone for a while i find it to be somewhat lacking
dont get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should
this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm58
even plugged into my best preamps in studio
spend more money get some quality mics
these are only good for garage practice on a budget
i use it as a practice mic
its fine if no one hears you
but if your gonna use it live
just suck it up and buy a shure sm58
i would pay this price for just the element
i would recommend it to any friend and i already have
no onoff switch is a bummer but it works
solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience
we messed with the pa and all the electronics
the quality of this mic is just ok
if youve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one
i bought this for my kids aged 6  8 they love it
however it has not proven to be kidproof
using it as a back up stage mic
sound very good and for the price it cant be beat
great mic for the price
no but sounds pretty damn good
its light dont know if it would handle major abuse but wow
you really cant go wrong
plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup
it also looks pretty damn sharp
dont see how they even afford to make these things for this price
if you want a really good sm58 clone i would recommend a behringer xm8500
i dont think you are gonna find a better microphone
i just received this mic today and tried it out
i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers
this is a heavy solid high quality mic
are you kidding me at this low price
you cant beat this deal
so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics
i only meant to test it when i unpacked it
at that price its a steal
before supply and demand kicks in
how in the world can they sell a very good microphone for 15
the cord that comes with it is worth more than that
bought it to hear how my harmonicas would sound amped
very good sound quality plenty of gain
would reccommend this for voice or instrument use
has a 14in jack to easily plug into a guitar amp
you wont feel so bad when one falls off the stage  breaks
youll still have a nice cord you can use on any mic
works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation
very close to the sound of an sm58
i needed a cheap good quality mic and this fit the bill
i bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality
it costs 12 bucks great microphone for someone on a tight budget
very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best idea
for under twenty dollars pylepro cant be beat
for most singers it will be just what they need
i looked at all the wires inside and they look ok
nothing out of the ordinary
how do you beat it
great tone and tuning stability
was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat
i used it on a first act me501
such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz
worth every penny mind you
for the money you cant beat this cable
works with the new mic my daughter got for christmas and nice quality cord
no issues in over a year
must less expensive and just as good as others
the connectors are well fitted
fast delivery and a good price
ive bought an additional two since my initial purchase
gls is great quality and durable
i use there 100 30 and 25 cords and have never been disappointed
pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this
good quality xlr cable that works 100 fine
im happy with this purchase
for the working musician or home recording man this is great
i received my cables very fast
the xlr male  the xlr female are well built
no humm so that is a plus
good quality cord and connectors
i had zero noise level using these cords
seem to be of a good value
cords are cords but these are very nice packaged great good deal instant turnaround
easy affordable fast why go out
these guys did a super job getting them here fast
we are a tough act to follow
right so look for accesories and cablescords
at orange county and amazon
this is my 3rd set of cables i ordered from amazon
i needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one
works fine with my mixer
i guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working
i would see how this goes and update the review
they are not expensive to replace
some items of gls work great others are awful
dont trust the products anymore
they seem well put together and just feel nice
they also came with two velcro ties each
with proper care im confident these cables will last a very long time
i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good
it coils nicely and has good connectors
this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to
i was sure glad that i ordered this cable as a backup
it gets the job done and seems durable for my needs
work perfectly with my guitar good price
no problems with static crackling hum or other sound artifacts
great for amateur vocal recording like me
what we have here is an xlr male to xlr female black cable
if youre looking for some ridiculous review this wont be one
its a nice thick cable
its 25ft long as promised
it worked didnt arrive dead
this seems like a nice high quality cable
i have no clue im an amateur
thats really all its designed to do thus 5 stars
this was a great addition to our studio here at
the price was great and quality was awesome
gls cables are quality cables at a good price
then spend your savings on something else
ive been happy with all of gls products so far
they are very flexible easy to handle and of good quality
i am very satisfied with these cords and would highly recommend them
they work great for me
ill wait and see how they hold up in the log run
i havent had any problems with them at all so far
thanks guys will be shopping with you again
seems like it works just as described
purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home
i got this item much quicker than i expected
the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition
seller is a in my book
i use this for a microphone and it seems to be solidlybuilt
if i need more ill probably buy this again
so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest
using for audio acquisition for film  video purpose
so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h4 recorder
on the female side probably one few out of many lets hope
its those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china
overall though a great value for a quality cable
i read many negative reviews on several sites
there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments
this is what gives them their charm and voice
the set is quite nice for the price
i have that one too
this is a nicer set
pay the extra money and get this set
update  the letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly
if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly
nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great
also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun
a very attrative complete assemblage of blues harp
with one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have
i play harp with some some that i perform
the c harp was terrible
that said the only thing i like about this order is the case
i going to see if i can return them for store credit
hohner has been around forever well constructed instrument and very reliable company
let me start by saying that i never even opened these
ive given it a 3 star merely out of respect for hohner
not from music123 it doesnt
when i asked music123 about this they said oh
youd be silly not to bite on that right
save your money and order this through musicians friend
do yourself a favor and avoid them
ill use the case for my higher end hohners as needed
straight from the case these dont bend well but do not despair
nice and thick the adhesive is very strong
i have used it on microphone electronics to shield out rf noise
if you hear hum its not the shielding its your technique
you really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly
this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster
i had some noise even at moderate volumes
after shielding it is absolutely quiet
i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build
there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups
easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass
you receive 3 felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick
but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument
but over time this starts to disappear
the picks are pretty comfy to hold
sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings
tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results
these picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side
i was looking for a semisoft felt picks
i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele
i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke
i guess i dont like the way the uke sounds when using them
it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff
but i am sure other people may disagree
i use the picks occasionally
yes i would recommend them to other uke players
i would like to let people know they are very stiff
i guess i thought being felt they wouldnt be so stiff
the pics also shed easily making your instrument dusty in no time
i recomend trying one out some time
this is a 5 star stand considering the price
i dont forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough
i bought two of these one for each of my sons 12 and 14
so far they seem awesome
they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them
definitely not a flimsy stand
bag was ripped so i almost lost the screw and washer
this will work fine for me i think
i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions
im completely satisfied with this
a great item for the price
comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble
each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand
it took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions
it looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands
i am very satisfied with my purchase
i bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice
should last her a very long time
i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows
for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality
solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly
works just like its supposed to
i have two complaints about it though
the part that holds the music isnt as wide as other stands
its just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper
adjusting the height and tilt is difficult
unlike every other music stand ive used that one can simply force into position
no slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwards
i love the fact that the feet do this
these are excellent music stands
those flimsy backless music stands are worthless imo especially on a breezy evening
my bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors
i guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag
the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools
this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble
needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag
its adjustable and allows me to fit a clampon microphone boom arm
saves space at cramped gig sites
dont lose the wing nut though
not worth lowering to 4 stars though
easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones
this is an all metal exc
for the adjusting screw stand fullsizedfor 20 bucks
these stands are great for my lesson business
yea how could a music stand be amazing
well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent
it stays where you set it and works wonderfully
clips onto pretty much any mic stand
the movable head is awesome
it provides at extra layer to reduce the ps fs ts etc
surprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it
it is flexible yet stationary
this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build
this is a pop filter
it does a fantastic job at that
works solid looks solid and had a good price
i would recommend it to anyone
i really like this pop filter
i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target
also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order
a well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product
also the clamp works well
i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone
sounded lovely for the first hour thats why two stars
there are other wonderful strings fremont flouros worths etc
but aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound
please just try a set of aquilas and you will hear a major difference
the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke
installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they wont do magic
i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings
i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good
it is amazing what difference the strings can make
i have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings
your uke is going to come with crappy strings change them to aquilas
everywhere you read these are the strings to have
what else can be said about aquila
high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best
as a guitar player i recently march 2013 started to play the uke
i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument
these string play good and stay in tune pretty well
best ukulele strings i have found to date
and ive been playing stringed instruments and ukus for quite a while now
i bought these for the soprano ukulele i bought for my little great niece
i dont need to use them myself
i also have the same quality strings on my baritone ukulele
the strings are very good
everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings
i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings
they are simply the best there is for a fair price
not much more can be said about these awesome strings
stop reading this and order them
great sound and stays in tune
will definitely make any uke sound great
love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks
it does not work well with a daisy chain power supply
with this set up the second channel will distort a bit
the balance between quality and price is good
the depth of  sound sounds great
i love all the options you get with this pedal
my newest amp the marshall jvm410 joe satriani replaced the reverb with noise gates
a function i absolutely love
but then i needed a reverb pedal
ive been using it for a few weeks and im extremely happy with it
one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb
it fails to sound right
analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce
the hall setting is wonderful
rich but not too over powering
the ab switch is kinda a nice touch
much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer
so my baby boom does the trick
its close enough for my needs
didnt want to spend 150 for a reverb so gave this a try
recreates spring reverb very accurately
for the price you cant go wrong
i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim
its definitely the best verb its price range
you can dial in some pretty lush tones
thered is also an ab switch that is almost a tone mode
a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient
all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on
the 2nd one works flawlessly
seems very durable switch and jacks are quality
for lt 75 shipped i certainly cant complain
if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it
can get all of the reverb sounds you want
ive been using it for nearly a year now
i was going to buy the boss rv5 when i somehow discovered biyang
the 3 modes are nice
more than enough decay and wetness
im not ashamed of having chinese clones on my board
in fact i highly recommend biyang whenever somebody asks about it
well i didnt expect much due to the price
but trust me this thing is really good
ive tried eh nano grail
i own the holier grail
ive heard the boss verbs
and i really like this one
save your money this pedal is good enough
ill make a video and post it soon
this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal
most of the popular options or 100 and up
theres a multiswitch for hall spring and room
i just picked up a pod hd500 and i love it
you can use it in a number of different ways
everything is tweakable assignable and flexible
they trust their users to read the freaking manual
im amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs
want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay
for live performance this thing would be perfect
you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves
the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects
its built like a tank
truly a great piece of gear
ive had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone
right out of the box the hd 500 totally blew me away
this is not the case with the hd 500
there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time
the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd 500 are amazing
its a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part
the build quality over the pod x3 live has improved
the case is now entirely metal vs
a combination of metal and plastic
i can definitely see this being heavy roadgig worthy
got it a while back but have just started to explore its capabilities
there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things
am sure you will too
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
before we get started i am more pro than amateur
and i feel that way about music
i adore the sound of this unit
forget about all the presets
theyre probably all as useless as you imagine they might be
first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x3live
just forget about trying to use the display
next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by its specs
lets say you use an xt or a x3
think about what youre used to
you start with 8 fxsubtract effect banks for
volume pedal you need to use an effect bank
so i have to do it in the loop i guess
fx loop only works with an effect bank
noise gate used to be always available
wah this is always available and active in the x3 and below
the x3live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot
in addition to all the other fx too
you need to dedicate an fx bank now
you might only have 3fx left
what if you need delay and modulation
i have to rethink the way i use fx in this box
still evaluating how that will work for me
all my guitars have piezo bridges
i will have to use an acoustic preamp
you could do something similar on the x3live
how complicated can that really be
for some of you its still a viable option
you also still might need your other fx
far and away my favorite amp model evah
dont leave any room for modulation or other special fx
im not a switch whole patches on the fly guy
i turn fx off and on
so am i complaining about these limitations
because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary
heck yes it sounds that good
with no additional outboard gear if i didnt want
im only nitpicking so that you will know all the tradeoffs
i thought id miss it but i dont
youll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum
my own opinion about this is i love it
i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday
direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring
that being said it is good for practice and song writing
used this for more than a year and finally sold it
this gls mic cable is working well
gls continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price
ive only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well
the cover is supple and easy to coil
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works
it is what i expected it to be
i bought an ibanez concert size uke
my uke does not fit well in the stand
thus any uke that is concert size or greater
so most ukes dont fit well
they fit just not well
now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it
this small stand does not hold most all ukes
this is not a lightweight stand
i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs402b mini stand
oh well for once i got cheap
and got burned for it
all in all not great this tiny stand
one stand fits not all
its just an imperfect design
my take on it your mileage may vary
at the time i bought was 16
mine arrived broken so it had gone back
reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken
not upset about that  stuff happens
it is just not a good stand
light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped
5 stars to amazons return policy thouh
this stand does its job quite well
i have nothing but praise for them
this stand is useful for small instruments
fits my tenor uke and violin just fine
is compact once its folded up
the price was  awesome
i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment
i plugged in my martin hd28 and all went well
so in short id buy it again
do not let the size of this little amp fool you
i have used roland and fender amps and pas
i use it for my small solo gigs
but it will cover a good size room also
great vocal and guitar sounds
it wont break the bank and it wont break your back
other than that this is a great amp
if you buy 34items sold from amazon34 you can depend on free shipping
so know that going in
on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for 360 to 380
got it to my door for 304
5 stars just for service
the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better
now this is one great piece of kit
as a dedicated nylonstring player im always looking for the holy grail of amps
is the mini sent from heaven
the master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular
cool tube piezo tone from my shencpk8t is dropdead gorgeous
perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and depiezo the tone
they cost more than the mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow
appearance  build  the loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures
and it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my ta50r
its the most delicate amp ive owned
final blurb  my feelings about this amp are mixed
for value and use as a wee pa its a 5 star deal
so 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction
it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp30
amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do
actually it was really easy to install
i just losen 6543 string and just put it in and it was over
i use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there
it was a pain to take out too
however it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar
it did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall
something you might want to think about before getting one of these
for years i have fell more and more in love with my yamaha cgx111sc
high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes
i wanted to experiment with this item
the sound is richer and clarity makes unique
let me first start off with the sizing
when they say fits soundholes from 3375  35 they really mean it
the edges did not catch completely  and it looks terrible
you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard
the main issue is the sound
however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes
for me that does not justify it
a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less
in practical terms no not for this sort of item
this is great but i needed an actual soundhole cover
i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt soundhole cover
when it comes to music it is34 that little extra34 that makes the difference
the planet waves oports gives me that extra
this does what it says it does
anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole
my washburn d30s will never leave home without one
i then tried one on my breedlove custom revival om with poor results
put this on a gibson j45
tried it on a martin d28
louder focused and projects much better  almost resonatorlike
fantastic for slide or capod high
in my sample of 2 it made highend guitars sound worse
if you cant afford a better guitar may be worth a try
but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at soundhole
adding the oport deadened the lows
it just didnt provide any plus at all anywhere else
but this product was a waste to me
not sure if it did improve my sound or not
i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldnt really tell that much
very pleased with this item
definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight
for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable
maybe i should get that for cheaper
i accidently bought large ooh boy is it like windshield sun reflector size
sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose
the mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance
it is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar
spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat
i use this for working on my guitars mainly
it does the job well and is pretty large
its very soft and padded as well as anti static
it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up
it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen
havent had any problems with it at all so far
my friend has commented on its bright color  youll never lose that thing
i hope hes right cause i love this little tuner
works well and easier to read than many of its competitors
i have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetishcom which works well
i bought this just to see what everyone was raving about
it is better than my intelli 600 which i also like
the colors and lighting make it very easy to read
it has no problem with the low e string
the only thing i find worse than the intelli is the gooseneck
while it is very adjustable the intell folds flat which i really like
the snark is well worth its small price
one of the best tuners out there
it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order
very happy with this purchase
its been great so far
has worked very well so far
i will buy another one of this
ive had the same tuner for years
it tunes better than any tuner ive ever used
i had it close but its the fine tuning that really helps
i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one
spot on tuning  very bright display and super fast and easy to use
i am editing my earlier review
i bought 2 of these about 6 months ago
the other has some kind of short in it
it drains batteries almost overnight
when i take the batteries out no problem
good product good service should be fine for years to come
i have one in my main guitar caseses
accurate little accessory only works with guitars
only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar
this was for a friend who plays guitar
he used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results
i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn1
at home or on the go i cant see the need for another tuner
even a kid can use it with a guitar
i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune
better go back to the diapason
it does a good job for the price
i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps
easy to use seems to be well made
having to look at the beating heart while you play is very difficult
the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish
everything should be this easy to use and work this well
i have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners
the snark sn1 is by far the best
much more fun than a black box
i own one of each model
the sn1 is a musthave as far as im concerned
i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner
if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case
much easier  you dont need to select your tuning or anything first
you can also just clip it to a nearby desk
buy this with confidence  youll love it
the electronics themselves have held up admirably
the screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time
ive banged mine around a bit and its stayed in one piece
the plastic is solid but not unbreakable
easy to operate easy to read
i bought this as a second tuner for gigs
easy to use easy to see
you will not be disappointed
there is a problem with the design
for 10 bux each  why not
it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever
nothing to complain about here 5 stars all the way
for some reason this one just doesnt hit the notes right
i have tried it several times and it just doesnt tune right
then i recheck with my other brand and its not even close
maybe i just got a bad one
i like that this one shuts off automatically
but again its way off tune
i did like the style size and color
but it doesnt work right so its like running with a flat tire
i have them all and they all work great
been playing for five decades now
used to tune with a tuning fork
then later used a boss tu12 for years
the snake took its place
no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in
the readout is easy to see in any light
the list goes on but i think you get the point
oh and did i mention accurate
yeah i think i did
i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar
it is accurate and easy to use
most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external powerpedals
in addition i couldnt use those on my acoustics
snark solves all of these problems
the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item
it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together
this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund
warehouse deals are not such good deals
works on everything i own which is 3 acoustics and 1 gretsch hollow body
great sensitivity and i love the metronome built in it as well
this is the 2nd tuner like this that i have purchased
it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
small price to pay to be in tune
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case
its easy and clear and everything a tool should be
its fast and easy just like a tuner should be
34  but i lost it
so now i get brighter colored ones
it still works but thats a design flaw
but it works well and the batteries seem to last
the display is easy to read and easier to use
the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy
a definate must for any guitar player
i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget
i use it often but find it is not very accurate
i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better
if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference
i wholeheartedly endorse the product
i am absolutely delighted with this tunner
i am always very careful when turning the 34head34
as far as tuning goes i am very pleased
his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use
i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner
this is the best invention since the wheel as far as im concerned
its incredibly easy to use and very handy when restringing a guitar
bottom line this is my favorite headstock tuner
this tuner the snark fits on my godins small headstock with no problems
on a dark stage this works great
i love this little tuner
i love this tuner so much
for the price this is the best tuner out there right now
i just cut the volume on my guitar snark senses vibrations through the neck
works great right out of the box
easy to use and accurate
a must have for any guitar player
turn it on clip it on and tune
works well tunes tight and is cheap
when the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works
what more is there to say
this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie
if you like being in tune this is probably for you
great design easy to read works better than 2 other brand tuners i own
tiny and seems to be accurate
the price is darn good as well
a must for all guitarists
what can i sayi love this thing
i bought three more after trying the first one
i put one in each of my guitar bagscant live without it
the tuning is excellent and so easy
if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it
i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
the display is very easy to read
i love the colors and the matte finish too
first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand
i am definitely proud of this product
will be buying more in the future
i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin
it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price
it goes with us when we travel with our guitars
the tuner workss as advertised
for 10  which is also half the price at your local guitar shops
the product works as advertised and amazon has the best deal
1540 people like itwho am i to disagree
but for the price it does work a lot better
for a while i had the sn5 tuner
but i bought this one and im glad a did
the product picture can be a little deceiving
the color is a a metallic blue almost navy
its got some good features although i dont use them
ill use nothing but snarks
excellent tuner with one flaw
using it couldnt be simpler and it has excellent contrast
update 4413  added back a star
even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results
i recently purchased a replacement the sn8b but found it really disappointing
so much so i may send it back
so i just ordered another one of these
for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand
i love this little guy
very easy and simple to use
the snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything ive ever seen
after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better
i will never be without one again
i like many things about this tuner
unlike the fender which you have to press and hold
still you cant go wrong either way
i like them so much i bought another one
they work better than tuners costing ten times as much
you dont have to be a rocket scientist to use it
its so simple a child can use it
its very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without
it uses one cr2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included
you have to install the battery which is no big deal
this is a great product
it is easy to use
adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument
i havent banged it around but have had no problems with durability
bright easy to read display
i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike
its a great little tuner
super vivid easy to see color
the clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built
this is a great buy for the money
the snark i chose has been working just great for me
very light so i leave it on when i play
wonderful price and great product
love mine and have recommended to every musician i know
works great and love the colorful display
this is really quite a fantastic little gizmo
it functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun
it is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way
quite amazing especially for the price
it does know when your guitar is in tune
does it for you so you dont have to do it by ear
brings your instrument into deadon ringing true tune across the instrument
works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars
highly recommended for the price
theyve come out with the sn8 i hear which ill buy soon
dont leave home without it
i bought this one after using the sn2 for 5 months
the tuner works like a champ
i cant really tell the difference between the sn1 and the sn2
they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat
after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was
snark has a good tuner for low price
theres really nothing i can add to whats already been said about this tuner
i teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner
i took a look at it and knew i had to have one too
its soft and rubbery feeling and wont scratch your guitar
i like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it
you dont have to hold it or put it on your leg
it is a  great product
for the price this is a great deal
very very good tune result
it really put yout guitar in tune
but the arm is so fragile
im a semipro player and this tuner is all i need
a great buy worth the money
this tuner is nice  inexpensive and very easy to use
it is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier
i highly recommend this tuner
solid tuner more accurate than i anticipated and very easy to use
excellent little device for the money
i have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well
this will get you in tune for 11 or less  cant beat it
i own several of the snark tuners
the sn1 settles quickly and works with a wide array of instruments
the sn1 senses frequency through vibration
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
it reacts quickly and is not oversensitive
easy to read and for the very low price a great value
that may have damaged a contact
i would buy another one without hesitation
this product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately
this is a great little tuner
used it for more than a year with no issues
fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar
if it was a choice between the 2 the planet waves wins hands down
one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune
with this little gadget there is no guess work
i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon
its so dim i can barley see the reading when i squint
ill be buying another one and trying it again
good tuner unlucky with two lemons i guess
this is the best clip on tuner out there
highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro
mine broke and so did my friends
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it
i will try to get a replacement
the snark sn1 is small accurate and easy to use
now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners
so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles
i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it
i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic
easy to use and very accurate
it makes tuning a breeze
i received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar
this is the second one i have and it works well
i would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player
i was pleased for that
id definitely recommend this product to a friend
its a nice little tuner and my guitar is sounding great
this is a very well made product
i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin
these are a great deal
it just uses vibration of the instrument
these tuners including the red version are the best
the snark is the easiest and most stable to use
im very happy with the size of the sn1
its small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus
i had to tune my guitar and i bought this
i got the sound i wanted
ive bought quite a few tuners over the years
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner
update  the more i use this tuner the more i like it
when this arrived i didnt realize it was that small
thought it has to be so its out of the way
then i thought this thing cant work very well but it does perfectly
i was surprised by the size
the tuning is deadon and couldnt be more convenient
since its based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise
just clip it on and swivel the head to face you
i really like the design
attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice nonslip surface
the display is bright and the interface is very intuitive
you just press the button and start plucking strings
in addition snarks customer service was very friendly and helpful
for the money i figured why not
this clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use
the face pivots around and the display is nice and bright
i will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases
this tuner is easy to use
this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase
i have seen people complain about battery life
the display is good and the tuners work well
i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity
i think it is a well made product and good value
there is nothing worse than a bunch of outoftune loud guitar players
the snark sn1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate
another thing is the price point which is simply amazing
ive got a bunch of these little tuners i keep one with each instrument
tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice
this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy
why you would almost think i know what i am doing
this was a great purchase
my son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford
he would definitely purchase from here again
who doesnt love these tuners
easy to use easy to read and has options that i dont even use
ive tried the fishman ft1 and the tune tech ttm201
i like this one the best
it seems as accurate as my other tuners
oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech
i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner
i dont have to guess or squint
it has a metronome which can be fun
if not then the fishman is more your speed
seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound
sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and its okay
i also have the ns micro and thats a better tuner
i bought this because i got tired of looking up byear tuners online
its so darn simple to use
just clip it on tap the big button and play a note
it was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners
works right out of the box
easy to read easy to use
arrived very fast inexcellent shape
having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier
the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it
at these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments
these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick
i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though
but i would use no other tuner on stage
i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars
i have dozens of guitars
very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass
small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case
if you buy this you really need to baby it
my advice is look for a more sturdy model
i used to tune my guitar online
however adding a 10 for this item is worth it
it is so accurate and works great so far
moreover theres also a warranty for this item
awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere
much cheaper online too for the price its a steal
i wasnt expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner
i have to say it is one good funny lookingclip on tuner
i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything
like the capo and metronome feature
i just really like this little guy
it also is bright and is very accurate
if looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further
it is 100 accurate and very easy to use
other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money
i use this tuner to tune up my violin
this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings
this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments
just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds
you can easily set your intonation with this little monster
works great in extremely loud environments
you dont have to plug into it
cons  a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass
works great seems durable shipped fast
cant think of a single negative thing about this product
if you need a tuner this ones a good one
yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference
i wish it were brighter and easier to see
still its a very good tuner overall
the tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks
it works with all of them
it looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes
finally do not drop these
the head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily
it has a ball joint construction
that is good and seems to hold up to use
i do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them
when you do 6 out of 10 times the plastic socket will break
i have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base
they still tune but i have to hold them against the guitar
they do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient
i thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk
but this tuner destroyed those expectations
its a small smart tuner
so many functions and just a great design
this attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter
which you would expect with all the other stuff it comes with
this is just the tuner i was looking for
it works on vibration or mic so its very versatile
it works on my acoustic bass electric and my mothers voice
havent tried the trumpet yet
intuitive and the backlit screen is so easy to see
this tuner is very accurate
it is well made and stays on without falling off
i tested it with other tuners and its right on
easy to see when positioned correctly
i like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic
be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off
would i buy it again
going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate
looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way
this is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner
the vibration mode is really good
i havent fooled with the other features metronome
so i cant comment about them
my fault but it shouldnt have broken so easily
the sn2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn1 doesnt
this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use
its easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not
the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes
my current one i bought in july and so far everything is holding up
i bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp i play guitar
she has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome
unfortunately it doesnt fit on top of our harp
it does however clip into the sound hole okay
it tunes the harp fairly well
i also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly
display is very easy to read and lights up nicely
i was tuning in a dimlit room and was able to read it perfectly
im sure it would be great on a dark stage
otherwise it gets a big hard to read
but positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily
easy to see easy to use easy to get used to
you cant beat the price for such a great little tuner
amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience
i will be buying one for every guitar case i own
easy to use and handy for any string instruments
only thing i regret is not getting one sooner
there are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well
cant even tell if it is on or off
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode
the screen could be a little brighter
im so glad i was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago
after checking each string multiple times
i guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy
i play a taylor 414ce
the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow
if you play a string instrument this one is a must
i have several and a snark for each one
five stars for performance take away one for greed
and another comment in 2013
i was shocked when i got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was
thats a huge range for any tuner
recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges
ive used electronic tuners for a long time
most of them that ive owned you have to plug into your instrument
i used that korg until getting the snark
this snark will tune about anything
it senses the entire scale
the display pivots to any angle
it is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock
i dont think you should drop it very often
so far ive dropped mine once with no damage
it really gets around and tunes them all
the color is sort of a metallic red almost candy apple red
i ordered spare batteries but havent needed to change one yet
im sure theyll use it often
this tuner is a real good buy at a good price
ive never used the metronome feature other than to check it out
it flashed a locked tempo but i really dont need that feature
i purchased this to use with my old yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele
it works great on both very accurate and easy to use
it appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument
i like this tuner as much as my sn8
just clip it on and tada
if your dog loves toys keep this out of reach
i had to have one
love it love it love it
i recommend this to all musicians
clamp it on and play
it is of course difficult to tune when others are playing around you
i found the mic tuner isnt as accurate
also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily
i use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc
i bought two more you will love this tuner
other than that works great i like using it
very nice clip on tuner for the price
this tuner is amazing even more so considering the price
its chromatic so it will tune anything
i tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it
ive bought three for gifts
sooooo everything i said initially is still true
its a fantastic little tuner
but ive broken two of them
tight tuning and easily used
very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price
it does what a guitar tuner should do
i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice thats about half price
better deal if you dont just buy one and have to pay single shipping
easy to use portable cheap
for most of us this is more than adequate
i buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases
bright display easy to use works well and cheap
i have bought several of their models
i hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries
newer models seem a bit beefier
here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
the display is very easy to read
i love the colors and the matte finish too
i highly recommend these tuners
they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin
they also work well with acoustical guitar
so this was my first real tuner its very simple to use
great tool and has two different modes which is cool
great precise tuning with the sn2 versus the other snark versions
i would only go with the sn2
very cool gadget and well executed
i have not tried it with other stringed or nonstringed instruments
the thing is quick and accurate
the display colors are bright and easy to read
it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing
it clips on easily and firmly
for 10 bucks its a great piece
works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass
battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it
this is my second after breaking the last ones neck
one is an inline tuner one built into my amp
this is my favorite go to tuner
every one in my band uses this tuner
it works for guitar and bass
its easy to read and dead on
i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use
however it broke not too long after i bought it
one of the connections broke that is
i think they might have made it a little more durable since then
moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool
it would be nice though not to have had to do that
it does the job well
a review mentioned it didnt come with batteries
i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews
it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe
i know it can do standard tuning i just cant figure it out
easy to work with and also easy to find
the price is also right and i recommend
the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use
its a very worthwhile purchase
the arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into
i do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable
just be extra careful handling them
weve been only using it for two days and so far so good
there are many clipon tuners but i liked the following about this tuner 1
you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic
can set different pitch than a4404
not expensive was less than
no stress whatsoever indeed its just as quick and smooth as my boss
lcd is bright and clear and needleish display works as expected
it worked very well on violin too
and a note about the looks
its tiny and doesnt look like a fisherprice product
i have 7 of these bad boy tuners and i love them
good quality accurate and not expensive
highly recommended and 5 stars
both by vibration and mic
not even a year old
this chromatic clipon tuner is the best of the best
one cannot go without having one for the price
ive tuned violins guitars and ukeleles with it
this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without
this little instrument tuner does everything
you just cannot be without one
sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or halfstep higher
it uses a cr2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time
it will tune practically anywhere   loud rooms etc
extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this
the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark
i have been in need of a tuner for far too long
i was turned on to this and i was truly blown away
the tuner is very accurate and compact
i leave it on my guitar all the time
the clamp is strong enough that it will stay put
my old one lasted a long while and it still works
these tuners are just awesome
i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners
they all work fine for me
however the snark sn2 just has the edge
its performance look and feel are great
the added features are also a plus
i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar
its my go to for chromatic tuner
for a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat
these are a staple on every single guitar in our band
bright and easy to read
this is without a doubt the best guitar tuner i have ever used
stopped working all by itself
fortunately ive another plus a korg and an two intellitouch
ive 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsthe intellitouch is simply champion
the sn2 senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone
this is a great tuner
i play guitar mandolin and ukelele
ive paid a lot more for a lot less
the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles
and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner ive ever used
it doesnt require a loud volume to hear the tone
all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
got this for a 15 year old learning guitar
they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner
my how things change when you can see what is really going on
just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string
a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments
it works better than my piano
i can trust that i will be in tune
it is dead ballson accurate quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight
handy well made small easy to see
great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to
i also like the capo tuning feature
you put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x
i highly recommend this tuner
the design of this product is innovative and excellent
i wonder how i ever lived without it before
this is more for your parlor acoustic setup
fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate
this little tuner is so easy to use and see
i bought two more as presents
the price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel  correctly
i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky
calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red
still i cant fault its tuning prowess
its quick and pretty on the money
it replaced my roland boss tu12h
i love the red the swivel head the green
i have purchased several snarks of all different types
fast accurate and a joy to use
my young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one
all snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner
so in short this is a mixed bag
combined with the absolutely deplorable build quality of the clip itself
its such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends
only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer
and i love this tuner
25 stars rounded up to 3
original reviewi have had similar tuners in the past
and by similar i mean clip on
really glad i tried it out
no more chasing pitch for me
planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well
i got this after seeing many of my church friends using them
it does all of them well
im going to buy a couple more as gifts
this is a great tuner
the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read
it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously
the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate
these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
i cant believe what you can get for the price on this one
tunes all my instruments fast and easy
the display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever
the color of the device
the interface is great and the clip works well
and its so cheap it wouldnt matter if you lost it
this device has really help me
i am new at trying to learn
i have a long way to go
i am a novice guitar player
does exactly what it says itll do
right out of the box
correctly tuned this very old guitar for the first time in years
a quality tuner for a low price
very durable and gets the job done
these sell for about 2025 in the real world
i paid a bit over 12 and it was an amazon prime purchase too
the display is better than most ive used dating back 30 years
and was actually pleasantly surprised that the snark sn2 had a mic
one less accessory in the little bag now
di am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however
mmm i would still highly recommend using an audible metronome
this is the second clip on tuner i have bought
this is much better than the other brand i have
its easy to use and see
the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite
the built in tap metronome is a cool idea
if youre shopping for a tuner give this a try
this is a very versatile tuner
i like cool gadgets  and this is no exception
the red color is a metallic color  and i totally dig it
the display is nice and bright as well
well worth it for the price
much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning
i cant recommend this enough and the battery last a long time
i havent had to change mine in almost two years since ive had it
just a great overall tuner
i purchased this item sometime in august and think its pretty good
i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember
pretty simple it does what its supposed to do
price is right for entry level
only thing keeping it from 5 stars
still for the money a great buy
this tabletop mic stand works
well designed and made from descent enough materials
very good for light portable set ups
that said do it wrong and plunk
will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only
great for carrying with you
it was my fault not to check out its measurements before purchase
but its not the reason why i drop by one star
the reason is its not designed properly
im 511 i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still
as a result i feel im  either too tall or too short
build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten
overall a four stars product imo
this was so inexpensive i couldnt pass it up
folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag
i just toss it in my gig bag and im always ready
here are my pros and cons
its about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball
after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic
it seems sturdy and well built
the legs make this thing very very wide
the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird
overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand
it is so small that it cannot hold all mics
i use this short stand for micing my guitar amp cabinet
the adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably
i also purchased a musicians gear   http www
this unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some
i you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand
it even comes with a case with two zippered sections
one for the stand and and one for a mic
there is also amic holder
i will probably get another
its lightweight but very stable even with a heavy bass drum mic
a great bargain for a very sturdy useful product
worked out of the package and was cheap
longevity yet to be seen
great match for your bedroom amp
these cables are no different
ill just nip the ends off if i need to replace them later
i have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so its probably fairly wellshielded
love the coil love the price
this a great cable for practicing at home
coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles
28 coiled plug end to plug end
thus it is pretty short even when stretched out
not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore
i just ordered mine two weeks ago
i bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar
what surprised me was how it improved the sound
i really like this cable
it probably stretches 1012 feet if you really need it too
overall its a solid cable for practice
the epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days
the curly cable has fared much better
no problems works great and doesnt tangle so it stores easily too
great as a primary or backup cable
these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good
bad points  1 the package it comes in says its a 20foot cable
of course this would not result in 20 feet when its stretched
i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p
works as described on the ipad
for the price id expect a more durable product
thank goodness amazon doesnt sell this gadget for the fortydollar retail price tag
i just got mine today and tried it out
the sound quality complaints are no joke
still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool
until then thisll be a fun toy to play with
march 29 2012  just a quick addendum to my initial review
it sounds much much better now
no more hiss no more static
what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss
my guitar i guess but who cares
i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else
well that is beyond me
works perfectly with iphone and ipad
the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed
but it hasnt broke yet and it might never break
works perfectly with ear buds with miccontroller
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs no success
i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box
but for my purposes with a 3gs it is a brick
was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this
i was very disappointed when i tried this thing
also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables
update  july 8 2012
i added two stars to the product
the hd sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great
this guy not so much
it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy
i upgraded and would absolutely do it again
it is fast enough to use real time during intonation practicetraining on fretless bass
it works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments
if you can afford it the peterson is the best clipon tuner out there
sat on my snark  good tuner but takes some patience
no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc
this is my first strobe tuner
so far it has been wonderful for intonationinitial setups
the only thing i dont like is that the housing feels cheap
update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer
i really like this tuner
it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric
as my reviews demonstrate im a sucker for a new tuner
peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners
the typical clipon tuner has an lcd needle
when the needle is dead center the string is tuner
if its short of center the string is flat
if its past center the string is sharp
a string is in tune when the rings stop rotating
ive already returned the tuner
the sc1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars
i also use one on my pedal board wouldnt use anything else
since the mic has a built in interface you cant use any other
i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio
some other mxls like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end
when using the mxl 24 usb in win 7 no driver download is necessary
it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold
there are also output adjustments as well
i moved the slider up and bang it worked
it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable
its built like a rock  has a very fine finish
the grill and the frame around the grill are solid
i was surprised at how heavy the base was
it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place
its not some cheap plastic
the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl 2010 multipattern studio mic
plug it in via usb and you literally on your way
the software installation is optional
the microphone works without it
windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups
i occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls
im also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast andor recording audiobooks
even the case impressed me
the travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself
the microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand
one thing i didnt like was having reaper pushed on me
i installed reaper and immediately disliked its interface
i didnt like its tone so i uninstalled it
mxl really should reconsider its association with reaper
i tested the microphone on a phone call using google voice
i also tested it with audacity in recording my voice
again i was very happy with the results
the packaging materials said that i should have received a cd in the package
and im still waiting to hear back
so reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding
the very first appearance is impressive
theres a nicelycompartmentalized carrying case
the mic looks good but has almost no mass
i set up a shootout in my studio
i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles
for a comparison mic i used an akg perception 420
to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way
it was quieter with a much better midrange
these were things i could easily hear
but thats not a complete comparison
thats a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses
theres also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level
im unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it cant be undone
this leaves the level controlsa place where mxl could have been more careful
it takes some doing to figure out which does what
theres a highpass filtertremendously useful when rumble is a problem
but we dont know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain
i hope its analog but theres nothing about it in the documentation
then theres the biggest problem
the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for
i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that ive had for years and years
this mxl is usbonly 4448 only
you cant easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues
to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer
if youre a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration
of course there are plenty of other choices for that application
but i think thats the best light to shine on this one
too much noise with one spot
outlets 182113 can all be used to power either 9v or 12v pedals
outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time
if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise
like outlets 182113 outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9v and 12v
outlet 6 is a 12v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power
most of my pedals are 20 to 30 ma
so potentially i could have 40 plus pedals in a chain
once you8217ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play
dont even think about it
its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly
weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down
i picked up an old boss me6b that required the boss bra120 power supply
it also has a different size connector
using  the 12vac output on my fuel tank chameleon works great
it also powers everything else and looks fine doing it
this power supply is unbelieveble versatile
im buying 3 more and it will work only with this
thats why i say this is the best on the world
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects
it has a terrific sound and its gorgeous
the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made
the pockets are very handy
one of the best purchases ive made for the money
i believe ive rated this instrument before
i really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it
i would buy from this company again and probally will in the future
this is an amazing guitar
i couldnt put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars
its my best acoustic currently
get it and see you will be blown away
i bought a second one
i just wish i had found this guitar sooner
cheap case but does at least fit the guitar
i like it but im just playing for entertainment and at church some times
right out of the box playable
the electronics are just fine on the guitar i got
it is a nice strap
it takes care of business just fine
but its a very good strap
perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes
this fits just right and looks just right
its well made and not too expensive
i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps
i ordered this strap to use with both my concert  tenor ukes
this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow
it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke
heres an entertaining howto video that will walk you through it
a welldesigned strap that looks and works really nice
id say its a little expensive
i looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one
its about one and a half inches wide by the way
for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal
use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though
it just does the job and im more than satisfied
it works awesome with electric guitar too
but i figured how can you go wrong
if its not good at least youre not out a lot of money
ive been thoroughly impressed with this pedal
much more sturdy than it appears in photos
works great so far and dont regret purchasing
where else can you get a greatfunctioning delay pedal for this price
this is very inexpensive and works great for my homewanna be purposes
it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc
but it definitely gives you the effect
it links well with other pedals
for my limited purposes this works great
this delay is really nice especially for the price
my favorite is this delay and the echo
my only complaint is the markings on the level knobs
they have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see
bought this for a friend
affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay
stay away from this one and get a better used pedal
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works
the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged
i love these cheap little pedals
great for around the house and rehearsal
a little noisy  but what do you expect at this price right
so far very reliable after a few months of use
the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel
it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos
in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
ive owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk
but theyve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me
one constant high pitched screeching tone
i love the sound but i wont use it live in case of feedback
that being said its still a very good pedal
i replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar
a lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar
whenever i played with traditional strings my fingertips would turn green
this corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out
therefore your strings last much longer
traditionally the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings
however this product is wonderful
for the first 3 days the strings sound strange
but after they stretch out a little they sound perfectly fine
my fingers have stopped turning green proof that the product works
i have yet to buy another set of strings
they last about twice as long
they last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular noncoated strings
i only wish id ordered the lights
i usually buy the elizir but i thought id give these a try
im sorry martin but i like the elixers the best
i would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar
so  online to see what defined state of the art
no foot pedals or expensive addons until you really have to have them
just pure creative sound that wont break the bank
the last amplifier i purchased was a fender twin valve some years ago
it is difficult to use in a small apartment  too loud
this was really a mind blowing thing
this amp is a ton of fun
it is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike
here are the reasons  solidly made everything is high quality
this is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me
i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program
i got mine in a trade for practically nothing
i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting
to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe
fender really got close with the modeling
i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii
i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly
it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box
i guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection
sadly when i tried to use them amp it didnt work
and it arrived in 4 days since i returned the first one
does its job very nicely
i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless
i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there
in summary 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service
this is really a great amp for the price
i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp
i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings
but this will more than meet your needs to use at home
buy the 20w version which is plenty loud for home
but then id go buy another one
bought this amp probably about two years ago
the 65 twin reverb on the orange level is by far my favorite
i feel like it is a bargain at any price
a great amp for practice and beginners
takes you hours to play around with all the sounds
built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage
nice and loud in a small package
for the money its a crazy deal
and this amp is so accurate that i can
above all this mustang is musical
you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy
it can it does and its cheaper than i can still believe
fender truly went to 11 on this one
the mustang 1 was a great buy for another great fender product
great little amp just not for me
i should have had more faith in fender
i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp
i cant get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe
they sound so full and strong
line 6 has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones
vox has never really made great modeling stuff
digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible
if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc
this amp is for you
but if you like to go deep youll love the fender fuse software
the value of this amp is amazing
its great just like its advertised
so if you want 24 different distortions go for it
it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings
i bought this amp along with a epi les paul 100
all i can say is wow
this is a great combination
this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects
well built and looks even better in person than the picture
plenty of power as well
going to pick up the optional foot switch
if you buy you wont be disappointed
construction  solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff
effects  there are 9 amp models ie 57 deluxe metal 2000 etc
so what are the presets
same with treble bass volume and all other effects
plug in ipod or computer with 35mm male cable
comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer
play on guitar rig and amplitude
big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel
small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc
looks like 18x18 to me
the front metallooking grill is mesh but quality and looks great
i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it
love this amp and ive shopped every comparable model
this is the one hands down worth a minimum of 150
louder than my friends 60w
d one love fender mustang you rock
great little amp but get a tube amp if youre serious about playing guitar
it will sound a lot better and its not too much more expensive
solid state just isnt the same
even then you wont get a great clean tone
its been a while since last we got together
the old amps we had were way too big
for me this one is just right
loved the fender super champ probably the best but there wasnt a headphone jack
but i did have to give up tube amp option
lets see what its got to offer for under 100
well i must say this thing rocks
but im sure something better will appear next year and until then
well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this fender amp
this little amp is amazing
the price is right and the size is right
beyond the halfway setting it wouldve hurt my ears
absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and smallevent purposes
i got this on sale from gc for 80 shipped plus 7 tax arrrgh
first and foremost this amp is amazing
all the hype and positive reviews you read are all true
the modulations and delreverbs are well done also
both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp
the tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use
printed documentation is pretty lame but the included dvd is more through
the amp gives an audiable pop when powered down
no corner protectors on this
originally putoff by the low price i went with the reviews
this amp is packed with features
beginnerintermediate level player would be very pleased
the best part is its not at all complex to learn the features
great little amp to mess around with
the various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing
for a regular venue i have an extra marshall 500watt speaker system
no pedals needed with this thing
the mustang iv is the same as the iii but with 150watts
this little amp really impressed me
controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on
but that is okay for practice and rehearsal
overall for the price it is an incredible value
get yours while you can at this price
the princeton amp emulation is sweet
my reviews for this have changed a few times but no more
go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogoogle
the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things
so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality
and i am so glad i did
i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i didnt
sorry but thats some big company b
but i realized that im a music snob
as far as amps that model vintage tones
the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp
for the tube amp snobs
nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp
this amp probably is not for you
let me make it clear
well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions
definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks
although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs
i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy
this is of course via the front panel only
im sure it can be done using the fuse editor
its supposed to be 7 lbs
heavier than the m1 but it sure doesnt feel like it
that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp
the 65 deluxe model sounds better with the 57 deluxes cab and vice versa
the 57 also seems to have more low end girth
its good for keeping things from getting too buzzy
its a very fat sounding cab sim
both the m1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my texmex pickups
i think this is understandable though
so far for 200 bucks
i couldnt ask for more
the clean tones on this are just great
the ability to modify with fuse is an additional layer of gravy
the amp is just about perfect for bedroom studio or practice
i bet more than a few of these quietly show up in nashville studios
its just ridiculous what is in this for 199
i compared this to a vox valve modeling amp not even a contest
against a spyder iv individual tastes will vary
only complaint is the stacking of the six effects onto just two knobs
but that is a minor complaint
most people dont use chorus and flange at the same time anyway
right now it is the biggest bang for the buck
oh how life changes with a baby
this little product is the perfect solution
it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package
there are two on settings  regular on and fx on
regular on is basically like a standard lead channel
turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean
crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch
nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch
fx on turns on a little delay effect
you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off
there are also knobs for volume and tone
i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug
in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale
this is my 3rd vox amplug i have purchased through amazon
they are all awesome in thier own way
if you are a satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining
i love metal rock classic rock etc
the top gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well
the satch amplug is a welcome addition to my collection
same with the metal amplug
if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure
it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it cant
still use it for practice and wont change it
its just hard to get a clean sound out of it
for those unfamiliar with voxs amplug products these things are amazing
they have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want
even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing
both of those elements are present on this signature amplug
you have a level control a gain control and a tone control
theres also three switch positions  off on and fx
the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same
i believe the lead amplug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature
again the overall tone is fantastic
while the delay is surprisingly good you cant customize it
the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some
the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion
the switches and dials may also fail over time
i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke
you might be surprised how good it sounds
the distortion was much more fizzy
took it on vacation so i didnt have to leave my axe at home
this may be 10watts but it can fill a big room with its sound
not too heavy and very handy for traveling
built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient
this little dude weighs next to almost nothing
it does however sound amazing
its clean bright and loud
for metal its got great control of the distortion tone which sounds pretty good
a good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control
it came extremely well packed
for the price this is one great little dynamo
great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house
compact size makes storage easy
rogue g10 10w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing
actually its loud enoucht for home
the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it
a nice little amp to rock out with
i have not used it yet so i cant say much
however i have loaded the software on my laptop
the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling
very good deal for newbies like me
got to me in two days
and its a great midi controller
i hope if yall get one
that said i purchased this for my home recording studio
the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys
i love the fact that this controller has full size keys
could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box
then it had some stuck notes
then it stopped being recognized at all
it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound
the jack was visibly wiggly too
with drum pads i basically either get 0 velocity or max
and i have to really hammer on them to trigger
likes  size assignable knobs
works good w ableton livedislikes  drum pads
keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size
im looking to upgrade after a month
works as advertised but the keys are stiff
pads take too much presure to activate
nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop
you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response
the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable
hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last
for this price it is a do not recommend for me
dont get this if you have man hands
i have it custom mapped for multiple softwares
i love the product and all the features for the price
when unplugging it just be careful and itll last a lot longer
the price on amazon is awesome
i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band
plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately
i researched a ton before i bought this one
touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys
this is a really amazing portable midi keyboard
