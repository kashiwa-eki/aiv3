super fast shiiping  through amazon as always
this shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick
fantastic product that every guitar player needs  period
i have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio
you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows 7
so much for magic elixir tone
i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele
this is a great effect
i keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times
clean the effect is a little weak
its about one and a half inches wide by the way
based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller
it works well for all of them and is inexpensive
simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors
quick snap on and off
i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations
so these are heavy strings that work well
should come in different sizes
this acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever
gonna have to send this back
these strings speak with a bolddefined and powerful voice
this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops
it doesnt snap in place
the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however
the replacement amp exhibited the same problems
it does jusy exactly whats expected
i am definitely proud of this product
theres not much to say about this product except that it works
after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was
a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar
i didnt notice any difference to the feel of the string
theres no such thing as a best string
in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact
it is user friendly and guitar friendly
attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system
so things just roll around inside case
for the price its a really good deal
thats how much of a difference these strings make
its almost like picking with with just your fingers except with more volume
if you need a tuner this ones a good one
i would say it muffles too much though
i am amazed at the great sn8
these cords strike that balance perfectly
ive never had these before until recently
i would recommend it to others to try
wide sweeping flange effect great harmonics and little power useage
the 2i2 is a simple setup
every note will have the same volume
ive used daddario strings for years and they never fail me
should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz
to me thats a perfect combo
i bought this strap for a esp ec1000 les paul style guitar
what the crap are they talking about
the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep
this little tuner is excellent
and folds up in to a small package
theres no real benefit to these strings
these strings arent anything fancy but they sound great
i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii
nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends
its really the durability that sets these apart
its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it
this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed
definitely provided extra gripping surface
the xlr male  the xlr female are well built
cant ask for more than that
besides who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works
the amp modelling is fantastic
i prefer the cactus picks
been playing for five decades now
not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer
im going to buy a couple more as gifts
i did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size
the price was just right cam quickly and id buy them again
great for around the house and rehearsal
after checking each string multiple times
i got 2 of these for my electric guitars
even so it was a good quality button
we never have problems with our monster gold cables
this is handsdown the best tuner ive ever owned
for practice and the home studio it is great
this however is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot
my advice  dont even install the app from the included disc
however the hot tubes completely transforms that tone
covers all strings and depresses them fully
the snark sn8 is far superior
for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth  lol
ive been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011
you just dont get better service than this company provides
i really expected better quality for 3500 after such light use
and when you are ready to wail just turn up your guitar volume
this is built like a tank and should last a lifetime
i purchased as a practice amp
youtube videoed how to do it
all the capos ive had from kyser are still in great conditions
fits a standard xstand just fine and makes a very secure connection
it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on
as for this joyo i cant complain
not that a guitar should ever be considered clutter
but its held together fine so far and ive had it for weeks
goodsounding and playing allaround strings
this is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner
i am very happy with it
73 mm picks  i would consider them medium thickness
im a semipro player and this tuner is all i need
start to feel scratchy this is a quick fix until youre ready to restring
so i hope that helps
and the adapters never used em
i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay
i used to be able to deal with it
i have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords
you need to do that with the speaker switch
this was like 35 and sounds awesome
i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon
works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas
again someone will chime in and bash me for saying this
it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have
a plastic bag does fine
i have a marshall amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers
it is exactly what it says it is and works fine
my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny
the material used is fine
as expected for a beginner
the balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems
in fact it likely even adds bass to your sound
for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet
you cant beat the price
i have seen people complain about battery life
string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad
but it works well and the batteries seem to last
its not a big deal
now this guitar is a joy to play
supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar
ive only been using the yellow one so far only just started using them
i cant imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself
however i would not change out a working 3way switch for this
tried these on a whim
no problems with seller and product came quick
nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box
does the british sound succeed at that goal
for the price this pedal is a good deal though
finally settling on this cherry burst lp100
well father than it looks like it would in the pics
for the price it cant really be beat
the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent
it does what it is supposed to
i used this with drums
its one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product
the tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar
once i figured out how to set it up
it does a fine job
i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue
item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set
we all know its just a container with a sponge in it no biggie
havent had any problems with it at all so far
but this is a keyboard not an organ
my favorite brand of strings right now
what more can i say
other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine
just ups the value even further
meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee
but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk
you can get these in 24 packs at
i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone
this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price
if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls
super tight and very accurate
all guitar stores display their guitars with them
if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam
cant speak to durability because havent had them long and havent used them heavily
perfect fit for medium picks
a third button for reverb would have been amazing
some guitarists will love these
in all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick
i shouldve just got this cable the first time
i have lots of friends who play these strings
true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo
2 put a preamp on this
this stand really is pretty tough
the ds1 usually hurts my ears but with the cm2 behind it sweet
the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box
solid attachment to bass drum
that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip
unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin
you can spend hours finding 34your sound34 or just 34the sound34 that you need
i was expecting a soso mike for the price boy was i surprised
i keep one in each case
i love em use them daily and rely on them
have you heard good 70s recordings
i have never been let down by ernie ball strings
not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine
ive used it for 8 months with no issues at all
it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping
but at this time i am not sure i like what i have done
this thing was over a hundred dollars
works with multiple straps as well
it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too
i gave it 4 stars on just expectation
they have become my favorite phones
notice in the name guitar input
the hardware is decent but i wouldnt expect the hinges to last forever
i bought a washburn rx40 with duncan usm
easy to build and breaksdown for transport
ive used three with no trouble
comfortable and easy to adjust for length
i think this tube basically brought the volume down
dont know why i didnt buy this years ago
the strap is comfortable and adjustable
easy affordable fast why go out
he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there
only negative check bc the ends are too bulky
the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to
i did the same with these 3 sets
053 strings in both phosphor bronze and 8020 bronze
this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more
louder than my friends 60w
theyre great for quick movement around the fret board
its not a highend 200 pro stand
the board i received came supplied with plenty of softsided velcro
these help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board
i sent it back probably due to my ignorance
no fret noise or hums
the winder is a little awkward to use
stores 99 loops doubt id ever in my lifetime need that many
its a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment
this is a very good cable
ive seen more expensive cables and this one is so far great
this product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately
kinda cool if you ask me
perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily
the mic looks good but has almost no mass
what more can you ask for out of a drink holder
this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great
my friend left a thin pick and i tried it
just check out my review video for the blue pop
good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this
these work great and look sweet too
cant go wrong with this one
its cheap its basic and it works
quality and price im just satisfied
goes through 9v batteries quickly so stock up
if you want a strap for 5 you cant expect the moon
the behringer cs400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor
i mean  the range rate arent as broad as others ive tried
i would recommend this to anyone
my other favorite is a dean electric 12 string
and it just looks better without it
i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick
i burn through one or two cm100l per semester
this pedal has an extremely high output
its definitely a great value
of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably wont care
this handles bass tuning much better
used this for more than a year and finally sold it
a very attractive and well constructed strap
great strings at a great price
works great for blues rock a little stoner country and even some metal
good product for practice or recording
overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul
and the result sounds really right
this set is no exception
if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more
might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers
what does this add to the others
very stable and they make tuning a joy
my studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs
good sound and the feel is good
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
it is a nice strap
but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell
these hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs
ive had this for almost a year
they are inexpensive and sound great
this is a decent buy below the two dollar level
i found running leads  scales with this pick to be a delight
for a soft bag this offers all i would ever need
good tone but dicey controls
this is the best usb condenser mic ive ever used
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
i work with a guy who has played guitar for 30 years
if you are stop doing it
its a well build daisy chain dc power cable
not much but a little
once you8217ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play
i messed with it for about 5 minutes
no nasty residue build up over time
ive been looking for 34the34 portable amp for some time
i highly recommend this guitar
long lasting and great tone besides
i bought this during the black friday sale
the volume knobs are handy for sure
it is still in great condition
flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action
clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect
they did nothing to help my overbraced 1970 gibson j50 though
just the design man go planet waves
overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
so i dunno what that other guy was complaining about
to my computer for mixing duties in reaper
oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixirs
the drivers gave me no hassle installing and as i said above rock solid
i didnt have near as much string stretch with these either
the other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear
i didnt notice much of a change tonally
i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one
works and it is good
they are much better then the original strings
i have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base
but then i needed a reverb pedal
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp
that comes with a solid extension arm
reliable last a while and more important theyre inexpensive
back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo
great sound that only a bone nut can produce
and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit
better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me
low action and stays in tune for days
it does make the strap long but is suppose to
you cant really do that with this pedal
only thing keeping it from 5 stars
for a long time i never thought much about guitar strings
they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are
i simply dont see any reason to switch atm
you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours
also considering the lunchbox extension cab
he was happy with the cradle guitar stand
these are great xlr cables
do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal
its cheap and it works as advertised
this is a really nice microphone
great portability for the price
too bad as i had high hopes
i hear its good for vocals as well
my fingers get sore when playing
i wasnt expecting much from the mic
and the price is right
ive had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone
its one of the hest fuzz pedals ever
whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa
it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable
not to bulky and the right angle plugs save space
this is what the black ice delivers
snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly
i ended up returning the whole shooting match
look up mxr phase 90 mods and eriks corner will show you how
also this thing is huge for the back of the neck
traditionally the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings
this filled the bill works on basically any type of guitar
powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc
i have a 13 gooseneck a light condenser mic and small shockmount on it
ill never use another string on acoustics
its a 20 amp it does what it has to and does it well
i highly recommend them especially the ones with the builtin vibration sensor
samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website
i get about a month of playing from those strings
the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder
this pedal is great help on stage
they make another version which is less pointy
next i proceeded to adjust the intonation
theyre noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummylike
if you buy this you really need to baby it
ill be ordering from musicians friend again
i tested it with other tuners and its right on
the ability to modify with fuse is an additional layer of gravy
i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option
i have a blue voodoo all tube amp
i ordered these for my husband the guitar player
s display to be more than sufficient
nice volume coming out of it also for 75 watts it seems more
they are good quality screws
about 2 weeks later i had a new cable
it has great tone and sustain wonderful harmonics
i had to get used to this tuner at first
couldnt ask for more in a momentary switch
the celluloid ones come two per size
and manipulate the external controls as needed
it really will produce marshall plexi tones
fwiw i like my snarks better
these fit that requirement well
the flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal
the truss rod was completely loose
it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well
these are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer
sounds simple but youll see
i always thought i was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned
this multiplug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals
the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension
dont waste your money on this junk
but it has the star for grip and that is super
for my needs this one works
or if you like both equally
i use it with reaper
not as bright as i would like them however very nice
how can you beat that
the sound is lets say
very fast readout and fast on off
i kinda demands output to another devicemixeramp if you want to play loud
this produces a much less bright more muted sound
save your money and get some harps that actually work
on the mandy absolutely no problems
these strings do not last less time than the elixirs
the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore
it works got on time
very nice resonant and clean
for the price you really cant go wrong with this guitar stand
of the three the phase 90 has the least versatility
i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake
im not especially particular but do like good sound
i know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally
celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i dont
see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool
this is a great guitar for the money
other then that it works just like it says it will
i havent heard a hint of feedback and the onoff switch is a plus
even thoigh they work on many brands
lightweight small simple to use and its easy to read in broad daylight
i got this to use with my 12 string
this champ is made for one thing
none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall which is good right
to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip
for 15 you cant beat this
adjustments for intensity and length
then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me
i leave it plugged in on the board all the time
what makes a good cable
bwoosh loop  no tingting
grips really well in your hand plays like a dream
its also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing
it is not road worthy however in our opinion
i swear by these quick release clips
that helps you understand a lot
i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic
its for studio not live performances
i did not know that these cables actually made a difference
on top of it all its pretty affordable
its great to have sustain again on my keyboard again
i bought this just to see what everyone was raving about
it sounds awesome and is built like a tank
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam
there is one area where the pig prevails
well i need to correct this
it wont budge once you clip it and its low profile
it works amazing and saves plenty of time
i know daddario loves the color coded ends
i still love the pwma230 but i am no fan of its manufacturer
i imagine it would hold beer too
highly recommend anything by d addario
also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing
purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings
it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make
unfortunately my extralong fingers find this very difficult to play
ive tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best
more profit in someones pocket for marketing jargon
reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record
i wrote to line6 and i got useless answers about
i enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars
arrived as expected very solid great fit
this is a winwin buying decision as far as i am concerned
i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new
these are the best tuners for the money
it saves time when restringing a guitar
the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom
needs little space another plus
this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price
very handy for making it all just right
when i got it in it didnt work
it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug
this music stand is og great quality and of a great price
though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby
the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy
again light went out and back to the original
visually they dont appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings
i will need to look for something else
it is ok definitely not great
its not great but should work as a quiet practice amp
just dont use this for guitars
they figure a guitar that cheap cant be much good
only slightly better than 05
for the money its really hard to beat
whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear
i love the colors and the matte finish too
but ive never played a set of this brand that i didnt like
thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars
you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case
ill use nothing but snarks
went to a local music store heard and was sold
the bag is well made considering its price
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now
i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music
really you hate warm sustaining naturaltube overdrive you wont like it at all
seems like it draws current even when its off
it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles
easy to read easy to use
did not hold the strings down very well for me
for a while i had the sn5 tuner
these were just what i needed
im starting to lean towards the tortex
the chromacast also has many more pockets
you will be far far happier
i dont ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are
and i saved about 70 or 80 bucks
and inside that was my lovely new guitar
it doesnt have a strap button at the top end
again its a clipon tuner so dont expect razorsharp accuracy
i didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is
practical useful for drum kit
ive been using them for years and they work amazingly
it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability
this is a super easy to use pedal
and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone
however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip
for the price and product quality you cant go wrong with this one
which is why im buying another half dozen
i bought the wrong gauge
the rest is just great
i mean these are cables
i have at least 5 of these
the only negative is the way they seem to be packed here
i love these microphones i really do
the best part is its not at all complex to learn the features
the construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts
and the price is right
these guys are rocksolid and really easy to install
this is a great microphone
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build
consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand
cool design makes a big difference in you audio
these cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp
they will last and last and last and give you great sound
it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths
cool pedal on a clean amp
that frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff
but it does the job and its well made
this is the best delay i have tried thus far
to my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum
works well for my guitar
these are what they need to be
this powers the system without hooking it into the usb system of your computer
at the price it sells for i consider it a bargain
its simple well made and works great
outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with hossen
switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly
it works different than an eq
but it was what i was looking for
i cant say i love them or i hate them
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
its easy to install very tough and i love how it looks
the only problem is the size
the ab switch is kinda a nice touch
i have to admit this up front  im a terrible bass player
i got this to plug into my computer
only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars
i cant speak to the string life
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
its not necessarily a bad different its just slicker and not as coiled feeling
tonewise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which i rather like
im pleased with the digitaltoanalog conversion
it comes with clips that can be used for other tablets
this made actuating it a less natural motion
the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing
you may see it differently
love it love it love it
i dont know if its just mine or is something inherent in this pedal
their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order
i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses
i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me
this is an absolutely wonderful recorder
unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights
this is an exemplary capo
prosportability easy of use and set up
my young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one
is working very good 100 satisfaction
best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp
i keep one in each guitar case
this stands up and holds the microphone in place
remember this is overdrive  not distortion
ive banged mine around a bit and its stayed in one piece
this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier
i just got it today
and why do these cost so much more anyhow
downloading is quick and easy
all in all a good but not 34perfect34 stand
i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila
the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks
new to guitars but in 24hrs
dont see how they even afford to make these things for this price
i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good
i dont have any tone loss between these and
i also wish that this specific came in another color other than black
first saw on youtube video how genius
i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself
its a value at full price also
already ordered a different one to replace it
great for a quick look in between songs
that would not make it a deal breaker
affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingcons  this model is one compartment
the sn1 settles quickly and works with a wide array of instruments
i love these picks for playing my acoustic
this seems like a good product
it also comes with a nice polishing cloth
the shape is cool but id feel safer with it in a metal casing
the sound is a lot more there
the strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets
i immediately noticed a difference in the warmth articulation and fullness of my sound
it had been dropped on its head
not my first intellitouch tuner
these are good but different
this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop
sometimes the simplest design is the best design
but like i said it good for the price
not exactly what i wanted
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs
maybe its a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric
i dont think i would take it on an airline
so theyre good sounding strings and they last a long time
it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals
to me they just sound complete
senneheisers evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look
i bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good
i doubt i will lose them
little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bit
these picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction
who says you cant afford the good stuff these days
the title pretty much says it all
10 picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company
i have two of these for my acoustics and when i get another acoustic
try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star
overall i would buy again
i will still use a strap lock
i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited
on that scale these strings would be above a literal medium
between the 1st and 5th fret i dont really need adjust
however i believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine
this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be
some people complain about the smell
it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well
if i change my mind about anything i will update my review
they are an excellent value
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool
they add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk
if bon scott only knew
my stereo image even feels wider now
i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me
i have been trying different ones
bought it after read reviews
i can see a few years of careful use
and the sound expanded beyond my expectations
its got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug
not a drop in replacment for many fenders
i just needed this for my new guitar
most real studio preamps are a good match for it
i got this item much quicker than i expected
again 8020s are recommended for mahogany guitars
my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case
in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
cant wait to get it and i will review it also
compression smooths over these problems and levels everything to a polished presentable sound
i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there
another item never received but i would not use anything over
this inexpensive delay is very special
speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice
fast delivery and exactly as advertised
ill prob use it with my upgrade
the pdc21 is a nofrills device
if you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle
construction  solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff
hey it does its job for a cheap price
yes the battery is difficult to replace
strings are not just strings
id give it 4 stars
if the knob ever breaks they are a very easy replacement at radio shack
its just a matter of attention to detail
my son loves this polishcleaner
have recommended to several students
this pickup sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically
dont upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level
cant go wrong for the price
does a good job for a basic delay
both the m1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my texmex pickups
this case solves that problem
ive never owned one before this
plus it is extremely low priced
it was to be shipped from japan
at this price why not
it began to tear on my guitar strings
they sound more mellow and not as bold
havent used enough to see if images wear well
foam padded everywhere guitar touches
installed as usual and tuned them
kind of somewhere in between
inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge
i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc
its pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig
its got a nice look too
some of the drives are usable
it really is versatile as well as noiseless
if you are a beatle fan this is such a cute item
i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer
great purchase especially if bought used
i bought two of these
if it doesnt work you hate it
simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings
ive read that folks prefer the kk over the madeforthegsminitaylorpickup
the best few bucks youll spend on guitar care
it just feels a little tight and crammed when i wear it
for the lower price you get black plastic
i highly recommend this product
i have never had it go out of tune while playing even when stringbending
on the other side you cant use boost channel without drive channel
the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob
it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on
ive been through my john pearse phase
i use alot of the other ones as well
this is one pedal that will stay on my board
i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal
recreates spring reverb very accurately
ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
that may change along the way
here are my itemized observations  first three sets for 13 currently
what more do you want
sooo i figured why not have a go at it
the pitch black is nice and bold and bright
this a solid performing unit at this price point
it also is feature loaded but with one kicker
much more grainy and tiny but that may be a plus for you
phosphor bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars imho
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music
from there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as
of course hohner has been around longer than me
i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this
its poorly made with attention to detail
you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner
you will not regret this purchase
i guess there was some mild crud buildup you cant see
easy to put together and holds my guitar very well
subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what id been searching for
thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of five
it may tend to overdrive a little bit
will this replace a pro fret job
straight from the case these dont bend well but do not despair
this is what i have needed for many years
not a lot of moving parts on this piece
i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the gs specs
the tailpiece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing
i usually use dunlop big stubby 20 picks
the only problem i have is it smells terrible
it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel  correctly
the mixer arrived early which was a lifesaver
i noticed immediate result after applying first time
i will probably always use these
we had a birthday jam at a friends house
i trust the planet waves brand
the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable
i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me
fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar
my experience with the tungsol tubes was very very negative
these dunlops get it just right
these are a new style of guitar pick to me
i dont use it for any heavy use
i replaced the strings right away
theres lots of gain available
ive got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years
i absolutely love it and im glad that the aluminum ones are durable
if you need more than this i dont know what to tell ya
this is the first one ive bought that had the smaller transducers
some users report quality issues here  i guess time will tell on that
its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark
im not hot about their acoustic but electric
anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole
the other unit seems to be rock solid
fit perfect to my taylor t5 and no cons i can find so far
this pedal got it 100 right with tone after a tube switch
i usually buy locally but the deal here was great
ill get this one again
do yourself a favor and avoid them
behringer has never been very documentation oriented
individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth
but i guess you cant have it all
im happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price
what is it they say in this era  caveat emptor
effects loop is on the front
it is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use
it uses a normal 9v adapter jack thank you finally
bought a couple of these to build preloaded pickguards for strats
i dont think its true bypass either
if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note
they will require that i drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly
this makes the process so much easier
i was getting hum from some of my cheaper cables
it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap
give good crisp and live sound to my acoustic guitar
i am very satisfied with these cords and would highly recommend them
edit  the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle
as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal
i taught her the cchord and i play the gchord
alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flatpick drag
this unit is well constructed
its usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues
the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand
thank god for the website that had this on a blog
i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n
feels and looks good right out of the box
out of most ive tried ive come across the big muff the most
again maybe not 750 good but at least 250300 good
stopped working all by itself
i like the martin coated as well but i prefer the elixer
i would highly recommend this and give it a nobrainer 5 star rating
from playing and singing piano recording guitar and vocals and other various positions
think peavey 6505 eq structure
the thing is they get to be a bit overwhelming at least to me
this item was purchased because im doing selfteaching on the fiddle
addendum 12132011if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection
i dont hold it against the pedal though
im glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them
i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock
they also work well with acoustical guitar
well those reviewers were right  the pitch correction function has no effect
i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier
drs last three times as long as daddario
i tried it on bass and was really impressed
came in perfect working condition
it is exactly what you need in a capo
i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way
its very sturdy and well built
it was the right price for me right now
you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound
ill stick with what i know well
great little piece of leather
high quality does not fray stays on the guitar
however there is one problem ive had with it
i love these little guys
34 and it certainly did
but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip
it gets abused so i dont look for it to last long
looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well
i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together
you need monitors or quality headphones
better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen
if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is
i always end up using a little fender portable stand
they were direct drop ins
i like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well
this is a very useful product at a fair price
they are just the most wonderful picks ive used
the 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff
is it a completely authentic acoustic sound
it came in nice packaging
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived
but that goes for all neck racks really
not so with the spider iv
bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer
i dont feel i am missing anything compared to the medium
i bought one then i bought two more then i bought two more
this little tuner is sweet
i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it
the rubber grip area is great
the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone
but they will not screw down all the way and are losse
have used them for years
it does everything the product description tells you about
ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors
add 34apogee one mic mount34
its expensive for a joyo but cheap for a really good od stomp
these strings sound full and warm on the instrument
i gigged with it for years without issue
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around
you simply attach the dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar
it is also a great value for what it does
overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavyduty
i highly recommend this product
i bought this to tote my pod hd500 around
after couple of weeks i also noticed some volume variations as i played
i have found that this model fits my needs perfectly
tone control didnt work so it was returned
i got this for my wireless mics but they dont fit in this holder
the generic ones installed were from 2010
ive been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding
go with the planet waves lock straps
the dura picks have more variety theres only one in each thickness
got what i paid for
live and in the studio these strings work for everything
epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier
first off the shipping was fantastic
you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank
battery is included also so you can use it right out the box
basically i use this for everything except winding strings
i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer 6pedal board
the seller did not fail me in any way
this tape will definitely fill the requirement
a very good pedal that you miss only when its off
zero hum or buzz from the unit
just love this little amp
i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material
i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly
this was the first time i ventured into the world of harp
my current one i bought in july and so far everything is holding up
the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar
so how do they sound
i do like the built in pick holder
you lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning
meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units
you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it
it was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it
before supply and demand kicks in
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
i wouldnt take it on a tour or anything it is plastic
if these dont work for you you can always buy the vpick
the cutter worked great too
all the finish is excellent
crystal clear and it doesnt color the recordings
gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot
its not gucci but doesnt feel like plastic either
there is a metronome function which i havent used
and as for the winder
planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff
if you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well
i may need new cables
some may disagree but im convinced
there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box
so i ordered 6 more packs of these
the vox model is also really jangly sounding  like its supposed to
the prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument
i also own bose quiet comfort 15s and ae2s and the grado s80is
theres some element of nostalgia with the ds1 that ive just never understood
instead i got a decent set of
sounds great for my telecaster and my stratocaster guitars
i have written other reviews about elixir
it works very well on a pedalboard
moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool
with this pedal its easy
good height adjustment for sitting or standing
right at the upper lip works well for me
get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar
and it is fender licensed
will buy more when needed
it is lightweight but is still sturdy
oh well i got stuck with two microphones without onoff switch
looks better than the expansive one my grandson has
it aired in a few minutes
just buy it and move on
they clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced
hey i got this and an ovation idea from godps
this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319
ive had to change a few batteries but they last a long time
and what to do if one does fail
i cant see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all
chrome is great quality and it has good weight so its not tinny
amazon was great in conjunction with the seller
pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit
they are instead control picks
i have several and a snark for each one
the design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on
if you use an ac adapter get a hum eliminator
these cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the usa
i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products
i plugged the guitar to my old crate amp and it sounded pretty good
the y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a stratocaster
it works great on both
i have played full time for over 27 years
but once its on it works
the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable
its easy to put on and holds the strings well
the most recent one i purchased was not this one
it is bigger than i had imaginedits almost the length of an iphone
its still in my primary set up
and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner ive ever used
the build quality is fantastic
amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students
took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron which recognized it immediately
this is much better than the other brand i have
my amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style
these and reds are my favorite acoustic strings
overall i like these picks a lot
the fulltone full drive 2 is another incarnation of the original fulldrive
it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned
this is as good as other devices that cost 34 times more
it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component
the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced
the jig method is super easy and provided great results
this is a nice part
id recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a builtin tuner
beautiful sound and very well made
but since i solved that problem with the honing stone i was more curious
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly
im not ashamed of having chinese clones on my board
the arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching
im glad i bought it and would buy from the company again
i highly recommend this cable
i especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner
if you need to polish your guitar look no further
let me start by saying
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
its solidly built and i dont imagine it will break easily
im really glad i found this stuff
will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had
it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional
i am not a fussy person about guitar strings
its got knobs and buttons
strings are half the battle with stringed instruments
it feels well constructed like it wont break if i drop it
holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation
this gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique
i am amazed by this amp
beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck
i bought this for a friend whos previous tuner was lost
if youre looking for a budget increase of tone
the instructions describe 16 sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor
what else could you want in a guitar strap
ive always used ernie ball strings
i bought this guitar humidifier for my taylor
ive got at least 6 spares at home right now
try the light if you are a beginner
no more hiss no more static
but it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones
this model is a keeper to be sure
i took a chance and got this one and it was a good call
very comfortable and looks great too
much better than the more economical ones sold
the evans pedal patch will work for you great
im glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup
plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper
why is it even there
save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this
i see other reviewers having issues
the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above
the velcro itself is insanely amazing
it works for a metallica pantera type sound
i even recently bought a 2nd just because
good breadth of tonal variations available
i got this for my line6 pocket pod
the characteristic strat sound of my guitar is very apparent
this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound
i replaced the factory strings with these
if you are a satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining
best mic in this price range by far
small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc
but the sound is awesome
for the money this thing sounds just fine
even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over
no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric archtop
it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board
as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same
i dont like them at all
better than i imagined even with all the good reviews
this is what it is
good quality for the price its a mic on a stand
25 whereas the same string in the exl111 set is
i found the tongsol to give me the best tone over all
the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs
i take care of my stuff
i highly recommend this guitar stand
buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string b3
three knobs to control tone level and distortion to get that perfect sound
its pretty enough and fine for a 100 guitar
i also put a pop filter on it
and the tascam th02 keeps up
the amplifier use three tubes  1x 12ax7 and 2x 6v6s
the variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects
but i think the electroharmonix tubes sound better therefore they do
on average it eats a battery a day
the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately
beyond great tone  playability these suckers are reliable as all getout
ive been playing for 8 years and i own 4 electric guitars
the chrome on the sides looks very cool
exactly what i was looking for
other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle
very responsive and never dull or weak sounding
gotta love those new external usb power nodes
they are very flexible easy to handle and of good quality
i will try to get a replacement
i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only
just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice
great foot switch that is easy to use
will get aother one for 2nd guitar
for lt 75 shipped i certainly cant complain
i only play elixir strings
i purchased some others to try
i ordered two just in case
it also appears that the tuner wasnt reliable on the pitch end either
this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1 so it buzzes longer
i keep hoping ill find something it does work well with
i have purchased six so far
for under twenty dollars this pylepro mike cant be beat
just changed strings on my epi les paul and this windercutter performed flawlessly
its incredibly easy to use and very handy when restringing a guitar
ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion
and it sounds just as good as major brands
they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though
i love this now i dont have to find my pick
getting used to the attachment
i like the sound they provide and the price is nice
they do take some time getting used to
i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake
tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank
tension is perfect for my washburns
the holes work with my strap buttons okay
i just got these to collect not to use to play with
if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though
i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle  nice
the product itself is excellent
im very happy when i got this gig bag
i decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings
luckily one of the band members had another one
i bought this to replace a behringer uca202
so this one works well for the price
we bought this tester for our son to use for his bands equipment setup
i use it on all my condenser mics
its getting the job done and i havent seen a better option
im very happy with the size of the sn1
it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well
this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it
in summary daddario makes good strings and these are no exception
my piece arrived in a week thank you very much
because from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose
a definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick
does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do
that would have been perfect
its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie
i find it stays in tune like a 34instrument34 should now
i was a little disappointed
the monitor is powered so theres a power cable as well
the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals
i will have to use an acoustic preamp
i have had some last a few years
if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it
my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item
its about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability
raising it is a different story though
it was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront
or so maybe more if you keep them lower down
very heavy cord and top quality construction
everything should be this easy to use and work this well
the latter offers the now popular xz mic configuration but theyre fixed mics
the snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything ive ever seen
ive got to be missing something here
then i went to daddario strings
the good  8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time
both mac and windows are supported
but thats way too much amp for me at this time
its very rare thing to see now a days
its built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand
i have ordered several of these  like 6 or 7
martin is at the top of the heap
i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone
for 40 its an awesome deal
it works nicely and for the price it was a steal
have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar
the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone
easy to use easy to see
there is a reason they are used by so many professionals
it works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people
you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects
this cable is very well constructed
ive done it  it sucked
seriously are you a child
except for that time i couldnt find it
at the sale price of 119 this cant be beat
this are a great value for your buck
the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff
shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner
this is a great buy under 100
i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around
dont buy the one from the store this is cheaper
five stars for what it does at this price
it is very snug on the strings
the external power brick for this guy seems fragile
this will allow me to show off and protect them
for a modest rig or on the road use i recommend this product
the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find
i wont waste money on the more expensive cables again
this isnt 1960 get an upgrade already
if i need more ill probably buy this again
all the proline shure mics are top quality
i didnt run it without this power source that seems too ghetto
sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement
i bought this strap for my luna 12 string
i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input
what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss
would buy again should the need arise
i wrote the company described the problem
one spots come with an 8pedal multi plug
luckily i had extra and this didnt bother me that much
make a note it is not a metal pedal
quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence
if youve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one
loved the fender super champ probably the best but there wasnt a headphone jack
just didnt have the tone and bite i was expecting
fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar
upon comparing the resulting  cds
this pedal is very easy to use
i use delay pretty light n tight  slapback vibe not too wet
for the money i dont think it can be beat
80 but i still like the tortex picks for that as well
im building a speaker cab with a jensen 6 speaker just for this amp
this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie
i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike
i have been using audacity which is a free download
although it does exactly what it says
fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out
what do they call medium or small
i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother
dont let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you
really nice looking and heavy duty
overall its a solid cable for practice
i have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes
i tried this at the store
i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc
they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most
it worked very well on violin too
the lubricating feature is just a nice plus
i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more
cant beat it for the price
i made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress
i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job
i also purchased the ac adaptor since these things typically eat batteries
nevertheless the sound is quite good
good sustain and strings are staying in tune well
if you need a tube screamer
conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically
the pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also
theyre durable and have a long battery life
maybe thats just a matter of taste but otherwise this is a great stand
the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable
it is definitely better for thicker strings
always looking for reasonable pricing
they must stay in our universe
they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china
easy to assemble and feels very solid
the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
i believe i have been wishing for this for years
still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old
it is very hard to accurately cut the strings
then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and youre ready to go
amazing clarity and worth the 28 and change
which means it does what it was designed to do
i would recommend these they look great
replenished my dried out fretboard to likenew condition
its quite the perfect height for when im seated on my stool
they dont vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they dont need as much clearance
this pedal is solidly built and works as advertised
this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing
ill get another cr if this one holds up okay
they dont do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do
on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits
decent quality ends and build
i cant comment on how long theyll last or keep in tune
it sounds like a cheap mic
yet it is a capo structured very well
one final note about behringer
this board is great no sliders which i had to clean
this is a good quality strap
highly recommended for confort and durability
not completely gone but lessened
good price and works well
just sitting on two other speakers
have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time
you dont plan to adjust it much and3
the mark tremonti wah is great
this 12 pack was about the same price as 23 packs of elixirs
tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard
i wish it were brighter and easier to see
the nanoweb coating is nice
this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish
different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above
my 1981 lucille did love these strings
but didnt have the cash for another at4033 or similar
and the price is great
if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another
people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo
but there was one thing wrong
consider taking my advice  treat yourself
if you are looking for a regularmedium string these are real nice
it seems to hold tight
they were a perfect fit
when it comes to quality of cables im really not to picky about it
to your weekly moving equipment caravan
i have found the perfect strings and these are not them
the process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time
not on my newer sg thoughat least with the new screws it comes with
so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar
ive learned the hard way that there are some things you dont skimp on
i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks
i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it
i bought this specifically for a gt100
the best sound i got was on my strat
all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly
when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully
only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds
05034 found on gibons and espltds
i would not recommend it
good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner
sound nice but very unreliable bx5a deluxe
very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick
hi i need this item for travelling and it has work very well
i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program
if it were under 7 it would have gotten 5 stars
i am using a vintage garrard turntable
that is just unbelievable in my eyes
bottom line it extends the life of my strings and thats always good
the quality of the nickel is very good too
it is a range of literally hundreds  perhaps even thousands of specific tones
i bought this not for the tuner but because i needed a metronome
this one is very good long lasting guitar strings
just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts
i also tested it with audacity in recording my voice
pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did
wow a bench that really holds my ass
i thought light would be the better route but now im not sure
for this much i have no complaints
soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue  muffled audio recording
its perfect for vocals podcasting video recording and so forth
he found exactly what his guitar needed and at a good price
you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish
then tell me what you think grin
i have them in chrome in every guitar i own
its not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock
well made tube with good amount of gain and highs
i like the build and design
i paid only 29 and it is small and convenient
okay so here is how i put it to the test
you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box
its very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over
no pedal including a 200 boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies
if you get these and they arent perfect
this one was hard to read
this is a pick holder
you can plug it into the pc and customize everything
if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars
ive used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments
its inexpensive and easy to use
i would purchase this again
this is not the case with the hd 500
for the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose
in my opinion the ypg235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck
its too stiff not comfortable at all
its truly a one of a kind product
plenty of power as well
i am liking these more and more as time goes by
but thats not a problem any more
the difference is that 160 can be modified by the user or left asis
this pedal has a cool 1950s style  appearance
they look play and sound great
though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own
it really has its own tone i must add
if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be 5star strings
there is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the onoff switch
the tone control alters the basstreble mix but not very significantly in my opinion
dont leave home without it
id buy these again in a heart beat
i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc
in addition this one has a metronome
although the cloth i got was black and not yellow just pointing that out
eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should
but this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls
i use this one spot adapter with the 5 pedal attachment
at least thats what it says on his website
thank you ernie ball for making far superior strings
i got three single channels and two dual channel units
i would buy them again
the line 6 spider iv 75watt combo was the perfect solution
for 22 bucks cant really go wrong
the same company makes a tuning capo which i find handy at times
totally perfect for holding my guitar
the fender vibro champ is a great little amp
ok theyre a little odd but for the price i dealt with it
they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune
this works fine on a standard guitar
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
also it may be a litle larger than some like
nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat
its a good banjo capo
sounds good and has great intonation
would recommend these for folks on a budget
great for carrying with you
well its a solid chunk of metal
its hard to call it any particualr sound
lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound
good item for the price
its a simple cable what can be said
does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply
when i opened the box was surprised as i didnt notice the usb cable
the truebypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged
although im not onstage bouncing aroung
this is the first delay that ive owned and im not looking back
it comes with a cord that has a standard 14 inch end
the build quality is top notch
steel will wear down your frets a lot faster
this works just as good as anything else
the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig
it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with
most of the band members dont mind them
not so hard on the fingers
ive long been partial to daddario stringsi dont have a guitar without them
i have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench
there is however no mounting point  no captive nuts or such
i cant really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings
like the option of nc or no
i actually had to send the first one back because it did not work
seems like theyll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us
and these headphones fit well
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
however for other people the sm58 works better
as the protector ages it slips off the end
from extra slinky to heavy gauge jazz strings  you just cant go wrong
that said this thing is rock solid
i dont know much about delay and ive never really used it
i may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic
it does what it is intended to do holds my picks
34 yes you might think so until you plug it in
the hardware is what you would expect from a yamaha product
i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles
let me start by saying im always on the quest for great amazing tone
its fairly tough but flexible
othewise i would still be thinking about this one
no transistor amp i own sounds as good
i have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable
i would suggest going with the black for this reason
delivery packaging etc were very good
this was recommended and i am happy with the product
this is the only reason i gave them four stars
it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand
i have to say it is one good funny lookingclip on tuner
for a number of reasons
this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly
but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style
i highly recommend this item
low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11 00
whichever set one ultimately chooses cant go wrong with the qualityprice ratio
i wouldnt be surprised if they are made from china
this works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three
the directions are in the package
joyo makes great quality products  cheap
after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin
they are made in  the usa and they use recycled packaging
i got the package of two
still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool
the soft case is very nice also
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you
i have not used it yet so i cant say much
its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades
it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range
i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software
i sometimes play in a park or outside around the bbq
the tone last longer than any other string and they dont break on me
just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal
there are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings
whatever the name this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp
couldnt pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price
ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this
these hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended
easy install and great price
plug in ipod or computer with 35mm male cable
not a lot of white clipon tuners around
this is a must for black guitars
it goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily
i bought two sets of these for two of my fender 4x10 bass cabinets
i was tuning in a dimlit room and was able to read it perfectly
i used it with live 8
i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone
the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite
its never worked properly since
size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable
i recommend if you need a winder just buy this
i use p90 single coils on my godin lg and these strings sound great
then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out
i cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good
i just move it around the house wherever i feel like playing
otherwise it gets a big hard to read
these strings seem to last longer than the others ive used
i want to get more guitarjust to get a other one
but it may not hold up forever
the mic does exactly what i wanted it to do
i have been using them for about 6 months
with this said over time there is a possibility of wear
and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup
since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them
but still 2x the cost of the jimi
purchased these for a new heritage h575 arch top
i also received one without a battery which upset me at the time
but within 10 minutes of using it itll stick with you much better
thats about 58 inch thick
id definitely recommend them to anyone who doesnt like tying on their guitar straps
but there is no counterweight here so its best used at shallow angles
its a nice guitar for the money
i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it
i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great
these are probably the most wellknown pads available and probably the best
there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups
these light strings go from
i like using this clean
perfect pedal it sounds great no matter what your levels are
i have 7 of these bad boy tuners and i love them
if you have a minimixer you can do the same thing with that
it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime
the tone is very good but not exceptional
it will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar
geat value for the money
get it youll love it
they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre
i own several and have had no trouble with them
great pedal once you get it dialed in
i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy
but even when its off im getting absolutely no buzz from my effects
this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described
a simple modification but bordering on genius
recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun
overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand
ive used elixirs for about five years now
this stand is small compact and sturdy
its quick its accurate and it just works
i have purchased several amps over the last 7 months see the reviews
one less thing to set up carry around and worry about
i bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son
hopefully behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price
good materialdecent paddingnice front pocketzippers function without issue
they are excellent quality clear tone and a great look
the fender logo makes it look legit
didnt want to spend 150 for a reverb so gave this a try
polish w an expansive polishing cloth
the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves superhandy elastic cord wrap
ive removed 1 star because of the 14 casing
this is indeed a 6string ukulele
it truly does have true bypass and logical controls
rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap
i dont have any real praise or complaints about this
use on blue strat and looks great
my taylor is much louder now that i use these
it costs more but has more functional value to me
5 stars for price quality features amazon
as i get better i will upgrade
i could never get the levels right
it has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come
i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build
edit  92212i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow
this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements
dont get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable
its ok for the money and works good
it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable
the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
summarygreat pedal buy it youll probably keep it
these are the absolute best picks ive ever used
this is not the case
hopefully more reliable than sn2
not sure what other than complete failure would take stars away
oh well it was cheap enough to have around
it is flexible yet stationary
worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed
fenders at least americanmade ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these
i needed to run my boss gt100 and vocals through it on stage
the connection strap is a great enhancement for my d18 and fits wonderfully
i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all
this is a fantastic product if you understand its limitations
the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides
they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well
listen to the voice of experience grrr
without the update this tuner was borderline terrible
this is a great quality microphone and at a good price
i particularly like the right angle plug
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks
and youre gonna do that right
sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and its okay
it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast
here are my pros and cons
direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring
the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leatherlike material
i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money
it is easy to use
it just snaps on to your mic stand
they are well made reliable and cost effective
i traded in my line 6 and also purchased a roland micro cube
fyi  parchment is slightly off white
as the title it works the way its supposed to
i am amazed at how good the strings feel now
i tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both
a friend had and os2 on hand and let me use it
bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable
built like a tank im pretty sure it will out live me
obviously behringer cloned the mackies and did a good job
so whats not to like
after using it a couple of times i can only give it high marks
imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability
it cut through really well
i recently went electric again after 20 years
i own a few of them
great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars
the shoulder strap makes me feel important
really am impressed with this gig bag
i have yet to try them with my microphone
i bought a bunch of these when i started building my pedal board
and is much better quality
but the more i use it the better feel i get for it
found a method done by another searching online
the construction is pretty good
but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion
these do a good job of isolating out the sound
i replaced my delay foot pedal with the behringer vd400 analog delay
as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list
i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise
i like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases
this little guy fit the bill
also this tuner is tiny
it is limited in what it can do but it does the job
setup is finished and i can now agree with most reviewers
this is from the cleartone cables website about gold connectors don
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today
doesnt cost 11000 dollars other
340 holes in my allparts neck  theyre a little large
only used it a couple times so far but i like it
for the functionality alone its definitely worth asking price
i use it with my samson cl8 condenser and it is perfect
thats not the case here
they are picks for guitars and they work
but over time this starts to disappear
firstfinding a driver to use was a pain
maybe a little clearer cleaner sound
it worked great then one night again i couldnt hear myself recording
most the reverb selection sound identical
the features and sound are the same
this is a super solid price too
it gets the job done and seems durable for my needs
it works with all of them
also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order
when set on blink they blink way too fast
i hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done
but the sound just lacked warmth
if youre tired of using batteries pick this thing up
the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic
if it didnt i would not buy boss product period
you gotta bend over and flip those
its got some good features although i dont use them
i have three mic stands with this one being the fourth
hosa guitar cables work great
i recently built a bass myself and i install this one
some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic
think about it if you dont get it
my uke does not fit well in the stand
we are a perfect match pizza and me
having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere
washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries
please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones
this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds
im very pleased with it and recommend it
it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price
love love love this pick holder
i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures
this is an amazing guitar for the price
any lower and it is a steal
my budget must be tripled at least
mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex
for something but not a guitar
however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock
i ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks
update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic
cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft
fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage
a friend gave me a few of these and overall i like them
i needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs
id order again if i needed another one
recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar
good structural integrity thus far
support cords seem to be of good quality
some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks
this guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish
you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly
and so far i havent lost any yay
really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it
my goto string brand for any stringed instrument
the 5w setting can really crank out the volume
it doesnt seem to affect the playability
does the job of holding a mic
small price for big help
very pleased with timely arrival of the package
this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal
well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts
it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music
ive had one for about 10 years
the sn8 is small  unobtrusive
if youre a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration
we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it
buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it
amazine that it works off a 9v battery
good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano
also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes
any less and id look dumb
considering what you get for the price
it is great that amazon stocks these making ordering convenient
buy a few youll be glad you did
are you kidding me at this low price
other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss
the frets are properly aligned and the instrument stays in tune
the h2 unlike my pricey sony can handle both
this is a good pick
theyre just as solid as the pricier ones
this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while
the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it
it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on
there are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers
plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo
i highly recommend digi stuff
at first i didnt like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock
also play the the concert scale banjolele
nice bends and of course the longer playing life
setup was easy and quick
wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe
my last comment is in regards to the h4n as a usb interface
they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price
unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch
these rubber picks metal picks etc
thered is also an ab switch that is almost a tone mode
only two things to gripe with  1
this is the one hands down worth a minimum of 150
a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week
the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go
five stars for being a better jazz iii
it holds where i left it over a year ago
it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal
they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon
probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately
but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low
i got this duet2 instead of the singlelight version as most kindle users do
next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by its specs
black or red the color is the only difference
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position
i have to say that i am fairy impressed
it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks
it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way
it has tuned them all very well
tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially
you wont be disappointed if you do
every couple months i change something making upgrades
it is a great idea and worth the cost
small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction
was easy for my husband to use
yes i would recommend them to other uke players
cons  built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped
if you can find this for less at a local shop go for it
lee oskar harps are the best value
very lush and sweet to listen too
sometimes its noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible
not the easiest battery access ive ever seen
its simple and very secure
this is the 2nd set of these fender parts ive ordered
i figured she pretty much got what she paid for
my guitarbanjos tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass
both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal
they had good reviews and the price was right
not only that but they sound great
easy to setup easy to use
this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned
its not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable
very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar
one wouldnt fit in my soundboard another wouldnt lock in my mic
this thing sounds completely transparent when its off and completely natural when its on
the handle gets real sticky and causes problems
i cant really go back to normal sized picks now
its been a little over 2 years and ive used it ever since
for a few bucks more ill stick with schallers
i like them so much that i own five
i still check but they just wont pull out or release
these nobs fit great and look great
do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab
from here you can get any type of compression you want or need
i tried all three modes  carodid carodid  10bd pad and omni
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
this is a great value for a practice and travel instrument
a small but effective little amp
96mm or prs 10 picks
all 12 were in there all of them fender mediums
this is a pretty hot pedal
i doubt youll be disappointed
that being said dont let that detract you from buying this
so far i am very happy with these strings
not expecting much i adjusted the tension
good product so far just wouldnt recommend it
compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss
but those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself
this tuner is spot on every time and super fast
if you jump over to these http www
as with all boss products ive been very happy
i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one
i purchased this for my sons acoustic guitar
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage
the one lone tube in the micro terror is the preamp tube
the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp
once i figure that out all was right again in my universe
not for long seasons anyway
we will see how long they last
the casing is made of heavy duty i dont know what gauge solid steel
hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off
for the price its a bargain
its a pop filter it works well and does the job
sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent
and gotten the 12 channel one
these strings are good especially for the price
ill probably be returning this unit asap
item works as advertised very easy to hook up
if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc
these were purchased for my parts bin
if you dont have a ts type pedal this is a good cheap choice
these headphones are 100 amazing
if the puppy murders this one ill order up another one just like this
the mc401 on the other hand doesnt color your tone at all
they work well after adjusting them to fit
and my tele sounds as great as it always did
i think i saw micro and thought shorter
im truly surprised by all the good reviews here
there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal
its does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
the display is very easy to read
come on guys not all of your customers are 13 years old
the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more
when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal
this is to be expected at this price
these dava picks are very nice
the other effects are icing on the cake
they make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well
breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response
great sound works just like a phaser should
it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use
are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals
mediumheavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold
i am not good at putting things together without help
i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks
the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic
simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime
i mean cmon what can you expect for that price
i love this little device
great for beginners or the pros
i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker
but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong
while this is not a 300 tape delay
they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case
easy to put on and tune
the inside is nicely lined the hardware is solid
and ive been playing stringed instruments and ukus for quite a while now
i bought some planetwaves cables for 40 that didnt even last me 2 years
instead its in a landfill
i decided to give it another 24 hours
but i cant help it  i like this guitar
seems to work just fine for my needs
capos are not something that i shop for
2  it wont clean up when you turn your guitar down
they are the best out there
even plugged into my best preamps in studio
then the intellitouch tuner hit the market
consumers require choice but with the shure sm58 there need be none
a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin
i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional
i agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup
unlike many tube overdrive pedals this thing has tons of volume on tap
i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up
which is not a bad thing if thats what you are looking for
nearly all do but some companies like blue snowball snowflake etc
i could not be happier
the best nonrackmount reverb i have ever had
another great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v18v
it helps to clean the guitar
i record songs in my home as a hobby
for my first gig bag its ok
clips onto pretty much any mic stand
didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing
easy to set mic slides in or out up or down
for the price i have no complaints at all
this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues
if youre a purist dont ever use a pedals or even electric guitar
thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try
is the mini sent from heaven
i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome
great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers
they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required
it is even large enough to use with my 12 string
for the price i paid cant beat what i got
the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good
use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though
the product comes in a clam shell package
you see i purchased an open box speaker
the included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes
display is very easy to read and lights up nicely
after getting these the game picks them all up now
be aware that this clutch has only two positions  open and fully closed
hand angle can also play a part in this
it pretty much does what its supposed to
i bought this for my taylor 714
and im so glad i did
perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest
it is probably the most favored pick among all companies
this a great device to put my genuine planet waves signature picks in
even at the price its sold at the build quality is pro level
their tone is great and the nanowebs feel nice when youre playing
to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way
this stuff works great and lasts forever
i thought it would be resin or plastic
this is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three
the stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string
but the elixir sounds  feels better
it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place
it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time
so far it is working well for me
as for size its designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars
most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot
but if playing on the street corner is your thing
does as described and really enhances your tone
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there
gaskets can take care of that
probably ok for solo gigs or home practice
id suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions
not much else you can say about it
after twisting on it twice i stripped it out
its small and conveniently stored too
but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses
no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it
i like the way they sound
been a fan of these for years now
i compared it to other poly straps i have and its ok
these big stubby picks have solved that problem
when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune
works great on voice overs singers and rappers
hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables
rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive
88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing
my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent
this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality
i love these picks and the
i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great
i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars
item body is plastic rather than metal
i do not recommend this product
with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get
i cant say its bad
i ordered an 11hole pickguard and it fit like a glove
when it arrived 3 days later it was a good one
like any other tool it doesnt always fit or please everybody
i love the fact that the feet do this
it fits the guitar nicely
switch it for this black one
for that reason i just ordered another sn1
the tuner has an autoshutoff function to preserve battery life
i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp
this one fits the bill
i prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord
i used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month
price was good for a useful accessory
im not grading the switch on that
it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely
something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning
the tuner is perfect for me
light weight but holds a lot
but its well built and would make a decent od
a real money saver a very smart buy
its not stamped to be one so thats why im confused
i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive
i think it sounds fine
ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not
my guitar just love it
dont expect a 2 octave bottom because it doesnt do that
for someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal
theres nothing rinky dink about it
just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly
however ive used one of these boards before
this being said its a nice tuner and stays on
sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried
the back rest support is nice too
wish they would hold a couple more
easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end
buy a pack and try them out
they are as named very light
i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks
they last and they stay in tune
all i wanted was a simple tuner
if you see a price drop below 495 dont buy
all in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly
great idea in different colors
and i dont even like digital
they have good signal though and dont seem to alter the tone
a deadsimple idea that works great
constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment
it needs some force to put it into place
who uses flexible mic clips
i like onstage and own several of their products
directions dont include the proper details
lots of gain tons more than my boss sd1 wthe monte allums sd808 mod
first the tuner issues that ive been reading about
it was about 5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine
the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic
the knobs are solid and work just fine
when inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage
they had mimimal oilstain from the factory
tons of character and tone
it has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders
the drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late
i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes
ive ordered 9 of these and only one has been defective
i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar
right out of the box this guitar was flawless
for those players bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars
as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on
these are great lights for music stands
its a great mic for the price
but for the price you get what you pay for
but i do feel confident in what i report here
and it would be but the holes are too tight
the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth
works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears
for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions
the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle
ive been buying gear from alto music since 1980
could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os 106
im a basement rockstar  the mustang gets it done without any problems
i saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled korg
this capo is solid and well made
i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way
a lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade
gb e were all flat on the fret side
i have tried many types of steel strings
especially on the ml designed guitars
you can count on me for future purchases
grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year
its no toy its a real retro electric guitar effects pedal
the analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal
it is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera
in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
will purchase an extender to use with it
the only complaint ive heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight
i only have used this tuner on classical guitars the ones with nylon strings
not worth the purchase in my opinion
folks this thing is built like a tank
there are two ports for speakers on the back side i havent used yet
mine wasnt that cracked and it worked great
would like to purchase another one in the future
if you dont have one get one
there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars
there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop
a day doesnt go by where the stand is not in use
behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny
so if necessary give it a tryand more than one
ultimately my search was narrowed down to this spider and a fender mustang
i just got this to run my passive pa
you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides
press again and it begins playback
nice picks much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks
i own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there
it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means
replaced the battery only once
i would recommend this to any beginner
no 15watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings
i would not put them on most martin dreadnoughts for example
get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun
obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad
spot on when used correctly inline with cables
he is thrilled with this guitar
modified is more scooped saturated
this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues
immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings
just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag
its like a hard plastic not metal like most are
i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering
most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga
dont go for this for modeling
the best deal for recording beginners
the leather is very soft and flexible
the padding is comfortable but slightly heavy velcro flaps make installation easy
and of course the guitar sounds good
only issue in tuning drop d or b on a 5  string bass
this one is pretty decent especially at the price point
ive been thoroughly impressed with this pedal
i have them all and they all work great
this amp is perfect for that
i got one of those for my next mandolin after my johnson
the board itself is made out of welded metal and its very sturdy
id recommend it for finding what suits you
this stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way
im glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available
i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect
uncoated strings last me about a month
its exactly what you would expect from behringer it works
we mounted our two ukes on these
carefully adjusted to add littleno volume to the signal path unity gain
go sell your snake oil to someone else
otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding
my guitars are now out of their cases and up for display
the switch is a click metal button similar to those used on mxr pedals
25 stars rounded up to 3
i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily
i dont think this is a true steel block
in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists
im not sure why but it is very frustrating
through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear
the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well
it is built very well with long lasting parts
i never realized how dry the wood was
but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright
its does not appear to be of better quality
its got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too
i got the aged white
folks ive tried them all from dean markley to ernie ball
this capo however just works simply smoothly and its a great pleasure to operate
besides batteries arent that expensive
but since my room isnt perfect this will do
i keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases
if i was really good i can see the need
but for now im impressed
the base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy
fast delivery and a good price
solid and steardy case that will last a very long time
not quite delay not quite reverb
28to be fair someone did finally contact me today
their microphones do a great job for little cost
this pedal is simple durable affordable 40  45 and it just works
the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder
the guitar now sounds great
that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use
in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful
but no room to spare
still needed a nice touch
they dont come with cables so be sure you have some available xlrxlr
the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound
but either way i liked it and decided to keep it
its also a good choice for women
clean and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely
this is a fine product
it is easy to use
i think youll be satisfied
i works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables
it let me know that i am not a techy
that being said they also dont cost 70
i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise
i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used
however the bag was ripped in 3 places
i like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around
i love the sound but i wont use it live in case of feedback
i really wanted this to be a great product
why are you still reading this
i like it but im just playing for entertainment and at church some times
works with downloadable xedit software
the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right
works great on my 100 watt amp
both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars
this is a very reasonable price for this bag
the difference between hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable
it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup
the overdrive has a level tone and overdrive
without a doubt a very sturdy cable
its a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass
its probably not the product thats described here
being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning eadgbe
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it
this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments
what you see in the picture is what you get
if youre a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing
great little mixing console for home use and practice
definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard
hell even my cats cant do that and theyre porcelain
i cant believe i never thought of buying colored cables before
i warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and yes
and the blue pedal isnt any different either imo
ive always used the competition
brings your instrument into deadon ringing true tune across the instrument
not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints
strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle
this product is not what it seems
ive used these strings for longer than id care to admit
the xlr out goes straight to your mixer
if you like this guage youd like these
throw some strap locks on it and away you go
used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo 6
this is because prior to the mid40smost strings were made of nickel
ive had this set for about a month and a half
i used it to connect my behringer bcr2000 in midi mode naturally
it does the job perfectly
i have a nanoweb before and so far the exp16 is better
they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i8217ve played
this is still usable but it is for very big fingers
i use it for both bass and guitar and it processes the signals well
tuning with it can be condensed into one word  frustrating
simple idea but a good one
this was my first strap
i am a weekly player and have been for 40 years
it is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs
i was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp
for that its excellent especially considering its very low price
this is great but i needed an actual soundhole cover
an opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective
i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something
i have an older version of this model but it works great
looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst
the microcube came with new ac adaptor that supports 110v and 240v
these cables are solidly made affordable and really easy to differentiate on a mixer
dont force me to buy an accessory just to power it up
a great price and a good item
this is it right here
feels pretty durable im sure it will last quite a while
i use a little finger grease spray and i would recommend them to anyone
it does not sound like an amplified pedal
this bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price
as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more
its a relatively short delay which is great for many genres
still for the money a great buy
it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage
both capos had this very same problem
it was an immediate difference
im very happy with the purchase and the price was right
stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time
came in a timely manner what else is there to say
got mine for under 130 and its a great mic
this meant drilling out the holes by another 18 of an inch
the pioneer hdj 2000 has the look
the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind
i bought one of these a couple of years ago
i used this on a 5string bass
this cable is built to last
they are the right length and go on easy enough
nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions
i would recommend them to anyone
this is what it shows a simple small mic stand that dont fall over
no i would not take it on tour
i change strings quite often so it really doesnt matter
90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast
dont know why i waited so long
immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away
bought this for my son
neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp
i love the unique selflocking mechanism that it has
really tight because its brand new but its really sturdy and solid
the major problem with these is they arent large
he loved the variety  number of picks
the 34hall34 setting is phenomenal
i can see this strap lasting a long time
never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger
if you buy you wont be disappointed
very happy for the price
they just dont get any better than mxr
overall for this price you cant go wrong
sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value
they tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders
the display is very easy to read
i have that one too
also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily
5 stars because it works as its described and has a nice display
i would purchase this unit again and again
these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads
thats all i can say
it wont handle well at a large space
for that application this is the windscreen to get
the snark unlike the korg tunes by vibration
this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected
it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up
monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price
the cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups
very nice quality and very cool color to them
i just cant think of a single complaint
so it easy to quickly tune up
this cable simply feels strong and well made
the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive
my title says it all
whats not to  love inexpensive and does its job
i used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly
it sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it
cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime
it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in
they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gellike feeling
the exps are nice strings
the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes
this one works almost like a mist
great price at amazon as usual
nice cables for the price
i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing
will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much
slips right out of every pedal i have
this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea
i do not own that pedal so i can not fairly make a comparison
still you cant go wrong either way
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
it does what it is designed for
it was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners
hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro
you probably already know what this thing is and what it does
this is not how the world of music sounds
so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model
these have the sweetest tone for batterybased abuse
has worked very well so far
fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for
these are exactly what the doctor ordered
my experience with this little tuner has been perfect
i have a lot of pedals
i point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and gibson electronics
the 34fingers34 will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly
this is a great product just not for me
it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos
it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play
its a feel good guitar
on that level this strap succeeds
i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price
but for a small woman with small hands its difficult to operate
works great and love the colorful display
the tuner works quickly and reliably
much lighter and thinner then any strap that i have had
perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do
perfect for old van halen solos like in 34you really got me
either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly
the 400 has reverb on the pedal
these strings are beyond amazing
the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory
of course that is 54 solid inches of stage front though
the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pfft
this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and id buy another
so in short this is a mixed bag
ill be buying two more
this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal
you really need a tuner for this step
i have a lot of pedals
theyre reliable and easy to use
and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg4 guitar stand
the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust
im happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings
no more bendable problems i really love these extensions
ive had this for 4 days and so far its still working perfectly
for home use it is fine
i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments
i use it with my fender mustang
this design works best for me
sidenote  the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me
did try to install software on a pc with vista no luck
looks like it will last
its good overall but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me
you will not be disappointed
you can do it yourself so easily
but again reasonable minds can differ
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part
i love these string swings
sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble
it was a hassle but i got it done nicely
if it works properly and it does what more can you say
for its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playing
there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat
when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck
it looks better in person than in the pic too
its been holding up well
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all
these are very nice bright strings
less gradation in setting than other tuners
they sound great and last forever
feels great to finally have professional sounding music
these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing
i was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle
apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
it was a pleasant surprise
it works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal
and the lace patriot red silver and blue value pack
sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side away from me the player
they work well just need to be a little bigger
so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that
i am glad i did the tone is great
this one is perfect in size and price
clean low noise im used to the controls and love the sound of it
it transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true pa
i did not care for the tone or feel
the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween
for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup
it looks very professional and works without any problems
good quality and doesnt cost very much
i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies
so i am very happy with them
this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first
a very good price for an excellent product
the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine
buy if you need a stand
two pieces easy to set up in seconds
its great as a stand alone distortion running on a clean amp
it flows in sweeps like
ive been using these for years
i guess im just too used to the big pick
it is light sort of cheap etc
this is my new favorite tuner
it will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which i love
they come unfinished but well sanded
since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the dd3
and the price makes it a real bargain
it costs 12 bucks great microphone for someone on a tight budget
i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim
its has a cool analogvintage sound of chours
unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish
none has ever failed me so far
i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey
whats great about the dunlop design they work
materials and labor all look good to great
i didnt like the switches on the cad m179 either
picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks
i did not need it for that
this is perfect for that
the amp is just about perfect for bedroom studio or practice
but is more than twice better
i use mine with ukulele and guitars and both get tuned accurately with it
i run it through a baggs paraacoustic preamp or my fishman aura
i got a superb machine for the money
he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use
it needs to be in front of a tube amp
and they tune with amazing accuracy
furthermore they are very accurate as well
either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point
i have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus
still a great product its just a little flimsy
havent played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes
the sound i get with it is very very cool
i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin
this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though
the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly
as you lower it the support spreads out wide
i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand
martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar
cant beat it for the price
i love these dunlop capos
not sure what else can be said about a capo
sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved
is it valuable as such
especially when i practice monotonous scales
still love it but not to a 5 star level
six out of five stars
i got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens
i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case
these are a bit short only complaint
i bought this capo for mywashburn d10
it offers ample volume for small venues
very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it
for the money it does the job ok
it would be great if it had a steel shaft
looks better than the plain one
the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome
these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well
i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke
havent tried the trumpet yet
all it does is make loops
you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 8899
i installed these on my 2000ish epiphone les paul
once i got the hang of it i had no problems
im very pleased with this stand
these are my favorite brand of strings
just one thing  that strap is too big for kids
just waiting for a good deal
after taking my guitar lessons
after each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers
i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound
i would recommend something thicker for that though
but ive broken two of them
ive only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic
think of it as a supplumentary effect
three things for the benefit of other newbs  1
sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks
but you can do it
other than that they look cool in the package
another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot
simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed
the leads are actually a little too long but thats a good thing
i wet it before attaching
they even work on cymbals if youre looking for a quicker decay
dose not cut in your shoulder or back
the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible
shipping was free and fast
they are a little small
as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved
its well built enough to stand up to regular use
lasts a long time 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar
best tuneri have owned for the price
the picks are pretty comfy to hold
i still have open leads for those other pedals
very happy with my purchase
it also has a headphone output 14 inch
only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer
that is why i chose black for mysecond set
not sure why i did not try them earlier
these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used
this is a pop filter
it is perfect for mac or pc
i have used coins and washers at times
its low profile and is easy to switch by foot
the ac3 is not a set it and forget it pedal
is this guraunteed for life or something
pros  works fastaccurate and can recognize full chromatic scale
its key to not get too much tension
this is the perfect fit for all my basses
these are some bright strings
in livepractice situations at high volumes it doesnt bother me much
i decided to use light martin strings
all in all its a handy little tool to have in the gig bag
yes this guitar has an oiled finish
one stand fits not all
the outs are trs style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back
the electronics are just fine on the guitar i got
ive never found it to be excessive
any number of mods can be found online to change the sound
try to keep the sponge moist when its dry
every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig
this is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment
i just leave it on my telecaster
i am now a diehard takamine fan
decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di
it gets a great sound right out of the box
i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty
overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is bluesoriented
this is the only complaint i have about these strings
a bit annoying but not the slides fault i guess
oh and the case is a 40 freebee  buy one be happy
luckily i order two packs
i have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite
i finally purchased an ebow about a year  ago
i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical
i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition
i would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap
well made and look and feel sturdy
theres an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back
i received my cables very fast
solos just sing on this amp
one of the connections broke that is
also i like having the two polar patterns switchable from cardioid to omni
i store them in a little sandwich bag
its a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well
im having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings
they seat snug and enhances sustain
i used this on noisy hinges car doors etc
my experience with these straps has been great
im sure other picks works just fine but these are always my preference
this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there
adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect
its bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music
there is no onoff clicking when depressed
ive played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos
works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle
this is the first quickchange capo ive owned
one thing i didnt like was having reaper pushed on me
well the gibson cloth does have a whipstitch edging around it
this is a great set
the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet
this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years
after that the guitar was splendid
this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly
no frills just a plain black strap
it can holds all the my guitars with no issues
decent strings i used for a beat up strat that i had
just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more
that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all
ive had the same tuner for years
it just didnt provide any plus at all anywhere else
edit 20130407  still working fine
if youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect
so good that i bought another one
i didnt have one at all and this workgs great
after rebooting the computer the problem went away
these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier
behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this
not one product has let me down yet
they are on the small side
since ive had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it
the mxl fit like a glove perfect
overall this is an extremely wellmade tool for your guitar kit
however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes
elixer definitely still has the edge
the potential for damage here is very high
i dont even touch my morley anymore
i really like planet waves products
the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built
5 stars just for service
i saved 30 from buying another ac adapter that supports 240v
i bought the snark sn6 uku tuner
so i sent it back to amazon for a refund
you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think
again it works perfectly for my situations
they didnt solve any problems or make anything better
has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound
these feel a bit weak
no matter what color the floorcarpetstage is you can find your pick easily
holds 810 picks depending on thickness
this tuner is easy to use
i have a pigtronix philosophers tone  it made a big differrence
i just really like this little guy
the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold
this is a palnet waves and just as good as the more expensive ones
just in conclusion theres basically nothing this amp cant do at least fairly well
yes you really replace your strings very fast with this winder
what would that equate to  in hours
this is not a pick for windmilling guitarists
save your money and order this through musicians friend
and despite its very low price its very solidly built
i would only go with the sn2
this unit is quiet and very handy
rest assured electroharmonix is good stuff and the price is right
i use the ns2 when i use my chain of pedals
does it sound like an overdriven amp
ive seen an awful lot of products come and go
i was an ernie ball guy for a long time
but i wanted more of a standup doghouse bass sound like early basses had
versus the godlyke id say this is the better purchase
first the bass e 11th string broke while tuning it up
it should not be a problem to you or your guitar
and proceed to jam on maggot brain
works great with or without polish
i use these pins on some of my 34 size guitars
that couldnt be further from the truth
its compact and great to use
finish is variable be willing to accept whatever shade you get
this may have been the best money ive ever spent for a guitar accessory
believe me you figure it out at this price point
the pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust
used it for more than a year with no issues
the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem
overall nice looking feeling guitar for a beginner
taylor ships this guitar with these strings  and for a good reason
pretty deluxe strings for the price here on amazon
if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you
very good rosin and does exactly what is described
not the least bit stiff like some leather products
the back side will shed for a while before settling down
its a great deal if youre willing to do a little work on it
a  34musthave34 if you play in pits or other dimlylit venues
who says ernie ball cant make good acoustic strings
i was really impressed by the sound
for now im hanging one on the wall with this and its fine
i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have
it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use
this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality
problem solved quickly and elegantly
none of them work as good as i would like
great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price
they sound similar to the shure sm58 and we use them every day
i bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an allinone guitaramplifieretc
honestly they dont need to be at least for most guitars
as a spare cable to play at home though its pretty good
as rotosounds and theyre only a jackson not a bad string
shure knocked this one out of the park
lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference
otherwise great case highly recommended
this rack is constructed better than i had really expected
the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound
i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on
so i ended up using it to hang my rock band guitar
ive heard it compars to a fender tweed in tone
theres not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing
this is my first set and i am impressed
tap twice to stop play of the loop
i think these will be what i play from now on
does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise
if you need a tube screamer
this is a great product
ive seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead
i love the open feel from these picks
i just dont know what kind of liquid to use
it also has a different size connector
problem is i get nothing done because i cant put it down
is this the best distortion pedal
just use a cloth or paper towel
overall im quite pleased with the unit
the best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3pack
i consider this also to be a nonissue
this is a wonderful item that really works
overall though a great value for a quality cable
it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure
but this device is simple portable easy to use and just plain works
ive always found daddario quality to be great
its a great little unit
if its red youre off if its green youre in tune
do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings
i loaded them up anyway
but i received this uke defective
handel is very comfortable too
this is a terrific product
it has a deep tone and good volume
just find a stud and drill in the screws theyll hold just fine
filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup
real cost saver on batteries
it fits very well and sounds great
the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent
guitar tuned easy and holds tune well
its supposed to be very reactive to your playing
i am very pleased with this purchase
the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set
theyre probably all as useless as you imagine they might be
i use this often to record my bands gigs
but forget hooking this directly to a pc
the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar
i got this strap just to try something different than a nylon
i use this for a microphone and it seems to be solidlybuilt
these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price
this is a great little amp for practicing
the pedal has knobs for output volume and sensitivity basically amount of compression
once you place the pedals on it its kinda heavy
id say the level is beginnerintro level sound and quality
this pedal adds that i dont know what to your sound
but im not certain these last so much longer
i would buy this again
this fits the bill perfectly
ok quality and certainly better than a piece of rope
this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars
i like the recording software cubase that came with it
i have found no major issues with any of them
for this price you will be satisfied
looks great on my blond tele
completely satisfied with this purchase
who gets to play next
thats just not what it was intended to do
the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes
some people think its the power supply but nobody knows for sure
i may not even need that focusrite box now
i cannot shower enough praise on the lpb1
put the dough into the guitar not the strap
made in the usa was a great thing to see
in sunlight its too dim
this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner
60s ive been using them for years and so will probably never change
you feel different when there is a stand holding the mic
talking about plugged sound its no where close to unplugged
final blurb  my feelings about this amp are mixed
i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions
i tried them but didnt like them
i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably
of course i am just a beginner
if you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you
worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make
you have to use all of the strings once opened
what more can you ask for
planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well
tight tuning and easily used
i hate having to drill a hole in my guitars
it is very easy to apply great results and very little effort
i love the pads and the knobs
it works great with reaper
so far the behringer uca 222 is working great
i play every day and gig one or two nights
i also bought a pack of half wound 11s to try
this is perfect love it
i recommend trying it and saving some cash
they are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them
this audio adapter works perfectly
also this was priced right in my opinion
very nice metronome with just enough features
purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo
theres no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song
i take it everywhere and it has never let me down
these were things i could easily hear
the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit
i am very pleased with the 34new sound34 of my tele
i highly recommend this product
they last pretty long for noncoated strings and play nicely too
they are also very accurate i hear things just the way they are recorded
the builtin effects are probably its weakest point
makes a perfect small studio combination
but im sure something better will appear next year and until then
it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar
compact enough to stow it in a guitar case
right now though id say great product
thats why i got this
however for the price and purpose this a five star cable
that being said my go to strings are still daddario
if theirs better ones out there then i cant wait to get one
i would recommend it or purchase again
then i happened across these elixir nanowebs
the purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2
its so similar i contacted daddario to ask them what the difference was
i have used daddario ej16 pb lights for years
this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes
i have multiple guitars for different styles
the display is very stable and its simply fun and easy to use
it works so great i ordered a few more
that last one was far far better than the first two
if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me
kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping
same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo
so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand
a lot of harmonics and output captured
i may get one in the future its only 4050 bucks on here amazing
in fact its the worst contaminant ever
i bought these guitar picks for my son
you need a pa that provides 48v power to use it
these have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others
three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself
keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lintfree cloths
the bonus is that its also one of the least expensive that ive seen
it will still hold up with moderate use
holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless
the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control
theres nothing not to like about this capo
ive never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars
unless it was a cheap piece of crap
i have used this on my les paul
leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes
many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo
built like a tank and completely configurable
perfect intonation all the way up to the octave
it works good and that is all i need
a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband
synthy  seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes
it does have an internal dip switch
i used that korg until getting the snark
this fixed the chibson tuning issue
if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp
a local store wants 2999 for one set of these
and if it doesnt so what
after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved
hands down the best cable i have ever owned
these strings are not overhyped
this has more features than ill ever likely use
they work well on bass and acoustic however
the color is darker than pictured on amazon  black powder coating
use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work
it is quite bright sounding
only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as vaders
however once clipped properly you shouldnt have issues
it works and it is relatively inexpensive
this is another useful item from planet waves for the guitar player
using it as a foot pedal controller on my korg triton le
i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions
good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead
thats a considerable investment to abandon
not even a year old
they give them that extra twang
when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions
daddarios are the best and i love the ball end color coding
yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this
makes it easy to clean too
i used to work for line 6 so i know modeling pedals
great color and retro style as well
ive been playing with this a lot since i got it last week
overall i think this is a great product
i didnt expect this much volume from light strings
holds your drink just like it says it will
original posting my first mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment
recommmended if you dont mind a molded cable
i sprayed a little matteblack paint over the epiphone logo
needed this cable to hook up my dean evo to a practice amp
as far as the sn8 is concerned
just like every other strap of its kind
very sturdy well made product
they all work great and of the various models i prefer the sn2 red
500k pots and side body 14 trplug keeps the cable out of the way
quality and value all the way
for what i paid i wont bother returning them
rock metal shredding and even country
the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools
what can you say about a tool
these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm5758 series form factor
ive been playing for about 15 years and have always used a humidifier
i bought this to try out on my baritone uke
it might not be durable but it looks durable
this is an awesome analog echo effect
ive read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage
whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel
best 90 i have ever spend
this fits just right and looks just right
sounds like a great concept and they seem well made
this guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well
the quality is great for me
accurate or inaccurate not good or bad theres a difference
but thats sort of what youre getting
with the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedaling
gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop
i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux2
overall its good enough to buy it
this was exactly what i needed
i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably
overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
buy one youll use it youll love it youll be happy you bought it
no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords
the leds are a little cheesy compared to the old one though
this was for a friend who plays guitar
these locking ends are the ticket
this pedal is for metal
im using on one of my cheaper guitars
whats funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge
sound is not so good
i bought these because i wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming
now with my boss rc3 i can do it any time i want
still suck at bending 3 4
i was blown away how it could tune my bass
it does it job very well
yes if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine
again it works perfectly for my situations
i like this design better because of one simple fact
using this for a prs electric guitar with satisfactory results
i have many planet waves cables
i really dont understand why
they either use too much or too little
i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic
they seem to be decent quality
it makes working with a condenser mic easier
it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive
ive got several guitars and capos  this one is not too bad
the amp gives an audiable pop when powered down
compared these all in medium
snark tuners are the best
this will get you in tune for 11 or less  cant beat it
i do like this pick as well
he says its great so that is my review
acoustic and elixir electric strings as well
it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric
this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made
there are usually two wires of differing color
the entire tuner clipped onto the instrument
this board does the job for at least 6 pedals
this pedal sort of let me down a bit
your tone is made up of many many variables
mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket
i feel that its a good deal and  recommend it
it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition
this item is very convienent
i ended up switching back to the 12ax7
what else can be said about aquila
correctly tuned this very old guitar for the first time in years
something i didnt consider when ordering a uke
i certainly have no complaints
2  the chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough
i will never do that again
if youre looking at them then get them
i highly recommend this cable
ive never had one of these pots fail on me
works as expected and should last a really really long time
this is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me
oh that reminds me the casing is plastic
the first five have three different levels of style each
it helped me create a separate fuzzdistortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile
but always come back to this one
mine didnt come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though
definitely a great value for the money
you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings
its performed flawlessly since day one
thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive
do not let the size fool you
i have 4 guitars and they each get played once every couple weeks
they are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones
firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip
i did not think that an amp this size would sound good
this bag fits my epiphone les paul ii electric guitar very well
my eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo
i was surprised because outwardly the string didnt look that bad
i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension
to be super critical here is another tip
it doesnt seem to work
after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument
the strings are very good
its a very fat sounding cab sim
i give them an excellent rating
looks great and plays great
hangers adjust to required width of head stock
really what more can you say
long wait for overpriced item
yes this is a great overdrive
they also depend on the built in adda converters in the ipadios device
it stopped working after 2 gigs
but the adjustable clamp is really
i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport
its very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits
the sound of the current mini is classic fender singlecoil
it gets easier the more you do it
they last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular noncoated strings
the buckle doesnt seem to bother me
but id mic it anyway
they are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers
these are great patch cables
last but not least  they are bad for frets
i like the sound quality i get
this was bought based on the advice of others
as you can tell by the title ive got another of these little babies
treat these like halogen bulbs
endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer
purchased this and a comparable hosa cable
if you try playing clean with no distortion youll be underpowered
it is an extremely well made and solid product
to me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed
im sorry i bought it and i dont recommend this pedal
but however you use it it is sweet
it is accurate  very reasonably priced
delivered promptly and in excellent shape
i really like the fitfeel of this plucking pick
im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back
it feels sturdy not that i would drop it
one of these recorded perfectly also
i wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play
very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer
one person may love them the next may not
great price but very fragile
the quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch
only about 4134 long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs
i plugged it in the outlet
everything you need to know is in the title
this is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes
these kind of clips can break
but if you sleep on the left youre gonna have a bad time
they even include free picks  which is so cool
i still like the pt2 much better
it loaded right up with no problem
i must now rerate it with a 5 star
if youre looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz this is the pedal you need
when i told them the price they thought i was pulling there leg
true bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are good
im using these with the behringer 1202fx mixer
not enough of a hassle to send it back but worth mentioning
overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume
i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about 2 years
its perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use
i have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them
i use it every gig now no problems
i put my kvm switch on it and other server components
i really like the durability and clear sound quality
they dont cut the string they shear it off
basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer
my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me
typical of quality control in the peoples republic of china
you pluck your open string hard  tune as described above
for the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck
i did replace the strings shortly after getting it
it is smaller than a snark but not by much
i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation
this wah petal is so much fun
love the security of having my picks within grasp
great sounding sturdy enough build etc
i will buy another one of this
i like snarks and think they are some of the best clipon tuners
got the fender ft004 instead
for the money this is a tremendous pedal
that was initially what brought me to the micro
i expected this shure sm57 knockoff to disappoint me
im sure theyll use it often
ive been using the dunlop delrin 500 20 picks
no background hiss very good clear sound crisp no distortion excellent transmission
it sounds for the most part in tune and its tone is great
somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom
who doesnt love these tuners
took a while to find what i needed but this is what i needed
bought two of them about a year ago and im still happy with them
a definate must for any guitar player
tons of sounds and it can be 100 edited to fit your demands
they are solid look good and feel good
fuller sound with the 1046s buti cannot bend them like the 9s
makes the whole house safer for the martins
i have a long way to go
very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find
thanks to amazon for the quick delivery
i play fingerstyle and they feel great
myself i have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall
when i asked music123 about this they said oh
it is simple practical and cheap
this educational device is truly an asset to all musicians especially guitar players
i play while im playing crazy 8s with my son
bought them to replace the old 34vintage34 style knobs on my lp clone
excellent pedal i love this chorus
after owning it for several days the draw 2 hole went flat
having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly
twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping
but its much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that
the jacks are all metal
i usually use martin sps but i decided to give these a try
and my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs
i am impressed how well this works
you have to get this cap on just right or the strings will buzz
im going to get a squier strat instead with either amapleorrosewoodneck
mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue
came in a timely manner from sam ash
the notes are surprisingly cleansounding coming from a guitar thats so lowpriced
im a typical overweight american
i can tell you what it sounds like
it is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online
the design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy
the first ukelele was a lanakai lu21
its worked equally well on my acoustic  my electric
was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this
love amazon why shop anywhere else
it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add
this mic is well made heavy on the micend
would like to have a thinner one
i got 2 of these for grandkids
im pretty new to this so i take the blame
the joyo is an exact clone of the tech 21british pedal which costs 189
the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light
kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice
the vintage bbds mxr vintage delay morley 70s echo for example just take it
i needed a new strap but i didnt want to pay 20 for one
compared to my old cable the mogami gold produced a more transparent sound
that was years ago and i couldnt get rid of it fast enough
this problem is gone with the new preamp
i set up a shootout in my studio
i also like the capo tuning feature
easy to use and very accurate
ive done it successfully for years
i put a pair of these on every guitar that i own
it holds both electric and acoustics
they are a little hard on batteries but not overly so
a must for every serious guitar player
sure its a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it
build good for carry and balance
only thing that was slightly upsetting is that i only received one screw
i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing
my guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65
not a bad product acceptable at its price point just didnt impress me much
so most ukes dont fit well
easy to use interface and very well constructed
works perfectly with iphone and ipad
first off the amp shipped with bad tubes
so i ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter
one thing you will need though is a phantom power unit
no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery
the price at amazon was the best i could find without buying used crap
there is such a thing as too much
the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories
this guy not so much
highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable
i didnt realise how much noise my one spot was adding
the missing38 of an inch is a minor detail
holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well
i have always loved hercules products
definitely recommend these if youre sick of picks slipping out of your hands
makes my crappy behringer amp sound
tried them and he was right
schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players
s display to be more than sufficient
lots of metal where there needs to be metal
purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me
there are better deals for just slightly more money
i think every guitarist and bass player should own one
ive been playing rock and blues for over 40 years
that said there is only one piezo element unlike a kk pickup for example
you want that go waste your money on a line 6 or something
i dont play enough to need changes that often anymore
i like the black look to my guitar now
the construction itself is ok
it makes my guitar feel secure
things i dont like much 1
arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait
its surprisingly loud for a small amp
good buy for the cost
i really liked the sound
but i would use no other tuner on stage
mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence
ive had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite
now there are two choices for excellent coated strings
i just received this mic today and tried it out
this tu3 is easier to see and is more precise in its tunings
think about what youre used to
the 5star ratings must be from employees
free shipping for prime members
im convinced even heavier loads will be no problem
tried others but i prefer these
i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned
it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables
i love this product it works great
it also beats the other boss delay pedals available for quality sound and features
cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and dont break
stickies onto your guitar wherever
i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support
this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88key keyboard
the cords arent very long
i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz
but on this profx8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up
there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use
but a quick dialin with the electronic tuner brought that right
and look like i make very good choice
snug fit but imo not too tight
its very hard with room temp 70f
finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot
it is a quality heavy cloth case with a feltvelvet lining
i bought this boost to use in one specific situation
why do i use them then
the tuner workss as advertised
i got these for the build in pop screen
i do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom
this drop clutch is just fantastic
once its fit to you though it works beautifully
these flatwounds were a perfect choice
for the money i am not mad i tried it
they havent changed much dont fix it if its not broken
i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service
they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do
the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that visegrips work
wow  it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities
i wanted a strat copy that i could customize  this is it
this is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling
after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks
the tip is a little more rounded
so my baby boom does the trick
this is a modeling amp
it works perfect for those hard ps and strong s sounds
its the third color of the same pick i purchased
guitar bag fit over my fender t bucket guitar
but for the budget i do receomend it
im amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs
nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well
only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort
overall dimensions 6 34 x 6 12 x 2 14
this strap is a great strap
after shielding it is absolutely quiet
its just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper
after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great
these pedals last forever and i only paid 20 for mine
try different brands to find what suits you best
i read several reviews before purchasing these strings
item arrived on time and as described
you know if you do guitar work you need a neck stand
frets look good and nut looks good
sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play
nice addition to my studio
i installed it and it worked
just today i got the new tascam us100 usb audio interface
the texture almost looks fake though
i feel like i was neglecting my guitars until i got this
ok quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic
the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments
its heavy but it in a good way
20 seconds really isnt much
this runs from my guitar to the pedal
im glad i did  what a nice guitar it turned out to be
but the pushing against your head is the tight part
that huge box is then inside yet another huge box
i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all
an investment in your musical future
i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though
this pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound
so be sure to try them out first before buying
i was impressed with the sound
but then my fender doesnt have a pigs snout
this makes the unit useless
ive had no trouble with it that i can rememberthink of
we are talking about major bugs here
i just got these in and i have to say very disappointed
this joyo jf03 crunch distortion pedal is just amazing
normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long
the only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life
this is a very nice dynamic mic
i will be getting more
fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick
but for the price they are great
good product for a inexpensive foot pedal
this is a good looking strap
this is not my first planet waves locking strap
this is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound
i loaded it up with equipment and havent had a worry about it since
a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient
dont expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you wont be disappointed
i kinda think i am
on my resonator these provide a full loud sound
i use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great
i got what i paid for
for the money you cannot beat these strings
for the money its a crazy deal
i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight
i was 2495 when i got it
i am very pleased with this 1634 crash
i read in a review that these hold six picks
this is a great gig bag for the money
i guess out of sight out of mind
it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm
in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient
but for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered and is an excellent product
so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to
they sound great and play great and i usually purchase daddario or martin strings
by far the biggest change was the 34pointyness34 of the picks
more than enough decay and wetness
basically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound
included with the amp is an owners manual with simple startup instructions
when not in use i keep it parked on the headstock
just a little larger than a zippo lighter
i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic
absolutely a 5 star value
this is the best amp in this category
i lke these strings very much
got these stands to hold my guitars they are o
these work like a light switch
this is an excellent strap
almost all celtic music sounds great
i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
as close to a rack mount as it gets
i have spent a good month with my new guitar and i am impressed
i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint
good strings i would recommend them
i use it in combination with motrya gold
the finish is pretty and i like the solid cedar top
for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal
to my ear it sounds good but you never know
has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use
this one surpassed my expectations
a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try
whats the difference between the 58 and the 48
013s on a taylor 210 dreadnought
i have used fender medium picks since the late 60s
sorry if im rambling but seriously im in love with this pedal
this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode
at full price of 1699 it is a solid deal
the run around at the post office of getting it resent was ridiculous
the amazing thing is that the switch from intellitouch to intelli wasnt gradual
medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people
if anything they feel worse than regular strings
this is the best at combining two tools into one
not a huge range here
if youre considering buying this just do it
i love these picks especially in this gauge
ive had several sets for 13 years and use them without hesitation
usually longer ones are only obtainable
not really a big concern though
if you drop a pick there is another right there
ive been using them for 6 months or so
the extra light is easier on the fingers  but they sound thinner too
fender is basically giving these things away
id definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon
buttons and sliders and great for the price
a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
i have been buying these stands for years and will continue to do so
as my reviews demonstrate im a sucker for a new tuner
you need a little time to learn then it will rock you
60mm for a more raw folk like sound
i just plug in and everything sounds magical
it sounds like its behringer
they last for ever and never cause buzz or noise
maybe if youre using this to run a pa i would recommend it
it is very heavy duty great chrome plating
you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs
there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use
you will not be disappointed
its a great idea but not well executed
i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms50g
for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use
the name martin says it all  has for manymany years
so they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables
it has worked so far
we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people
since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings
it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints
you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop
also the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated
i also have the trombone and saxclarinet stand from them
just sounds flat and boring
ive been using dunlop tortex picks for years with the
youd be better off with a couple of books and a towel
i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should
tried them on epi lp and a prs
strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job
this is a great buy for the money
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
its great and stands up to much more expensive of its kind
you just cannot be without one
the brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission
went together perfectly and i really wanted it
that being said that person probably isnt playing much guitar
it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic
takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar
i like the planet waves instrument cables
its also more than just a dp008 with more tracks
works well and has good sound
sure there should be nicerbetter product but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks
i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday
this unit is very sensitive
id pay for a better one if i had to get another
really impressed with the polyweb
i almost feel like i wont even need strap locks its so good
it does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality
pickers playing next to me dont interfere with me tuning
so i cant speak to its durability at this time
that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use
i run compression wah overdrive superoverdrive delay  reverb pretty much in that order
for the price and quality i would buy two other ones
damn good for a bolt on
in which case ill probably go daddario or cobalts
34 it really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing
unity is around 8 oclock on the level knob
this pick holder is awesome
update   downgrading my rating by 1 star
but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here
on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble
this posilok miniboom is a nice clean look and is very functional
i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well
works wit all my guitars and for the price it is a steal
do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with
it didnt work very well but it is what was available to me
this is a great little tuner for guitar
and the action is now so smooth
its amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha
the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price
the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards
i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol
it seems like there is a short in it somewhere
light weight easy to carry
either they kind of 34disappear34 when youre playing or they feel like a hindrance
great pedal for a great price
theyre my favorite picks and i always buy the medium ones
they have a high build quality and work great
good design easy to hang on to these picks
a heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged
allinall i found no flaw in these strings
at the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars
it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap
this is a quick easy improvement
they work flawlessley and tune is amazing
im in love with the dual design system
you could also leave it attached to your camera
turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean
has a tuner and a metronome
these have become my favorites
i prefer it to the 58 seems a bit more bright and natural
ive been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago
like most nickel strings do
60 to 80 hours perhaps maybe a bit more
i am very satisfied with my purchase
planet waves aka daddario is a wellknown name in guitar accessories
they are cheap and look good
some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet
for the money you cant go wrong with this effect
a lifetime warranty means youll have it forever
i dont really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a 34ukulele34 setting
these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys
digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible
this little stand is great
each of the legs has 3 holes low middle high
if u have hand problems  try these
it also has a lifetime guarantee
i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture
since i bought these i have been using the heavy thickness ones
it is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings
when playing the strings behave as normal
he has enjoy and likes using the capo
works great so far and dont regret purchasing
and it arrived in 4 days since i returned the first one
and was actually pleasantly surprised that the snark sn2 had a mic
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
i am using it for both some music and computer stuff
my new guitar had only the back strap connector
theyre fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent
this incredible inexpensive box really nails it
i prefer that the rings all be brass one color
so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin
it also has a lock on the case in case one might need it
a couple of the marshall settings arent bad either
all of the cables worked perfectly
i have found that everything schaller makes is grade a1 in my book
i really like the stability of the one i bought
the tension is a little tighter than id like but works for me
uses a 9v battery or 9v adaptor
this is a no brainer
they snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality
too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation
i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use
i ordered both this one and the lee oskar
3 great vocal microphones in its own protective case with its own holders
i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems
i have the small version
it really makes the guitar stand out
this is a good one at a good price
do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument
he uses elixir for both and swears by them
i use this capo all the time on both instruments
much more sturdy than it appears in photos
these hooks are padded and rotate a little
great quality an very robust
just go for the gusto and find what you like
its a decent tool at a good price so buy one
that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it
again do your youtube homework and listen around and youll come to your conclusion
the fg 700s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar
why do i go through all that you ask
this arm is a direct replacement for the original
the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light
i find i do better with heavy thickness
speaking of power adapters  a previous reviewer is right
my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job
i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky
get one of these if you play with a pick
they are even and not warped like the stock ones were
my son has also joined in the fun
i never cared much for the sound
good strings with good sound
these are the only picks i use
the lighter the less tension you should use
having two tone controls makes all the difference
however that was before a firmware update
i consider it cheap insurance
not worth the time   to send it back to amazon
its a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part
pay the extra money and get something quiet
on top of all that it looks nice too
great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless
this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension
they work great theyre quiet and theyre cheap
this really cleans your strings
well obviously that depends on the strap
the 3pack is a fantastic deal
it has no problem with the low e string
pot lockwasher nut and cap are what is included
you can mess around swapping parts pickups and capacitors
it polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new
the jasmine s34c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price
however i like the look of sm58 and it seems to be extremely durable
my primary concern is  how does the pedal sound
they dont come much better
pretty simple it does what its supposed to do
the switch should be on the side of the unit
this is great idea to clean guitar strings
it looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand
they are stainless steel and very smooth
then i found this and decided to get it
as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere
what i like about this one is how the release lever works
what can i say about a guitar strap
i played it finger style and strummed with a pick
well what can i say
expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time
i used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier
theres really nothing i can add to whats already been said about this tuner
best straplocks i have ever had
it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp
i bought this to use with my keyboard
i can think of a million simple solutions to that but thats another story
i like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic
using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical
this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar
it is just not a good stand
these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use
the tool is made of sturdy plastic
one this is a long island company located in farmingdale new york
i had to have one
the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok
it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay
people are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish
i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers
overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly
easy to install on the guitar
if so you can stop reading
they also make one with the 90 degree 14 inch input as well
it may be the best string ever or not
just found out the best part of this amp
the price is great too
because its so effortless to hold i can focus my attention on other things
think of marshall cleans or even vox
i broke down and im glad i did
this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice
they do not have any detectable noise or issues
if you are considering this instrument dont hesitate
certainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal i have used
i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner
you get 30 days to register it
maybe it just needs to be broken in
you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased
they are very comfortable and easy to control
nice padded seat well constructed
the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video
still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job
i may buy a second one as a backup
and i like the durability it seems like it will have
i bought these for the soprano ukulele i bought for my little great niece
this is certainly a heavy duty stand
i have a mustang iii and it gets destroyed by the zt
this thing stands up nicely on all three
i own and use them both
these last long without compromising the tone
high quality solid support and good design decisions all around
all of my guitars are strung with daddario 10s
i certainly recommend daddario nylon strings on classical guitars
perfect for my beginner studio setup
so it was very much a lovehate relationship
not too hard not too soft
it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs
quick to clip on and off
i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one
the athm50s are really solid studio headphones
oh maybe a tiny bit
second time i bought these
the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric
maybe i just got a bad one
the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it
i just got done stringing them and they sound great
i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this
i also have the very first jamman with the add on 3 button footswitch
todays sm7b is the best noncondenser vocal microphone still in production
this was exactly what i needed and worked out great
i just order 3packs so i can have some on hand
there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psusb
this clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use
too hard to push notes through them
its great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar
i bought this for my 1974 martin d18 for recording on my pc
youll never get your arm in there far enough
i could never get the sound i wanted using other manufacturers strings
behringer makes great products at incomparable prices
they work great every time
if you have a standard size guitar neck dont bother with that
so i did a little research
i would buy it again
have them on four guitars
well made and just what i was looking for
i bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar
it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too
will just move on to another companys cord
id even say it was cute
this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallowbodied ovation
the capo is made of metal and works well
or are you know how to use capo
not much else to be said
what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it
i am glad i didnt break budget here
the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds
so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts
already has made my life easier
this is a review for themahalo u30pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink
they may be more than the mando needs
i think it is a well made product and good value
guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot
a must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables
this is a wonderful little looper
the whole strap is leatherno adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument
this one blows that one away
fit and finish is quite nice
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison
the reviewers werent lying except that one guy who gave it a 2
it feels like you get a boost in your midrange
i like this mic very much
but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open
more for the intermediate musician
indeed this little bluelighted wonder will make you famous
this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewines books and it works great
this one offers almost no protection
when i run it alone to my crate i havent experienced this
i also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend
ill wait and see how they hold up in the log run
keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking
i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill
the coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure
great device and good price
they are black plastic ones
the whole thing has a good weight
the edges did not catch completely  and it looks terrible
maybe it is my locations but that was great too
it came to me right on time with no problems at all
these capo i know will lose their tension in time
my frist guitar strap i like it alot
the coversion cable didnt work
i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night
the sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next
i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something
these arent usually my goto strings but daddarios are a good solid sounding string
a lot of options available with this goodsounding pedal
i have other harmonicas but thought id like a set of blues harps
the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless
i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house
thanks for taking care of me
they hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style
where else can you get a greatfunctioning delay pedal for this price
these picks were a good deal
these cables are very good
the chorus effect has plenty of adjustment tone and depth
at the end im satisfied with the 2035
wouldnt even think twice about it
i am now thinking about trying this on my martin
its a mic cable haha
all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great
9 million pounds and no casters
works fine on some guitars
if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery
they had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support
i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle
this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system
not too big and gets the job done
every once in awhile ill step outside of my box
simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band
pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well
excellent bag for tripods or stands that dont need a lot of protection
you have to do it from the software
for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase
the strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition
wash up in soap and water and let dry
it has the perfect balance of flex and strength
and i can even hold onto it
these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables
but when the humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements anyway
thank god i buy spares
grab some extras because you will want more great pricegreat strings
if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string
good strap at a good price
if you are looking for a 100 leather mandolin strap consider another strap
i ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass
nice clear tones with this pick tips
less time tuning  more good time playing
thats why i dont use them anymore
then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow
i got this product to see if i could fix the problem
hey its a pick its 10 to a bag
its compact has great voice pickup and audio recording clarity
just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string
i have a pretty crappy ear so i rely on it to tune correctly
but for a small room its great
there isnt much about it that would give away its price
a fine product that i expect to last for years
the strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what i needed
i cant wait to see what they do next
it also is easy to store when finished
incidentally this pedal like any other digital delay or digital reverb will eat batteries
other musicians were impressed by it as well
seems like it is part of the design
ive read where people are using bottle caps instead of these
i cant speak on the claim for a longer string life
not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place
even with that issue i think the jam is a good value
but i only use the tortex pics
but oh boy i like it
i put these suckers on there and wow was i impressed
im happy with this pickup
through sweat dirt and cigarette smoke they eventually start to look nasty
check out the ada gcs3 if you can
this is my second sm48 in 25 years
and no tape or other sticky stuff
i have been playing guitar for 30 years and these are the best
and the top part isnt pink like the pic also as others have mentioned
as others have noted the finish can vary drastically
do i get a fortune cookie with that
for metal artists i would recommend looking elsewhere
item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging
i kept it because to be honest it is very cheap
sixth the price is amazing
ive read some negative press about behringer pedals but personally cannot complain
its a fine 34first34 guitar
i did the length first then thickness and finally the height
the device tunes within 610ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner
however a standard 2 driver is too big to fit into the strapbuttons
beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle
i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand
i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps
most under 400 guitars dont have good pickups so why spend extra money
1540 people like itwho am i to disagree
this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now
im a beginner and can change my own strings so im proud of myself
these things muffle sound great
i own several of these and love them
could i pull off amazing licks that i couldnt do with my normal picks
being from tampa i wanted my first guitar to be a dean
with flatter eqs it is fairly noiseless
if you really want to go for something a bit more 34marshall jcm900 like34
other than the above excellent pedal
to my ears the rest were less distinctive
overall good cloth for general use
a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up
the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps
the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options
thats really all its designed to do thus 5 stars
i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
i have been using dadario strings for 30 years
we all have our likes and dislikes
for 2000 it is worth all day
it records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models
ill be damned if i put my 1000 guitars on these things
well worth it for the price
easy to hold on to
the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish
such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz
it is a string winder what more can i say
i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer
at the time i bought was 16
i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning
im a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords
also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones
this cleanspolishes all of my guitars great
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars
not sure if thats from rough handling
for the  its the best buy in my opinion
ive been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30 years
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
the soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish
it makes tuning a breeze
its powered via the usb
its quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag
thats a win for the customer because it decreases the price
a few are actually a notchabove the others
this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints
i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was misswired
best to have a noise gate handy
this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm58
dont waste your  on others with similar specs
this is a great effect
sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings
yes these strings are amazing
no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors
you cant go wrong with these were ordering 8 more pairs
if you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect
i didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good
gives you virtually unlimited sustain
for such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service
the beat boy is everything that this unit is and then some
recommended by eric friedman on a post and im glad i followed the recommendation
they provide enough surface area that they wont slip easily from between your fingers
ill update this review if i ever figure it out
i am super impressed with this little thing
the only complaint i have is that theyre too thin for me
this is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface
i was turned on to this and i was truly blown away
will hold any guitar that ive seen
but for me they are still tops
if i shove them in i cant get them out
i use it put mh guitar and harp mic through the same rig
not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing
its just not strong enough
if your looking for a studiohome1st amp you cant go wrong with this guy
makes nicks and scratches less noticeable
i use this pedal mainly for the 34church34 setting in ambient volume swells
it is very safe for guitar finishes
much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level
bought several of these and they worked fine
it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time
and you will need a longer usb cord
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
this is a very useful and quite educational musicians piece
it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too
they stay in your fingers well
ive used all the ins and outs with no problems
soundwise i dont find that theyre significantly different from any other pick
could choose any note since its chromatic
i drilled into wooden studs
overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand
get a snark and you will be happy
the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit
will order another set soon
this works great with the mustang i amp
the tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price
pretty doesnt count for much with me
but its not the reason why i drop by one star
the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position
doesnt sound good playing fast
because its not programmable im getting another
i rate it at 5 stars
this microphone works well for our needs
should last a while with good care
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
if you cant afford a better guitar may be worth a try
got the marshall dsl 40 watt combo
this was one of two i purchased
it has a terrific sound and its gorgeous
we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom
this is a really cheap microphone
thus it is pretty short even when stretched out
this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique standalone sound
this little tuner is made to be left on one guitar
i got these for about 12 here on amazon
this one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap
great for beginners and intermediate players
very pleased with this purchase
i tried this with regular guitar but its not the same
i put the nyxl set on my ibanez artist with dimarzio  humbuckers
it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway
you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube
i prefer a standard pick for that
it works greatit keeps my music in order
the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo
the stand is very easy to set up
thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best
100 e they have a
as i strummed each string to sound was so clear
and silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board
does exactly what you want it to do
the tm300 is more than just a distortion box
otherwise id highly recommend a more expensive model
i think its a wonderful and adequate musthave for any musician
the bottom clamp never did secure properly
overall this is a great pedalboard
my guitar i guess but who cares
at this price hard to complain too much
you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed
good leather that should last a long time
the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides
you do not need usb to get this to work
it doesnt cut the bass out
bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions
bad points  1 the package it comes in says its a 20foot cable
the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects
i have been using strap locks of all types for years
i will continue to use it
this is a very well made guitar stand
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback
my advice is look for a more sturdy model
youll be happier trust me
can get all of the reverb sounds you want
so far the so good used for almost a month now
people cant belive its a 50 dollar mic when i tell them
i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin
mxl really should reconsider its association with reaper
this can be used to  semi  record music too
well what can i say
has multiple patterns to collect sound
these strings are as advertised
i would definitely recommend these
most definitely one of the best 34bangforyourbuck34 acoustic guitars
in fact its beautiful and totally functional
easy to read and for the very low price a great value
they made it sound even better than it was
its made in china but isnt most everything these days
this one is more confortable and has great grip
31014 edit  looper control is flawed
ill try the dava picks again later if i feel the need
one final note  these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage
its heft heavy and feels well made
the sound is great good balance between highs and lows
my other review was not fair
while waiting for it to come  i had to change one
the customer liked them so much he kept them on
they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had
this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar ok
sound wise these are great for their intended purpose
it took me two hours to get it all working
the front metallooking grill is mesh but quality and looks great
its cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp
042 on the low e which is just too small for good twangy bass
fret and its right on the 34money34
ive mounted my samson q1u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it
10 ft is nice for home
after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic
do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only
then theres the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadnt considered
all in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point
no loss of tone through these cables
i thought id miss it but i dont
did i mentioned great value
it is so simple and so reproducible
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
its nuts being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic
however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors
after 2 weeks im still loving the guitar
sounds decent and stays in tune
for the money this mic performs very well
this strap is strong and sturdy
reality  lets say the stand held onto the guitar
very little instructions at all actually
these cables seem to be qualitymade
plugged straight into my bass amp for home recordingpractice
this guitar tuner is such a great and useful tool
again i was very happy with the results
this guitar will make you a more versatile player
i buy elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now
i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home
couldnt be happier with this product
this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost
more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for
this just doesnt work for me in the studio
holds my seagal s6 very well
arrived quite quickly but a tracking number wouldve been nice
good idea but way too lightrickety to be useful
i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use
they help me pick up my guitars much more often
reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit
thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster
they all had pluses and minuses
i ran it through my swr california blonde ii acoustic amp
the distance between the plugs is sometimes too short
i used to buy all shure productsim switching to gls
no fancy expensive flashy grip features
even when detected by the software it will not work with line 6 equipment
my fault but it shouldnt have broken so easily
its essentially a 9v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light
these hold up great year round
even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal
i decided to try them out
i bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there or across town
some people complained that the handle doesnt work
the jf02 is a really nice dirtbox  and not just for the price
however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy
ive used many strings and owned many guitars
this little amp does everything i need for small gathering
and it mikes well too by the way
i bought this because it was cheap and figured it cant be that bad
switches and knobs feel sturdy
if i ever need another ill be getting another fender gig bag
i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever
just like the ones in the store
it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box
i bought these black locks to go on a black stratocaster i built
has a great clean tone with a lot of low end
oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech
i would purchase another if i needed it
88 mm picks for that
i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc
im guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel
they have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark ernie ball feel
its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly
but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else
my son was very happy with this guitar strap
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn1
one of the best tuners out there
it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous
it works fine but its inconvenient
his old one lasted about 10 years
the sound is so warm and bright
i will never use strap locks again after trying these
not that i hated them just didnt really love them
also certain notes sustain while others seem to die out too early
these strings are different and really quite nice
they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price
overall pretty good and very simple to operate
it works well with cleaning spray
ukulele straps are a rare thing and ive yet to find the perfect one
i use daddario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics
for playing they sound pretty good
it is just as describedi am happy
the stand with my guitars looks awesome
im happy with the reults my 40 got me
better to have a little bit of extra length than too short
not much to say really other then they are good strings and work
weve used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity
long lasting and backed up by the company
sweet sound with an older fender amp unit though
schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with locktite
i just requested a returnexchange from amazon
yes and for good reason
my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable
at this price its kinda like the amp itself  a no brainer
further its class complaint so you dont have to use behringers drivers
you can talk into your instrument
great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced
shipping was fast and id definitely recommend these
this is my 1st gator case and im very pleased with it
they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck
i installed them on a prs se santana in just a few minutes
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product
i recommend this to everyone a lot of product for an affordable price
cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it
you can get a lot more for your money these days
undaunted i ordered this musicians gear stand
the people who hear us only hear us through their ears
the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for
it could be used on just about any instrument
its quite a bit stronger of a microphone also
i have no quality issues with them
i have a 1918 chezch violin and its sparked my 11 year olds interest
the dava changes that for me
this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
they shipped in less time than expected
i have two of these stands the electric guitarbass version and the acoustic version
highly recommended also fits on my guitar stand very cool
now it doesnt worksame day i got it
this pick is great highly recommended
the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy
if youve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean
sure the od is there but it isnt worth losing your tone is it
now its become a permanent member of the front of my desk
the same is true for every note
price is right for sure
purple ones with the turtle500 on them
the last two of these that i have owned met untimely deaths
it is alder and hefty but durable
this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance
you have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere
i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit
seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width
supports a lot of weight
some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but ive had no problems with mine
its light and has great sound for interviews
perfect all the way around
this is one great piece of equipment
low to the ground so balance is not an issue
i give them a thumbs up
but it might have if i had not broken its fall
but with a little trial and error i figured it out
i bought two of these one for each of my sons 12 and 14
this is a really strong capo
warehouse deals are not such good deals
i bought this guitar in 2005
i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price
there are better options out there for something portable
so far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough
love it and have one in every case
you can tune all strings in same time
i have a electric bass guitar and needed to capo
look at the price because this thing really sounds good
the key to the onespot is the 1700ma output
this thing is a tank
the look and feel of this cable is excellent
sounds much better than listening to the pcs normal puny speakers
speaking of those knobs they seem a little rickety
the cordoba is much nicer
it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel
recommended if you wantneed a nice little bag of fender mediums
there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking
dont even think about it
i have used these without any problems whatsoever
i ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends
i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely
for 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar
the pickup is very over sensitive
he said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great
it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying
these heavy gauge are the main strings i use
get yours while you can at this price
second both straps were not adjustable to 5934
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace
plus nothing could beat its price so get it
i am very satisfied with my purchase
buy it use it and be happy
if you are doing more than just fingerpicking you might want to add pickshield
will be updating when i get the vintage 12ax7 tube replacement
its hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect
i had never used strap locks before and dont think i will again
im a cheapskate and i cant go back to cheap strings
and the noiseless feature is priceless
from the looks of it it complements the instrument well
notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock
the capo looks nice and works without any problem
one of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage
these are not going to unwind on you or break easily
they fit perfectly on my schecter hellraiser
use the cloth often to polish my guitar
this headstand works like a charm
i returned this one early
i use it to cradle my electric guitar it works beautifully
do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings
they fit on the athm50 headphones
no foot pedals or expensive addons until you really have to have them
but then i read how you use it and all that
holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you
some case manufacturers have the same problem
there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time
for the money it costs it worth it
kk you have a convert in me
same with the sm 58es58
thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars
this is where the balance control is very helpful
but they said they love it
there are ways to improve the offtheshelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately
holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording
they are clueless arrogant and condescending
perfect for my line 6 75 wt
i think youll be pleasantly surprised and you sure cant beat the price
i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing
purchased to provide professional level io for recording from mixers etc
i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself
the onboard monitor volume and headphone is fantastic
great all around mic used for vocals
they have good sound quality
no more couch and kitchen chairs for me
these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment
sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or halfstep higher
they are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems
behringer hit a home run with this one
as long as your hands dont sweat a lot youll be fine with these
a solid favorite around my house
ive used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count
probably good for strumming but not good for lead
very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful
this one has a great display  full colour and easy to read
update  this pedal has since been returned
i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results
simply plug it in and find the right drivers
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability
i am now on my second set of strings and i am hooked
they are suitable for rock punk country and funk
the bullet is nice but i outgrew it
i really cant say enough positive things about the apogee jam
im a professional musician playing 68 times a month
i ordered three of these
makes me wonder how ever played without them
for direct recording it does
high gain settings even something basic like a marshall jcm900 were practically unusable
it also works great for a guitar
anyway besides that they seem to be decent enough quality
the action was a little high for my taste
i wasnt all that happy with this strap connected to a les paul
built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient
i love my snark sn5 tuner
they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place
and such a good price
i use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary
they glisten when he uses this to polish them
besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe
also the xlr connectors are of the highest quality
im more than happy with it but just dont know what else to add
if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal
lately ive become enamored of thekala kaubassfs solid mahogany ubass  fretted
this mic fits my studio need perfectly
its so much warmer than the boss
havent used this one yet
these are my favorite picks to play with
the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs
even the packaging it cool
only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz
pretty well in tune up the neck
i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and 4 acoustics
update 3112 so far so good
the bad monkey overdrive pedal does not produce crazy train metal distortion
i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical
a musthave for your guitarbassukulele bag
this mixer has great audio
i lost one already so now i have 9
by the way i have a gdec 30 for sale
that being said its still a very good pedal
that said the digitech express xt is a little better
its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain
its easy to use and see
it did work for awhile
when this product appeared to be defective i contacted the seller
i bought it myself as a kind of experiment
tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides
some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly
it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and wellmade
note  the music stand easily detaches from the adjustableangle part for storage
it takes up a very negligible amount of space
i will only every buy herc stands from now on
almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials
windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver
easy to adjust with a bit of practice
try them out and make your own decision
it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz
the tone is clear and bright
i used it and i like it
other than that ive had no problems
i wish there was a fine pivotangle adjustment to orient harp to mouth
this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments
the price its about right
i usually have a guitar on it all the time
best strap available for the price
no problems with case or pedals
so i like to play with thin gauge picks
it can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory
definitely try this before you buy it
they sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull
for the future i am not so sureabout me
the transparent rubber piece does the same job
i like this very much and may well buy another
sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics
a new battery didnt resurrect it
after stringing them up  tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded
you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it
its a tipnegative polarity and the privia requires a tippositive polarity
go with it and get a set of these
have tons of picks  but seem to use this one all the time
we both seem pretty happy with it
no its not the most amazing phase pedal but its still quality
they cost more than the mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow
others found this to be true too
what can i say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal
unfortunately it was the wong switch
manufacture said its for practice to me it serves the purpose
action is adequate for practicewith a little tweaking its actually good
the bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut
i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires
these are well made and dont strip when screwing in for the first time
mxr make pretty good pedals for the money
it does what a guitar tuner should do
head era korn comes to mind for me
anyway that is the view from where i sit
for the fender stat it works just great
this pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy
i just tried them just to try
that would be a mistake
at that price its a steal
they look nice and are easily worth their selling price
the string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns
our second week and all is well
they lasted 3 years and i play nearly every day for hours
i suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version
it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar
simple and easy to use easy to carry around
the sound quality complaints are no joke
the oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl
perfect fit  they look great
i have not had one fail on me ever
does what it is supposed to do
just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
i thought id try something different just to see the differences
second elixir phospher bronze last was daddario
pick it up and carry it around itll come apart and scratch your stradivarius
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works
i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations
i bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice
i bought epiphone cases for all of them
only time will tell how well the soldering is
now anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise
with that said this thing sounds amazing directly after install
if your budget is below that dont bother and save more
this is the capo to get
the controls are accessible and easy to adjust
these are the best cables for the money
maybe its just a matter of finding the right place to put it
its kind of an 34empty34 sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects
is it worth the money
for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems
as for design i dont buy the german innovation advertising line from behringer
this is heavy but strong
great pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through
its probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes
they dont make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible
this 4oz bottle will go a long way
price cant be beat either
i use this microphone mainly to record music
only thing i regret is not getting one sooner
although my overdrive sounds good
if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues
this of course doesnt have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing
used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started
overall this is good but not great
sounds just like an amp in your headphones
4 for these 12 beautiful premium quality picks is a steal
i dont know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached
the celluloid one fell apart quickly so i wanted a better material
for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track
unfortunately im going to have to return it
i stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good
nice to see something well made for a change
in fact i highly recommend biyang whenever somebody asks about it
i dont like the direction the dunlop faces it seems awkward
use a shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing
ive bought three of these now and plan to buy more
i have an maudio black box which had a peculiar size plug
this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat
as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird
it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties
i think it is reasonably priced as well
i let him kick that pedal on and off all night
i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again
it uses one cr2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included
update   i just saw that this capo is eligible for amazon prime
they last with great tone for a reasonable time and dont break
is a microthin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string
bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc
73 for acoustic and the same holds true
but what is the point if it is so much inferior
good quality and thik cussion
fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers
fast response on all strings including the low b on several five string basses
we got this one for my wifes mandolin
lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body
is easy on the plating and very gentle
heavy duty and nice looking
most advice ive seen says try em all and decide for yourself
for the price these cant be beat
i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature
the most important part of video is the audio
thanks for the very thorough review mike
if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy
its nice having all of the tools on one device
they keep you guitar safe from falling
the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish
but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume
what can i say these are great patch cables
really a major chore to get over a strap button
i can just quick release it when im done
i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes
and the price was right too
so dont want 9s and 10s too tight then 95s it is
thanks it does what its meant to do
i give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated
the welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job
im an irishstyle dadgad guitarist
at home or on the go i cant see the need for another tuner
the differences here between the sn8 and sn1 are quite noticeable
this is the one you want
yeah go look that up
i would recommend it to anyone
works great with my new mixer
if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap
i love this guitar strap button
does all i need it to do
you pay twice as much in a store
the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist
ive run my strat tele and taylor t5 through this
it does what is supposed to and it doesnt have a cheap look
easy to adjust with reversible mallets
it has a sticker that says made in china
i sound like a rock star with it
i was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself asap
i use these at parties and they work good for the price i paid
survived a trip in a moving van from philly to boston
its worth it if youre not in a hurry
not sure what to do now
after piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner
i tried martin strings once and hated them
keeps my case at a nice 6070 humidity
as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means
this is a big help at rehearsals
just forget about trying to use the display
unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners
it fits so well in my hands and feels great
as another guy said 34not better not bad simply different34 its true
its just another example of tc hitting it out of the park yet again
now if only all windscreens were this sturdy id be a happy customer
ive used hosa for years they have never let me down
thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping
the tuning is deadon and couldnt be more convenient
it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone
word word word word word word word word word word
the cord is reliable and clean sounding
super great sound and super long life
i have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years
too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle
i like those better and theyre cheaper
you cant beat the price
sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo
i will tell you my wah pedal story
the effect is there then its not
powers up to five 9v effects using one power supply
cheaper ones will work but i wanted to try it out
good upgrade for my squier deluxe strat
i just ordered another set for my strat hss
impressively clear recordings unlike any ive been able to obtain using aplantronics
with all the other great reviews noted here i decided to buy this guitar
plus they are all padded afor protection
these arent too heavy not too light
still if youre looking a softerthanplastic pick this is the one to get
i used this on my last stratocaster build
nothings worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple
i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices
stop waiting and grab one you cant go wrong
it may not be a 5star intrument but its a 5star value
the muff is a lot more noisy
will do the job of good protection
i own a piece of the legend and music history
it isnt completely black though
it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed
soon i will be in the market for an upgrade
i use to use a cloth to clean my strings
i play morning noon and night
i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar
these patch cords work like a champ
i had to send my first one back
i dont know why they are called big stubby
this is a really amazing portable midi keyboard
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound
the gig bag is a square and softly padded
i have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it
they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand
it definitely stands up to their reputation
when using with a computer but they dont
i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over
that being said i havent found anything i cant use it on
im not sure how its possible
so think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional
i just got it and tried it out
the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way
its warm and the modulation sounds great
if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups esp
best deal and does the job
the extortion here is almost monster cable like
also it not to big
i bought this cable for my bands live show setup
i was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size
if it rocks the fingerboard is radiused
being see through distracts me
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect
they feel and sound great when you play them
can tune up quickly every time
i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received
this is a great pedal
i can say its built much better than i thought it would be
it is small enough to be out of the way while playing
i didnt like it cause of the squealing
its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more
and it matches my tweed amp
so i suggest you to use the power adapter
i got this on sale from gc for 80 shipped plus 7 tax arrrgh
it was an exceptional guitar for which i paid 125
however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate
for the price u cant go wrong
for the price this is a steal
i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar
it was even sorta in tune
unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item
avoid if you can spend more
i drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit
34quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations
no trouble stringing or tuning either set
some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway
buy the 20w version which is plenty loud for home
i knew i did right by buying the dr212
want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay
with this my voice is strong and clear
like all boss pedals its as sturdy as a little truck
the bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised
but had no idea if this would be as good as all that
im really happy with this daddario purchase
they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds
i dont know why more people dont use these  theyre amazing
its not an entire bridge assembly but its exactly what i needed
my only small 34concern34 is the length of the arm itself
the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though
this little fellow is great
easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service
the vibe sound doesnt get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2
nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle
it cuts the medal strings like butter
the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings
it winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter
seems well made for the price and works as advertised
ive been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin
id even pay a lot more for them
as far as amps that model vintage tones
also i like the first day of new strings look shiny
the free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter
when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill
i purchased these to use with my mandolin
i wanted the tales of brave ulysses sound so i went with this
not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out
this is an excellentsounding pickup
i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head
havent noticed any hum or crackles
not much to say about a guitar strap
a little pricey but probably worth it
i would have much better liked it if they were metal
it goes from slapback to space shot very easily
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
i like the grippiness of them
very flexible but solid feel to it
every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me
my thumbs arent tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average
ill definitely be buying more of these
i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc
only five watts yes but thats still enough to fill a room
would recommend this to anybody
i find it handy useful and i recommend it
youll like this stuff better than anything youve used to date
the price is really good
i cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up
aquila seems to be the most popular now
all three of them have held up with no issues
the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface
i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect
it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose
these strings from daddario are a personal favorite of mine
i find myself wishing i had ordered more
they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups
i purchased this case for my newline 6 pod hd 500
i didnt need the fx
durability wise ill lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out
set your guitar down on it by accident when its plugged in and
stable and precise pick attack
maybe not the best but it serves its purpose
there really is nothing not to like about this pedal
lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors
they are 8020 and i prefer those to the other strings out there
im very happy i bought them
well padded lots of good pockets does all that it should
otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel
this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap
if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava
its especially perfect for garage and bar bands
they also last quite a long time maybe 7 months
these are one of the best strings ive used
youll know its on by the tone change and the bright led light
this is an all metal exc
controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on
excellent rack screws with washers
great picks for beginners and pros alike
very well made and durable
im using it karaoke online in paltalk
if you need it theres enough wiring to have space between your pedals
tuner is right on overdrive seems fine
it is one of the best value i have purchased
but my mexistrat is now complete
you cant blame a chicken for not quacking properly
it was a direct replacement for the original
just finished setting it up
its so dim i can barley see the reading when i squint
this capo comes with a pick holder
plus ill get another one in a different color
the string cleaner is nice too
it gets thumbs up for the soundprice ratio
summaryacoustic sounds 34ok34 but noisy in weird ways
i like the  setting the best
the behringers go for 15000 while the mackies go for about 25000
the best xlr cables you can find
i received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar
not so good outside if there is a fair breeze
it also occasionally fails to register at all
ive seen and used some better cables but not at this price point
maybe behringer 3031as or something
they dont feel as secure as the schaller locks
what the hot tubes does is anything but 34familiar34 from an affordable od pedal
fender heavies what more needs to be said
i also like the tone a lot
2nd updatetried out several compatible tubes
first a word about the negative reviews
this one for my new ovation 12 string cc245 is what i needed
i would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel
and thats all ive got to say about it
theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands
never had one go scratchy
the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes
i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it
so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something
leave it in your car to practice at lunch
if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment
for what this does you cant go wrong for the price
but it really does the job good tone
foot switches are easy to use
i have not experienced the tonesuck or buzzing that others have complained about
another issue with the ca40 is the poor screen
screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use
not a huge deal but a consideration
it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus
a must for any gigging guitarist
the color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color
what are you waiting for
it does exactly what i needed it for
this is a good guitar for the price
depends on what your looking for
for the price you cannot go wrong with this
i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily
most tremolos have it but not all
i have tried few picks textured mallow color and this bright green
the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard
i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation
the mxr phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units
38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these
and if you know the g chord you will have lots of fun
best recommended for starters intermediate and pro player
the curly cable has fared much better
they provide you with an activation code after you register
on the positive action and intonation good
this would work fine for drummers
it really put yout guitar in tune
the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase
if it does break has a lifetime warranty
the exl110bt strings are about 500 a set
it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening
cover them with a sheet or something
buy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny
lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteries
i have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my strats
first it a great price  about the same as a big mac lol
i received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar
fender original parts cant be beat
they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackityclack noise
ive had this for several years
it is very mobile easily adjustable sturdy and durable
crisp tone distinction is just not there
ok  i like this one a lot
cant even tell if it is on or off
i have a wide variety of vic sticks that i bought here on amazon
gotta love these strings that just wanna sing
this is the first strap that ive bought in a long time
now i have more confidence with this strap
we bought the pylepro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma230
maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action
this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it
i bought mine from austin bazaar
still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy
fits nicely into my acoustic guitars
definitely the best looper ive come across
very solid build never felt cheap in any way
im completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it
you can never go wrong with a kyser
these are descent quality cables
otherwise i really like this harmonica
the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp
you will only get a muddy garbled mess
for me it sounded better than sm58
they do what they are meant to do
the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing
my problems with it are 3 fold   1
highest quality guitar ive ever seen in this price range
it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly
so i gave this to him to save some time
its always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place
for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better
a few more inches would have been appreciated
by now in contrast i would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise
these just did not perform as expected
at least not with the mic boom there
there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range
comes with a velvet pouch and dvd
id rather lose one of these behringers than a 58
i use carbon zinc batteries in mine
accurate little accessory only works with guitars
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks
i was not happy the super champ x2 didnt come with it
once i added other pedals there became a horrible hum
overall i think this capos a winner
doesnt short out on you
or adult bottled beverage while playing
to your guitar amp or from it
i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it
its soft and rubbery feeling and wont scratch your guitar
find a youtube video to see all of its potential
will keep on the side for next guitar
i bought two more today
its a very noncolored sounding overdrive
not special but not disappointing either
nice strap but a bit too stiff
and it required some dremelingsanding to get it to sit correctly
more than my other guitars again not a pro
it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer
too bad they made this decision imo
i urge you to purchase if you are looking
everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings
these plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for
you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters
dont buy the high rated chrome capped ones i had problems with those
for the price id expect a more durable product
i like the tone of daddarios 8020 bronze strings
a nobrainer for fender guitars
it was a toy not an instrument
it is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs
i wasnt expecting it to be this nice
for the price you cant complain
highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar
comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters
this power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals
34why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually
hands down my absolute favorite pick
these have worked great when ive needed to have 14 input vs the xlr
the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand
i spent a lot of time on amazon reading reviews  comparing prices
if you bought rocksmith 2014 and use an electric guitar get this
still they play so well its worth the cost of regular replacement
blue tape both sides as to prevent marring
i had to sand it down some in all directions
it has higher quality and the dials feel solid
it has a green led and large mark for being on target
it works as it should and does well
that did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids
i keep it in my guitar case and use it often
they have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see
maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean
someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than i did
you dont want your instrument plummeting to the floor
ive been happy with all of gls products so far
i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size 8
i have these on all my guitars and always will
but these seemed to work well on the guitar i was restringing
i would suggest the snark sn1
for this review i used the services of my supermusician friend mike
nice tone and good quality
for 50 im very impressed
these are great for all around playing
50 and thicker in case youre looking for very thin ones
ive had two of these tuners
the big name delay i replaced  in all honesty  wasnt as good
in my opinion this is the best guitar volume pedal available
well you get the picture
i have yet to buy another set of strings
there is another review here where the user states they didnt receive enough velcro
if you hate droping your pick while playingget these
it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces
i didnt notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported
other than that when you need 1032 rack screws these are the real mccoy
but you dont have to take my word for it
i bought this stand to mic a kick drum
works great  keeps all my fretboards looking great
the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed
the capo does what its does
ive been using this for roughly a year now and it works fine
this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings
i bought two sets 6 total great cables no added hum
i like playing it too
when the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works
it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured
the tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones i can find
count on fender to give u a good product
my capo could not even hold them
that having been said im pleased with them as a string for guitar practice
dont botherit doesnt mute the strings at all
im an amateur musician so im on and off on playing
they arent that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter
i am also looking at the zoom h1 which will come out in sept
im old school when it comes to these boxes
all and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference
a must have for any folk player
i only paid 299 which is simply an outstanding deal
i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic
the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys
fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great
i own hundreds of picks
i use light daddaro strings and love the tone and feel
i would not recommend it
it has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks
a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses
i found that a palms width from the tip of the mic works best
this is a cool little amp
here are the reasons  solidly made everything is high quality
repeating the process yielded identical results
i just looked at pics on the net and got them close
the bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there
if youre hemming and hawing over getting one just do it
this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner
nice microphone stand for the cost
this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes
very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range
installation is not rocket science
dont play another show without these
this strap is value for money
they tuned right up with very little stretching
it is lined and has a pouch for song books
this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul
with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking
extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems
the material its made of is good and it holds the guitar
i would purchase them again
8020 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out
further more do i stick with the same brand
all dimarzio products are incredible
it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case
again i feel line i work for dunlop
they just rob your tone
out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase
ive heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results
simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding
good for fast strumming etc
never had one unscrew again
been using these for years
with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff
also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other two
the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful
i wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar
the wire cutters also work really well
it definitely worked a lot easier than the untreated microfiber cloth
they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it
despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use it
i found the mic tuner isnt as accurate
they all work well are well constructed and are a good value
students would be especially encouraged to get one of these
the craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb
got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this
much easier  you dont need to select your tuning or anything first
the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend 90100usd for a tuner
so far the tuner is very accurate
strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils
but thats not a problem any more either
i dont play these myself i bought them for my daughter
i often use my electric guitar unplugged
since i paid about 13 for this i was not expecting a great deal
this has an output of 300 milliamps
otherwise its a good idea
ill likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts
when laying empty it is 50 long x about 12 wide and lays flat
i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar
works great seems durable shipped fast
some other mxls like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end
i will report back after three months
no need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters
i was really worried about scuffing it up
best packaging i have seen and for the price dont order just one pack
the controls are volume off tone and overdrive
ive only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well
it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear
this is not a distortion petal like the boss ds1 or metal zone mt2
really a remarkable microphone for around 100
i used this product and it really soaked it up fast
he is another cool use for this pedal
what a great multipurpose guitar tool
proof of this lies in the boss unit i have owned for 20 years
i have one in my main guitar caseses
the smell of this guitar is also amazing
this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range
this device sounds okay its usable
ive been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel
will buy it again in the future
this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
this was another filler item for a much larger order
wish i had sized them before i bought them
still it works and was inexpensive
the red color looks nice
i would rather concentrate on making music
edit  6 months later and its dead already
this tuner blows away my old guitar professorqwik tune tuner
this string winder is adequate but not really solid
it also makes you looks professional
these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing
well this cable certainly didnt last long as the title says 8 weeks
thank u guys your pedals really kick butt
at the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up
i am pleased with it
i have two of these now and they may be my favorite
glad i got this one
very comfortable in the hand
cables even good ones eventually break
you must have one of these
maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain
slow and fast position on the trigger for more control
for the price its definitely worth it imho
turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock
runs a little bit on the hot side
i have an older model that i still use also
pedal is not working it just making noise
i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely
it does do what is supposed to do
it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it
jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cutout
i figured id save a bit and get a couple more from amazon
this gig bag is well worth the price
i bought this as for practice
its simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality
they are wellmade easy to play guitars
i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping
fast forward a few years and i purchase this little baby on a whim
both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker
i get a much higher output  much better response and much better sound
at the current price at the time of this review its a bargain
instead of hammering it out i used two screwdrivers to pry it out
it is small and incredibly light weight you almost cant tell that its there
most work by using a small builtin microphone that picks up sound waves
these strings sound nice and you cant go wrong with the price tag either
the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use
im really happy with this and would replace it god forbid
then this will make transporting it easy
overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs
lolyou will need a 1532nd drill bit to complete the install
the sound is not as crisp
if you are thinking about buying this product do it
this is not a bad product just not great
affordable and comes in many colors
if you want great strings get fender strings
it really seems well engineered and made of quality material
they send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
works as intended and maybe more
i have reviewed this before
but this will be my go to bluesrock pedal for quite some time
great for amateur vocal recording like me
i worry the battery will fall out very easily
sounds great on amps and perc
my verdict  awesome  it sounds just like i remember
purchased for my epiphone electric guitar
im glad i did because its really great
it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe
easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path
i bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases
these should last a lifetime barring any physical damage
ive been recording using garage band
i highly recommend this strap
i have 2 70w 1234 amps and a big fender dsp 212
this is a great mic
can be folded for easy transport
thats like the only downside i can think of
if you need something more accurate i recommend investing in a good pedal
many seem to complain about the plastic housing but im fine with it
tones bands specific songs sounds
i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo
okay back to the explanation
works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio
i cant believe what you can get for the price on this one
this fender cable is the perfect length for me
in that regard i give it five stars
if i could make one i would
the detailsthe amp itself is tiny
we live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals
thank you fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size
but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new
bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor
i have a few planet waves products and i can safely recommend them
im not a professional but have been playing for many many years
i purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear
this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and doubleleather ends
this hanger was very easy to install
best clip on tuner i have ever purchased
my guitars sustain was definitely improved with this nut
i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago
tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well
i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp
it is very responsive to pressure
it took a long time to come
every guitarist needs a good tuner
im so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool
but as far as sound they are great
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion
oh by the way i have an s6 for sale
no for the nuts and bolts of the thing
so at least between these two i found no total differences
my initial impression was somewhat mixed
i thought why not try a 2 in 1 formulation
easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip
thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings
mine was still brand new to me and worked really well
great customer service and love the pics
i wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didnt
if it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick
i had them on my yamaha fg700s
great durable foam contact points for cradling baby
it is certainly an easy change
ive never been disappointed by the quality
a consideration  this is suede and will fuzz for the first little while
i put a heil fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax
a bargain at the offered price
the headphone amp was of particular concern for me
theyre better in a thicker size 10mm or larger but the
if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software
either that or theyre comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue
the stand is very stable and works well
you cant necessarily go wrong with knobs
i just bought a rickenbacker 4003 that came with schaller strap locks preinstalled
build quality 45i did have 1 problem with the high e tuner
now its right where i can find it everytime
works if you keep it with instrument in your case and upkeep is minimal
the package was really well don e and arrived in good time
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars
great mount for the price
these cables are just what i hoped they would be
i managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck
would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice
made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound
these mics are the best mic for the buck out there
i also got black knobs as well
i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best
musicians gear tubular guitar stand black pair is a good deal for musician
ive never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few
both sound good but these last a couple weeks longer
the strings had a good feel to them as well
this is my first petal of  any kind
for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks
please refer to my review of cakewalk music creator 6 here on amazoncom
i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well
the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble
i debated between this one and the other popularslightly more expensive one
solidly built works just as a mic stand should
this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop
put it on the headstock
also its a vintage style not a mid 80s mosquito tone killing device
i cant let on what ive done to mine because
ridiculous setup but ive save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that
cant reccomend it enough especially considering the price
in this respect its like an mxr 6 band
its better in every way than the ny reissue
this is a great stand for your violin or viola
yes this pedal is made of plastic
you get what you pay for
maybe its just me but thats how they come across
we use it to hold the musics and dont need to turn the head
will definitely make any uke sound great
only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar
works exceedingly well for any use
i going to see if i can return them for store credit
60 dunlop tortex is perfect
these strings softened the tone which i wasnt looking to do
if you can afford it the peterson is the best clipon tuner out there
however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp
i like many things about this tuner
if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by bossroland
dont spend 200 on a boutique pedal  get this one
i know i often do
black tortex picks with silver lettering
it works perfectly with my sound card
received promptly and tested out with acousticelectric guitar
will this even work on a 6string bass
i leave it on my guitar all the time
i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail
the cables are flexible quiet and no pops or loss of signal
tons of bang for your buck
in some situations they can be a savior during set up
it will save you a fortune
5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales
bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products
most of the b pedals work quite well
it looked great and felt solid
i use the dunlop tortex 114mm purples
i have never had a hosa go bad on me
a much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers
it probably wont protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack
your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings
not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there
so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least
bottom line this is my favorite headstock tuner
this device is the best you can buy
forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand
they work great  you cant beat the price
perfect perfect size weight shape
so it may not work in some configurations
the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well
you really cant go wrong here
it is consistent easy to use and compact
strike a note once and its sharp
a peghole reamer might have done a better job but i didnt have one
if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss
you really cant go wrong with this pamonitor
compact design on stand and folding for travel
no buzzes no hums no nonsense
the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand
i had a hard time lineing them up to install
overall i rely on daddario strings for all my instruments
ive reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them
thats at the 25 gain setting
they work well and sound amazing
paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal
im sure ill be using the crybaby for the rest of my music life
the tool is extremely useful
the cutter snips the strings with no effort
folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag
i like to use different gage picks therefore
well they were right it sucks
i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay
for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so
if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic
this product is a must
youll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches
i have little experience with tube voodoo
this strap is very comfortable
from experience it never hurts to have extra picks around
first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression
they dont taste like grapes however
this single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects
i purchased this to use with my old yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele
really nice piece of equipment for a small price
for what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of you cant beat it
i have used these strings since they first came out
also the pedal just started oscillating a few times
on its tallest setting this gives me the exact height i need
i have tried other picks like this that had points which went as confortable
tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available
their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover
the screen could be a little brighter
then i saw this one
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
i am revising my previous review on the 3250ls
different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use
this little amp packs tons of tone  sound
seen these and they work great when needed
i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember
its a great intro model not just for ipads
im on my second us600 pedal after the first one broke
probably not but so what
its a great cable for the price
i have been playing for 9 years
a budget this is your mic
it holds up the guitar
worked perfectly for my latest guitar project
also i read a review bout it not fitting some guys lp
this is a must have
great for vocals and guitar
i bought this for quality ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live
as far as battery life goes you can get them right on amazon
however this worked fine as a plain tuner
these picks are great the best part is the 72 pack
the two violins we ordered came on time and were packaged very well
very happy with it considering the price point
fresh strings do sound better
this one fills the bill pretty well
when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner
i got this at an awesome price too
has a 14in jack to easily plug into a guitar amp
no issues in that regard with the fatso
this little box will give it to you
there are both xlr and trs inputs on the back
you wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick
i use it with audacity
they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot
finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem
great deal for the money
i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking
cheap stuff a budget brand trying to pass as a name brand
i could not believe it
although the machine itself is good the accompanying documentation is awful
regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book
i love this cable they look good and are well made too
these cans were decent back when they were just above 100 bucks
the screen is also very bright and easy to read
i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good
for a ten spot ya cant do better
just not a fan of the cheap shiny plastic versions
i occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls
it is usable for applications like speaking
but you cant expect to just plug it in and go
the other two tuners dont have this issue
it sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords
all in all a very nice bargain
i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass
works well with my stuff
maybe those folksshould shell out an additional 300 for something better
no problems at all with this product
forget about all the presets
just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings
really should be 1434 mono or stereo
it does the perfect job for podcasting as well as gameplay videos
this is a great guitar strap for the money
i recommend this to anyone with an astyle mandolin
keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size
they should last 34 months  you dont do anything else
nothing gimmicky or faulty just perfect
this thing is like a magic spray
i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this
011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil
it holds my jazz bass without any problem
maybe they will last longer
the tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough
however these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly
the lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured
surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable
to compare this i tried a g7 capo kaiser and schubb
theyre a whole new world
dislikes   quality of chinese products is a crap shoot
this is a well made low noise and low cost cable
i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much
however once i opened it i discovered an undamaged snark tuner inside
it pays to shop around
makes it look really smart
so far so good not perfect but good
anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane
great guitar companies dont always make or sell under their aegis the best strings
id recommend this over the larger tubular type
these things are great and yes i can shred faster now
this product is straight forward and works as its intended
it may just be my style
its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass
thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar natural
it also lubes your strings
i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well
thats how much he payed
btw this seller really got these to me fast
a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made
according to the ad copy this pedal replicates fullstack marshall crunch
so thanks to amazon for making this possible
they sound great and last forever
and i like those strings better
the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero
the cleans are warm and
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way
my acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand
i figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze
i will definitely buy more of these in the future
many options settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile
i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china
the alpha is a great little interface
so this was a birthday gift to myself
it uses stock os drivers that loaded right up
this seems like a nice product but maybe im doing something wrong
these didnt show up so i contacted amz which goes back to godps
it is a 5star product
wow these cables are made really sturdy
they look great it is indeed real ebony with a pearl inlay
tilts to match personal requirement
so far i am very impressed
042or save some money and go withdaddario exl120 electric guitar strings super light 942
i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars
i havent used expensive rack units etc
who couldnt use an extra arm or two when moving equipment
just clip it on about the nut and tune away
but overall this is a great guitar
it does what its supposed to do
10232012  still holding up well
the strings are nice and smooth and springy very easy to press on
i use this with my audio technica condensor
it gets the job done
providing the brackets to mount
it works as well as expensive tuners
overall this is a pretty good stand
now i have 8 channels of automation  stop back record play etc
has a headphone out with volume control plug and play
i only use 34 pedals and this is always one of them
this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle
i have bought several of their models
this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide
i have been playing guitar since i was 14 years old
i have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio
you can read my verypositive review on the epiphone on amazon
it is not variable speed
pay attention to the warnings
i would not have been able to do that without this amp
these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them
for the price i feel like it is a steal
i have several guitars and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar
dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument
dont get me wrong though i still like these
it is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely
i have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars
the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow
you use a average weight mic or4
picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound
seems like a nice pedal
i bought this strap for my taylor guitar
a little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it
right size well made and these do the job
of course if it can accurately handle 8s it will breeze through anything thicker
i bought this based on video reviews on the net
now after a couple of months i want to say
ive been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar
i will have to replace it soon
its a classic rock pedal that screams
when i am plugged in i dont move around a lot
just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you
2 the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged
it may be a challenge to assemble it
the one that shipped was the cheaper shiny plastic one
they last forever and have a great grip
i keep one at home and just ordered another one for school
snark tuners have always performed well for me
that song along should keep my practicing for a long time
i like the black side and the soft leather side
plug it in and its ready to go
its large and takes up space on my pedal board
foldsup pretty compact for travel
it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers
i got the 50 standard black on black case
i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug
great stand for the price
i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables
its an excellent overdrive and an incredible value
or so the historical theory goes
ok so i just installed these things for my krk 6s no stands
i play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great
so i worked on my technique some more
but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less
i like a cheese pizza
for the price you cant go wrong
dont drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves
it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great
i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals
much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage
there are better out there but its a good value
the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic
they last forever and do not lose the strong holds
this little tuner does the job
the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong
i can say its pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer
theyre very thin nylon picks
ten bands is a little overkill for guitar
so dont buy it expecting overdrive
however it is handy for short solos
for the ts pedals in this price range its the most useful
about the same tension as 9s on a strat
i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player
or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background
with large fingers like mine it almost disappears
this one is the worst
this pad is great for midi vstis drums queuing and its got great action
these things last forever for someone who only plays casually
i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues
i play guitar mandolin and ukelele
they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible
this stuff is the best bargain on the market
these replaced the etb92 nylon tapewounds i tried
im glad i dont need to stuck with this anymore
you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low
it has two brightness settings
it does its job reliably and well
these cables are just poorly thought out
if you are looking at this guitar buy it
this saved med at least 40 instead of getting a traditional preamp
after all thats 2 more strings than its intended purpose
they really help me out and they are a cheap price
just not my cup of tone thats all
it will put the sound down
so if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration
i would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both
ok im surprised that this unit is now over 1500
for the price why not
oh ya the grip is perfect
tutsplus dot comtutorialsbeginnersguidetoacoustictreatmentaudio1274 just replace the dot
88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues
i am using it for a dj karaoke system i do recommend it
the ditto is so easy
so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick
good height comfortable id buy it again no questions asked
the strings are with out a doubt real fender strings
holds my picks in place  nicely
i admit i havent had it long but so far so good
0 6 7 9 and 12 are amazing voices
i have a barber ltd which does that beautifully
whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true
extremely versatile and as is typical with all boss pedals absolutely sturdy
i agree with all the other reviews
i went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times
i like the look of it as well as the lightweight feel
very happy going to order more
this capo is worth the price
they have an industry standard packaging
mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat
shipping was free it arrived in under 1 week from ordering
the provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming
i prefer no cheap imitations
i love these  picks  im  defintley getting some more
the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal
back plate has a greenish tint and is single ply not 3ply as advertised
i have many microphones and this compares to the 50
easy to install and use and very reasonable price
im mounting it to a heavy duty on stage brand double x stand
i am trying to learn a few slide riffs
definitely not the strings though
im not sure how you would wear it out really
this feature alone makes it a musthave for taking full advantage of the amp
and works well for it
its just really good and clear and powerful
this was exactly what i was after
getting he harmonica unto te springloaded holder can be a bit tricky
and little it is not much bigger than the jack
highly recommended by all serious ukulele players
use it every week at gigs
these are better and screw in
when i mentioned light duty in the title i truly meant it
both of them sound like there was no capo on
at less than 15 you need to be able to look past these things
some models suffer fits in certain situations
thats not pedal board friendly in my opinion
ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day
and the thing is loud
this is not a bad way to get started playing with that
retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied
it only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy
im not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagonwheel
this does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment
put this through an ac30c2 and prepare to be amazed
excellent bass response not muddy at all tight mids and clear highs
ive only ever dropped an instrument that had strap locks on it
going from manual patchlevel to banklevel is awkward
there is a big drop in the freq
this mic is really nice
i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldnt be happier
one reviewer wrote that it is a very lowlow
ive owned this pedal for about 8 years
i did find a solution
this is simply the best power supply out there
i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great
i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome
ill also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision
what about the stock pick guard
very serviceable easy to use sturdy
truly a unique and versatile creation
when i first installed these strings i wasnt too impressed
plugged it in worked first time no problems
i see no flaws on my banjo
looks like it is holding up so far
i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar
the angle does the job
i play a tele and an acoustic martin
i want them to last longer
i have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time
under 10 wouldve been better
i dont understand the clip for a tuner on this thing
there is also a model made specially for bass
i like these little guys
this works better than the qk10b model by the same company
id buy this again for sure
still its a very good tuner overall
on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series
the first power source that is fun
i have no idea how itll sound with a solid state amp
i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings
also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys
simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear
did not end up using them but will one day
and the ukulele looks so much better now
be sure to get a pop filter to go with it
not the greatest but ok
modulation and delays rocks they sound good
i dont know why some people hate it
i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u2 etc
the ds1 does not warm up the tone in your amp
this dual splitter works perfect
have 2 problems with the strings
if was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood
i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model
this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price
small compact functional and it works
the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well
other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price
i like fender bullets on it
it has low noise clean soundgood transmission
incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes
id love two more ports
it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp30
it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most
ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists
as far as quality these are great
im glad i tried out these daddario strings
this strap button works great
other than that these are great monitors
i got it in red
i could not be more pleased with this product
delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed
i was upgrading all the chrome on a mim and put this on
its cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if youre careful
this came at no surprise
makes the fretboard feel like new but best to clean with alcohol wipes first
these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them
it is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use
the boss dd7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone
also the 34feet34 dont spread as wide apart as id hoped
here are my pros and cons pros1
has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition
limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me
some complained about each band boosting others
the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar
what may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone elses palate
got this for my wife she just loves it
but that is a minor complaint
ive switched over to this design and couldnt be happier with it
there is no need for proprietary or expensive strap locks
just make certain you get the height correct so your action isnt too high
ive given it a 3 star merely out of respect for hohner
the contrast helps you see what your doing
the coating is much heavier than that of other strings
i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel
first off im no ukulele expert
you could make it work
in 23 years my tastes may change
change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument
so this is more than adequate for daily practice
im not sure how 34on stage34 ready this is
needless to say its not going anywhere
i paid for the entire system
it has no depth to it
not the cheapest but worth the money
these microphones are great for recording vocals
they are excellent quality for the money
the rubber grip area is a joy to hold
it would have 5 stars but for the recent failures
for the price this is a fantastic buy
this is better i think
it fits well where i put it
this one only tunes in the uke keys
however im not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic
have not gigged with it as yet
youll need a new one about every ten years or so
little to no excess residue
steelstring dreadnought archtop jazz box and les paul worked nicely
overall this is well worth the 500 that they list as the msrp
the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison
i also wouldnt recommend it for anyone just starting out
legs open to set up easy
from a construction standpoint these are remarkable for the price point
not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon
bad news   these aquila strings are not standard on some others
warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one
this highjacks your audio defaults in windows
this was an excellent purchase
this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp
that plus the dryupclose characteristic are this mics top selling points
but it was a bit of a pain
i would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze
there is pretty much little to no latency and it isnt noticeable
the midi clock sync implementation is flawed
the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work
once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised
ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars
i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value
i got a couple of these
i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment
i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f335 and they look stunning
i really cant think of anything negative to say about it
first wax i have bought
now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post
needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag
or at least i think so
i love love love these strings
who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place
the 10mm tortex picks are blue
they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks
not much to screw up
ive been using only kyser capos for many years now
might be a little old fashioned but
it recognized the devices presence but it didnt produce any sound on the computer
i then let windows 7 plug  play the drivers no disk needed
this mixer handles it all perfectly
i bought 2 of these about 6 months ago
it went together fast and is well padded
i have made them last up to 2 months
im a bit indifferent to this mod
i think the product should have been around 7080
ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully
im quite disappointed and it sits here with no use
i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments
ii do replace it for guitar cable work fine im happy with this unit
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together
they use the same chip
this little unit is packed with great effects
purchased after another folding stand which cost the same  literally fell apart
the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship
as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say
i buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases
the pencil condenser are questionable
change them its a very quick fix
okay they are not high end but i didnt need high end ones
sometimes it felt a little off but robots know best right
that is if it lasts that long
i bought this after watching a professionallooking youtube demonstration of it
i saw these baby on the road with maroon5s james
the sound from this sg is true to its big brother from gibson
i got mine for use with some behringer mics
it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock
it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet
if this happens to you dont worry
gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether
i cant think of any other pedals ive owned that could do this
strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around
this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought
but other than that works as intended
it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned
i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic
they are great you will love it
i really like the way the tungsol makes my jazzmaster sound
it can do a lot more but its what i wanted
13 strings and well is simply too much
move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune
if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased
but theyve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me
i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass
however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional
i like this one the best
the angle of the tray is not adjustable
that just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time
i have had it for three months now and it is still fine
its important for my playing to not have finger noise
i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock
my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot
the readout is easy to see in any light
i bought it for my church and the drum sounds great
i bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality
you will not be sorry with this purchase
i have owned just about every tuner made
subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing
otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb
best sound on all instruments was obtained from 610 feet using the omni mode
i ordered this as a spare and at this time i havent used it
you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes
must less expensive and just as good as others
i have been playing guitar for over 30 years
i like a rich tone with some high end but without too much 8216klang8217
it proved to be very functional
so far it doesnt look like it will though
always have a few spares that have been tested
they give off such a warm tone and are holding up very well
you can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds
some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has
who doesnt need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right
go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogoogle
at its price point  5 stars
three big ones are the jet sound choralflange and leslie speaker
this purchase is the very reason why im looking to buy a wireless system
and after 30 years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished
in fact i dont think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours
i have other behringer gear and it always works
what did i want for this price anyway
small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading
i will definitely recommend these
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier
it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp
this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid 4999
they are both great pedals that i use all the time
this cup bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water
i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast
the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies
the reason i bought this one was because it was cheap
a decent little 34sized traveler
it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness
the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my fender deluxe reverb amp
our son says its easy to use and has a good sound quality
i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim
if youre a rockgod dont even consider this why would you anyway
sound really nice on my taylor 410ce
much better than plastic ones especially if you stay in the light thickens
grips soft loose and yet well
i enjoy this very much
i do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them
i have played guitar professionally for over 27 years
makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one
hard to say it just indicates high  low  on pitch really
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all
the sn2 senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup
but otherwise a wise and good purchase
this is the most ive ever spent on a guitar strap
i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot
and the price aint so bad either
love it the display is cool and cant ask anything more
so testing on their own mics
its made in germany so it could be taken into battle
its the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly
that said its lovely to see the strings true in
great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking
the sound and tone are great and the price is right
i was really surprised to see how well they sounded
and for the price this is a solid 4 star amp
there were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price
still trying to get the overblow
oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason
that decision was based mostly on price
i arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly
comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal
if you are careful it offers good protection
first of all this is a 40 7guitar stand
he says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality
but it definitely gives you the effect
i believe it was x
the 48 is made in mexico
but if you demand metal get far away
especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable
excellent sound quality much better than any other mic ive used
its like im using actual studio monitors
i already own two and had no problems
the daddarios are excellent strings and this price on the 10pack was unbeatenanywhere
i expect to buy more of these in the future
these would probably better suited to guitarists
if youre purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands
surprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it
the guitar touches the floor
luckily that was no mere marketing jive
the strap and picks were an added bonus
stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials
this kyser will last a long long time
im a small woman and i really like that the neck is smaller
it does the job however
am sure you will too
and all martin products are second to none
i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it
they all work the same
the first things to upgrade are the pickups
promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it
this is such a simple great tuner
it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem
however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely
it gives you great sound for solos
id recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure its secure
a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat
but this seiko is certainly the quickest
it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy
great product for the price
but i dont think youre getting 5x the sound quality
the guitar has such a great ring to it
line in  usb buttons somewhat confusing nonintuitive
i even use it when im drumming
it really makes your guitar shine
but it is still an error in functionality
youll end up saving money over the long haul
ive been using it for nearly a year now
whats the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast
not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great
i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning
this stand is ok for light home use
just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go
it has compression exciter  deesser as well as eq and reverb
well long story short this is my fourth vox wah
works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over
but i stand in front of a mic on stage
excellent product from a fantastic seller
this guitar strap performs as expected for its price
especially if you use tubes
looks pretty neat along with the george ls cables that are almost invisible
were not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitar
these are durable but i get some noise from the cables
ive used my hde pickup for about a month now
i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x2 champ
it accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer
small improvement but not close enough
to be honest i have no idea where this is coming from
this amp is packed with features
im an amateur sound tech
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
each light has multiple independent settings
good replacement for iffy tuners
the rattle just got worse louder as i played
they are light on the fingers sound great and priced right
the original speakers are too hifi sounding for me
easy to use  it is what it is
not perfect but not expensive
too much bass and other garbage
ive even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype
after confirming the guitar was okay i tried a shorter cable which worked fine
does not scratch guitars finish just be careful and no issues
the cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings
you go through batteries like crazy and it doesnt work at all for bass
i have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless
my only complaint is the markings on the level knobs
this stuff honestly works very well
fits in most guitar cases  is lightweight
i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine
when i bought this i though it wouldnt be enough
martin knows what theyre doing
ive not broken one yet and the 1148 is a good gauge
the clips look solid and so far they are solid
i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely
the cutter works great you just have to be careful
i had some issues with this guitar when it arrived
it also arrived super fast
my kid is happy with this strap for his guitar
i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music
it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up
i sprayed on all my guitars
ive tried all 3 types of these and theyre pretty much asadvertised
headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems
im using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement
for the price this is totally worth it
there are a few strange nuances though
at least they wouldnt be able to put together a quality banjo
maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable
that being said it is good for practice and song writing
never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft
its very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without
other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap
i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects
after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube
it does what its designed to do
at first i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss
it must be from a product like this
its also truebypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off
just a warning to those that are picky
i will preface this review by saying that i am no 34audiophile34
i am using it with a musicians gear music stand
i will never switch from the pick
amazon should have clarified in their item description
i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume
at least thats what she told the police
has all the adapters i needed
i like it as the stars say
i tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs
the strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots
elixir strings are great for me
works great right out of the box
the cutter makes this thing really worth while
i am however an electric gitty player primarily
for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build
then see how long you can own it
i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric
jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow
its a good quality great sounding tube
saludos  a todos desde venezuela
it does not sound like that in the recordings though
the headline says it all
fender 351 picks are some of the best picks money can buy
its a well crafted instrument
it was just what i needed to give me clean sound
this analog chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then arent all mic evaluations subjective
they look great and fit perfectly
clips on easily and hold strings down nicely
these guys did a super job getting them here fast
that was good enough to sell me
i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes
this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider
the quality of it is above my expectations
i would see how this goes and update the review
c level control provide from ve to high ve boost
get it if youre a simple player with few fx in your arsenal
i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal
very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound
i tried the cad m179
but if you like to go deep youll love the fender fuse software
i like to hit things
i am sorry to say that i returned it
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal
much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws
thats where this product comes in
and i really like this one
the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
some days i hate it
i would like to let people know they are very stiff
as ive said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing
couldnt be happier with my purchase
bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops
but not quiet up to par
the beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loop
occasionally i get a small pop when i engage it but not that frequently
which can dramatically shape the overall sound
the whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube
this thing is way smaller than i expected
battery life isnt super but satisfactory
but then id go buy another one
but again for simple storageprotection its a nonissue
again my bloody experience taught me that
this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band
this is a nifty little tuner
this is a good product which ive seen many people use
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
daddarios are top quality and very reasonably priced
you cant go wrong with monster cables
you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this
when you remove the strap any picks in the pocket fall out
check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing
these are slightly shorter than other stands i have
not for real heavy usage anyway
classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black 76 tele custom
as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand
i think this is understandable though
it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow
oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard
buy the focusrite interface or one of the others
the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable
i bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp i play guitar
a lil awkward for some
no neck damage to axes
for such a low price you cant go wrong
buy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed
the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily
i havent figured out which yet
what this produces is smooth oldstyle overdrive
6 this thing is heavy and rugged
it is a different feel if not try half rounds
its a very solid fairly large item made of heavy cast metal
most of all they are cheap
ive purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable
but if youre popping and slapping these come through loud and clear
just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper asian made
it will overheat the amp and start acting weird
it works great thank you nady and amazon
i use this strings with an ibanez rg custom with dimarzios
the tuning is excellent and so easy
give it a test drive and let your ears decide
it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones
especially considering the price these are brilliant
my son practically ran to the ups man when the truck pulled up
ive tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated
you arent even looking at this pedal
i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great
it sounds amazing for the price
the latest one has a very mellow amber color led
smallest cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find
note its vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference
it feels heavy duty and stays still during use
save this as a preset
accurate with tv on in the background
they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse
there are much better ones on the market
behringer gave me a link to download
i own 18 guitars 16 of which are electrics
maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up
a good instrument is worth protecting
it operates on two aa batteries included
its a must for any rambunctious guitar player
i own the holier grail
the c1 is probably the most universal of all the models
honestly the strings are great
i just dont like the features of this stand at all
good display and very easy to use
no more slipping out of tune
quick to set up  tear down  adjust
this stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well
there are tonal differences as expected
it stays in tune and is fun to play
the screen is big and easily read
quality seems top notch design is simple and effective
im sure it can be done using the fuse editor
now i have a lot more guitar for my money
i cant remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff
easy to install strap locks
if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap
if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case
it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords
onebutton operation makes it simple to operate
while being light and portable
lets hope this is just a shortterm fluke
i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars
good service product packing and delivery time
i much prefer it without the winder
ive used electronic tuners for a long time
try it till you ready to by more expensive string
i use this as my 34clean34 sound without the overdrive
very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker
got this stand to mount a studio projects c1 condenser mic
check it out the reviews on youtube
im going to sell this product
great for a beginner electric
it is part of 34my sound34
jcm800 in a 30 dollar box
tried it didnt like it returned it
the gateshop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review
the construction fabric color and padding are all a1
it is not so tight as to fatigue but the response is positive
simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all
this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths
super excellent for dimly lighted rooms
inf file that is important
saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome
i dont know if thats still the case
i recommend this capo without reservation
but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it
i took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared
the bad the driver for this thing is horrible under windows xp
great bag well padded the shoulder strap is nice
i lose them before they wear out
nice inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem
first lets get the easy stuff done with
but fat or skinny daddario makes some of the best strings out there
the bench is very sturdy and comfortable  the cushioning is thick and soft
and for its price its well worth it
in short it works great the sp01 isolates the mic extremely well
this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me
i have an alvarez yari acoustic guitar that i absolutely love
i like the durability of it and the onoff switch
if i had it to do all over i would save my money
the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long
this works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws
i deduct 1 star because the loud feedback
whether thats a good thing
good quality cord and connectors
i know it will come in handy sooner or later
i really did not expect much from this rag
im very happy with this stand
after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy
this little tuner is very precise
i love the 90 degree connection
theres nothing complicated about this purchase
i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly
i think the build on these are fine for daily use
overall impression  the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives
at least the ones i was sent
these people just do not know how to read
it might even be cheaper
that said ill say again the straplok system is a great product
these danelectro pedals are great quality for the money
i have to say it works very well for the price
after that your record will sound brand new again
i love the very soft warm sound they provide
but its sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job
for guitars its not as good as hercules
electric thin neck vs thick etc easily
what they sound like and play like is the most important thing
i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most
correct me if im wrong
i liked it so much i bought a second
60mm pitch black guitar picks best
this model is not usb
i picked up an old boss me6b that required the boss bra120 power supply
it mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need
believe it or not ive yet to use this screen
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me
all the pitch shift settings sound like theyre 30 cents sharp
so when i needed more strings i just got fenders
i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport
vox has never really made great modeling stuff
none of that makes me dislike the pedal
im very pleased with the product and the price
if i dont change anything most of the time it works ok
everywhere you read these are the strings to have
i have used it on mandolins guitars violins and violas and double bass
however i found it can only be attached in one place
this is an excellent product
quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch
its reasonably quiet acoustically but it shines when plugged in
easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches
do not let the size of this little amp fool you
awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop ab
has some nice rubber on the bottom
i know it will perform
they do look particularly good plugged into a marshall half stack
you cannot even get a backpack for this price
i find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold
i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid
its well laid out and easy to get to all the settings
as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material
my hunch is that a good powered 4port hub would be equally effective
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
i also use it to intonate my guitar
i will not buy more
great speakers for portables like an ipod
really awesome item for any type of electric guitar
the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow
you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose
ive had fun with it
they are also very durable for foam screens
recommended if you are doing the beginner thing and testing the waters
this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders
i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it
of course the color coding is a godsend
case  arrived in great condition
its also a noisy pedal
the switch on that one isnt as good as the behringers
for now i would say buy one
its just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind
the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board
the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright
it tends to go distortion to the point of garble
its for my wife who is learning guitar
you should listen to both to know which is right for you
obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer
dunlop makes good quality products
the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws
find the same slide in large and i wrote a complimentary review there
ill update this review if anything happens
the 2nd one works flawlessly
the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom
the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other
point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me
these are a little course for what i wanted
the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk
they sute my needs just right for the takamine acoustic
im a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever
this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks
already planning on purchasing more
best 100 ive spent on gear
solid well built and should last
i use this for my desk mic i use for recording
this stand is very sturdy well made  durable
good unit for the money for sure
but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at soundhole
good quality xlr cable that works 100 fine
just picked up the korg pitchblack from guitar center yesterday
there is a problem with the design
this is one of the top delay pedals the pros use
what can you expect for 20 tho
some things are great values others are cheap
if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it
was upgrading the chrome on an mim
the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched
what more could you want
the guitar came in great shape
like outlets 182113 outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9v and 12v
certainly do not get the rc 2
the mike doesnt have an onoff switch perhaps its  only real deficiency
i may buy another set soon and restring the shortscale instrument with lights
will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day
i would highly recommend this to you guitar players
the snake took its place
oh and tight strap button holes
for the price though its hard to knock on them too much
i wish i had 4 ears so i could buy another one
it really gets around and tunes them all
ill probably be buried with one in my hand
yes there many banjos and some with more frills
it is durable and effective
keeping in mind im a guitar player who just bought a drum kit
the shubb works great on both
these strings are really quite good but i wouldnt call them perfect
great strings an industry standard at a great price whats nor to love
i highly recommend this upgrade
i got the sound i wanted
theyre very inexpensive but seemingly quite high quality
i will not recommend to other musicians
they are still supple and easy to wind up
id order again if i had to
the color is spot on with the pictures shown
looks good on any wall
heck maybe uke players should try those too
multivoltage capability for worldwide use powering eight pedals and very cost effective too
after several days i felt much better about it
so i want to keep a completed pack for back up
boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet
not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day
i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great
this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope
i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable
it is basic and not fancy
the snark sn8 delivered on both counts and more
this is a nononsense cheap guitar stand
the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins
the shoulder strap tends to move while you play
the fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price
played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now
i was using a nylon strap before i got this one
they seem more durable than other brands
also my pitch harmonics better known as squealies come out clearer to me
ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars
these do it for me
but overall i like it
but your tone will still stink
i bought this tuner for my mandolin
i have about quit using picks now
this is a cheaper alternative to the 34string swing34 wall mount considerably less expensive
at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months
when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it
this seems to be a nice rugged stand
as it is its very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii
go sell your snake oil to someone else
how complicated can that really be
a workaround for the main issue follows the review
but aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound
he loved them all and wont quit playing with them
these tuners including the red version are the best
its very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar
keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break
i have had no problem with performance
youll get latency with any type of recording device
these are okay strings for the folk guitar
the case is kick ass too easily a 50 value
i have these on my jazz bass my guitar player has another brand
i absolutely love using these strings 1046 on my telecaster and stratocaster
to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts
the strap button has a radius about 316ths of an inch
of course a guitar cable is a required extra
they are closer to light than medium
i have run into the 90 deg
this is an amazing bargain
however thats me and ymmv as they say on the internet
placing after the distortion pedal sounded better
its wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use
there are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly
i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out
played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better
it folds up very nicely
they do sound good though and will last a long time
so you are getting what they say
the musicians gear stand does everything i needed it to
im normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever
i have several capos  this one really surprised me for the price
i guess this is a decent description
it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls
one day id try all 3 playing along with a cd
however i could have got this product for a lot cheaper
the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck
and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer
hey r ford uses them
ive yet to use that mic again
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
be careful when you hang it though
best sounding vocal mike for the bucks
i am able to see my music
i bought these lightpicks because of the price
because it is cotton this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps
once in place it stays there with no slipping
clean bold and full of smooth overtones that work well
many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion
i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc65
as another guy said 34how could i live without this pedal before
perfect whether youre rocking a featherweight strat or a 16pound 6string bass
i really like the footswitch
its likely theyll keep this style but revise it some
i cant get the bottom guitar support to lock in place
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and its awesome
these tubes just arent for me
the pro line shures also hold their value well
gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist
same with the metal amplug
the only complaint i have is that there is no onoff switch
much to my surprise this cable is pro quality
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place
this one is very adjustable and stays put
but on my acoustics its been daddario j16s since day one and still is
awesome little untreated polishing cloth
you can set it to sustain for days
i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style
so all is not lost there
get the batteries it did not came with any
i would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar
if you dont want anything heavy this is good for you
and the carrying case makes it very portable
i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58
this product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me
id recommend it over more expensive capos any day
this is a good product
it has a durable feel to it
ive never had one of these move from where i left it
the dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive
if there is any latency i cant hear it
it does work well and will power many pedals at one time
they work no issues handy to have on hand
you never know what will happen at a gig
place it gently no need to press it too hard
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals
you adjust this right on the jam using a roller dial
you can use this with any usb audio interface
they snap and go airborn which is dangerous
i tried some martins ej16s which i love on my seagull s6
and you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hours
i have never experienced a string break in 30 years
is the the best pedal ever
several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning
they all need one more joint to adjust the angle
this is what i have been looking for for my accoustic guitar
thats doesnt leave much room for tone tweaking so tweakers beware
this is a pack of guitar strings
it uses a cr2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time
if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know
no audible hum detected when using this mic cord either
now whatever number im on is the reference number for that drum
with the exact same settings the fulltone will actually sound much brighter
it will bring the extra juice you need
the action is fairly high not uncommon with offtheshelf instruments
i was surprised at how comfy it was at the price
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
with the xtra heavy picks i was losing what little treble these strings had
the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand
really this is a keeper
this one is a winner hands down
who would these appeal to
went through two of these before i learned my lesson
it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar
but mostly they are unplayable
the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made
it doesnt stay where you need it
for guitar playing i use it in close proximity on a desktop
i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product
for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case
while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking
sturdy material nice draw string to close it up
a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords
thats either an annoyance or great
when the needle is dead center the string is tuner
over the strings it would slide below the nut which isnt good
now what to do with these other knobs
they are not slippery which helps
its just about deadon with my korg which is extremely accurate
the arm is adjustable and long
well worth the extra investment
it is essentially three parts  the base and two removable arms
this is just a great product
i like the flexibility of this microphone cable
no other choice on the market imho
this stand is worth the extra money over those 15 disasters
way to stiff and small for me though
just wish the batteries lasted longer
for the price these pedals are outstanding
i was able to match exactly an authentic original univibe sound with some adjusting
well i got a recording without sound
for speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model
other wise you are shifting the clean signal
this 25 watt amp will get the job done
i love this little item
eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve
this guitar is probably one of the best i have ever owned
the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze
sturdy enough for repeated use
i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes
based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a nobrainer
i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this
i believe ive rated this instrument before
please just try a set of aquilas and you will hear a major difference
lifetime warranty and you wont be replacing it any time soon
i love how hefty they are
one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass
i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off
what it does  first a quick word about compression
these are the best strings around
its like playing a silk guitar
the quality doesnt suck so dont worry about
many good capos have been made
the connectors are well fitted
it wont do long delays
remember its a guitar tuner not an impact wrench
heres what i noticed  the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range
it is ok but it does not compare to the ergo holder
this is my second fender polish cloth
i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine
feels nice and is very light
mounts well but try to find a stud certainly
so i took one star away because of this problematic issue
i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
ive tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass
the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly
the locks work great and give you an added sense of security
the hde xlr to usb is ubs
if you play rhythm dont bother
guitar string 95 between 9 and 10
when in the studio this is where the pedal shines
i am only using for lightweight applications
this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard
i play often and like to change strings often
your option to change the wah configuration is amazing
i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception 220 microphone
it is pack very well and i use it everyday
i am still searching for the worlds perfect allpurpose pick
i have several mxr pedals
plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag
individual volumes controls make it perfect
whats also amazing is that its still around a 150
the intonation issues are greatly reduced and i am thrilled
i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster
wow for the size this is amazing
i gave these strings a try but i dont care for them that much
leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars
adds thick creamy distortion enhances harmonics and maintains great attack and definition
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product
i still cant get over the fact that it is a 40w amp
glue and a rubber band now holds it together
to use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks
this bottle will probably last me 10 years
the behringer cs400 is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc9 i discuss below
thats what you do at home and its called practice for a reason
i told them mine was 20
would reccommend this for voice or instrument use
but anyways bottom line great unit for 2000 and sounds good very versatile
that is they may sound soft and cheap
my favorite strings for 30 years
they have a long range and great sound fidelity
you wont be disappointed it is worth the price
low cost strap lock that works on most guitars buttons
i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up
the line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier
does what it is built to do
i came across these grovers
i use daddario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle
king of the practical tuner world
the entire material and holding surface is the same material
well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations
also i like having the middle green led for tuning
really impressed with this wah
this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion
but im not certain these last so much longer
and for the fact it was cheaper than most
i like this better than my old snark
arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice
if you buy this definitely havebuy a 9v adapter with a  polarity
the strings seem to hold up well
i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction
a new batterry lasted me almost two years
the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip
despite the blemish episode it fits her perfectly
i just tested if all the plugs work and they do
i use it for guitarvoice solo live internet music shows
its all the same no squeak slick jazzer mellow in tone
probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide
the pics and description dont show just how insanely large this is
gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end
guess ill go back to daddario and ernie ball
straps dont get any better than this
the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb
i put the hybrids on the new les paul
this product works as advertised but you should beware
perfect stand as long as you dont have othersroomateskidspetsetc
id definitely buy it again
looks great in my fender squier
at this point i give it 2 thumbs up
the fenders straps are great
if youre a metalhead stay away
this cable filled the bill perfectly
no one can touch amazons price and service
im surprised by the results
i use mine for practice at home and for lowvolume band rehearsals
so my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing
worth a shot if youre on a budget like me
it works as it should
should of just forked over the money for an ae
but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent
i have 4 on hand
and its a great price buy them
im a firm hosa cable fan
best of all the price
folds compact to fit in your guitars hard case or gig bag
things that i liked 1
the leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary
id not buy another of these for a ukulele
altogether im very satisfied with this tuner
those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat
its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these
this should improve my sustain and tone even more
havent used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected
though my playing still isnt very strong  the capo still is
does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type
i only meant to test it when i unpacked it
propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar
this is a great strap
they were cheap and the build quality is fine
but this isnt advertised as a clean boost pedal
i guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy
i got this for twenty bucks shipped
it sounds great right out of the box
hey it gets the job done and thats all i can ask for
i also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less
you open up the back of the pedal  choose you own setting
i use them for everything from full band to acoustic
even my digitech rp255 has a built in 24bit audio interface
but find myself using this even more often
these are solid strings that never let me down
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode
rotomatics will go on every guitar build i do
the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesnt work very well
doesnt take a lot of space
this tuner is affordable and it works well
i have a taylor ga4e
its a dinosaur but has a great tone
other than that an awesome amp
009s might be intimidated by
not a whole lot to say about it
does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar
yes the housing is made of plastic
i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful
you cant go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick
there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking
its barely audible but its distracting nonetheless
other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing
its a good brand too
they may seem pricey for picks but theyre still not that expensive
i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics
bonfires sitting around the house etc
i figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment
then he grabbed his g7 from the car and let me try it
this stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle
set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect
to me daddario are just as good
all the notesreeds sounded good
the sound quality isnt the greatest but thats to be expected
i was pleased for that
i recommend it a lot
a definite improvement on a classic stompbox
i like its texture and the size
then again they might make all the difference in the world
fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med
true bypass and no hiss
aquila strings will never let you down
anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices
im a seasoned player of almost 10 years
i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great
i really liked this one
this makes me very happy
theyre easy to get on and off
works well withdunlop dual design straplok system blacktoo
it is a nice clip works for my mics
i am a novice guitar player
fat thick smooth and saturated
i have to lug an 88key weighted piano around so dont mind lugging this
this speaker has a very clear full range sound
if you want really good quality buy the boss unit
it arrived today and i decided to give it a quick workout
within six months of its introduction jams and festivals became seas of intelli tuners
it is great for a quick way to get electrified
definitely recommend these over any other string trees
ps  i dont review products that dont stand out as excellent
i suggest these over the other brands  watch what touring bands use
you will always get quality from vic firth
changing strings on a 12 string less often
i am very happy with the purchase
these strings did that just fine
but it isnt a huge difference
no instructions came with the package
i fried a bbe delay the same way
it functions but doesnt sound great
what can you say about the best of the best
i like the feel and the control it provides
good cheap mic cover fits es57 ok could be a bit tighter i suppose
this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal
between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered
what more could you ask for in a strap
this is a xlr cable
im not crazy about the plastic casing but it seems sturdy enough
great clarity and definition even on higher gain settings
i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one
as usual an excellent zoom product
well i just got started playing guitar and needed a tuner
i would put this pedal in that category
its built for the long haul
i think it really adds life to solid state amps
you will not be disappointed
its small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus
not everyone would have those
conclusioni will be ordering more of these
they are a bit too small for my ears i guess
compared to my g7th which costs 3 times more it is a great buy
i would not purchase this product again
they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead
still these are nice picks
lets see what its got to offer for under 100
these will not be used much
until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency
thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric
i dont regret my decision this pedal sounds great
youd be silly not to bite on that right
an old school delay that works very well
the packaging materials said that i should have received a cd in the package
this is especially true for the g string
she thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials
bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied
the problem is its just not responsive enough
it is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike
they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels
every guitar ive ever cared about has had this strap on it
but very happy just wish had sometype of order
i recived this guitar today2813and its perfect
the device works as advertised
personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass
i repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikes
these arent an expensive tuner comparatively speaking and thats good
im very pleased with these
this is the best capo ive ever owned
perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets
this capo is one of the best made ive seen
it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob
i havent tested the soundfeature but ive seen it on videos
i am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip
it is sturdy easy to fold away and easy to setup
reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
because well 0o it is a lp
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these
i have two of these
took no more than 10 minutes to install
if would 100 recommend this pedal to anyone
these are very well made with the heads well secured
makes me feel good inside to look at it
these are the classiest nicest looking picks i own
neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop
im a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldnt have this problem
i opted to purchase the newer model korg tm50pw instrument tuner and metronome
the regular ts9 mode adds some low mids and a little more high mids
i moved the slider up and bang it worked
the tc electronics ditto pedal will not disappoint
i have many planet waves cables
they are also priced very good
cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist
the dp008ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp03 digital portastudio
you really cant beat it for the price
lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp
im hoping they last a while
genius idea that i wish i thought of first
product does what you would think
the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly
you could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra
at home or at a night gig its fine
strings make a big difference in any ukulele
they make a very deep and loud noise
this is a very secure and almost comfortable
then it had some stuck notes
todays modern guitars use medium jumbo frets
wanted a way to plug in my boss me70 to save on batteries
it did take some measuring to get this in place
these sound good on my electrics
besides that ill more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers
little bit modify at the bridge will make great guitar
i would recommend this product to everybody
i you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand
fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed
holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight
the locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat
at less than half that its a steal
its not fancy but it doesnt need to be
seems like reasonably durable construction
fits in your pocket gig bag etc
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
five stars without a doubt
i will stick with the schaller in all 3 colors
this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product
received them in four days
would i use it on stage or in the studio
shouldnt they have a 599 one for 5string bass guitars
this thing has phantom power just in case you didnt read that already
excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii
it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough
having said that for a 40 bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me
it sounds cleaner and brighter
they just dont feel as solid to me
if you are disappointed and want something better expect to pay at least double
i own over a dozen overdrive pedals
this is a very good general purpose strap
of all of them i especially like lopera jade
other reviews had complained about a toolow action
nice for collectable or to use
its cheap and the quality its great cant complain
for the price this is one of the best pop filters
i would love to have a baritone uku of this same design
the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well
i have used them for years and always buy the same model
it got here fast and was trackable
this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack
i use this light for music sheets documents and books
a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact
great feel to them and nice sounding
nice quality and love the cutter
totally unusable as far as im concerned
this is basically the leatherman multi tool for guitarist
so i am convinced that they work now
tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end
i bought a glaesel bridge  this glaesel rubber mute together
i bought it for a very large body 34f34 hole electric guitar
highly recommended and 5 stars
the box is ultra solid
i think a smaller kit would have been better
i will definitely be buying more
i am happy with the purchase
this is thus far a good bargain
i bought these xlr cables for my mobile dj rig and they perform flawlessly
the behringer at108 along with my fender amp gives me plenty of performance capability
this cable arrived today and i am still in shock
bought this amp probably about two years ago
i finally got tired of messing with discs
invest in a daisy chain spot or the like
if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one
only issue they break easily
but for speakers or other static applications theyre just fine
fyi  dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp1101 as part of his live rig
clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there
we messed with the pa and all the electronics
ive gigged with it and it sings well
had one pick inside as a place holder
its very articulate and gives you good marshally 70s80s crunch
so i bought this shoulder pad
save your money and steer clear of this one
1 digital drumset 1 electronic guitar 1 microphone non xlr and a keyboard
ive been playing guitar for 40 years
its comfortable and fits my bass well
id describe the sound as a bit 34metallicish34 definitely a sharper tone
and if it gets banged up so what
it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp
first set one red plated slightly
doesnt get any easier than that
easy to put togetherstable and cheap
theyre great easytoread and easytouse tuners that are surprisingly cheap
if you need an overall great set of strings get these
i order this for my glen burton cutaway
the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static
all good in their own respect
easy to install and hanging and releasing is a nobrainer
they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what ive experienced
it was absolutely worth the small investment for me
its fast and easy just like a tuner should be
the  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by gls audio
holds my guitars just fine
like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it
i dont plan on keeping it long
i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively
go ahead and get this thing
and it did but not at all the guitar contact points
it hasnt given him any problems so far
the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it
the silver one is excellent and its made of aluminum not thermoplastic
on the e and a strings
plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs
it works and it works well
maybe ill see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work
eventually i ended up uninstalling it
dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface
for fun i added one of the tomsnare mics and they sounded equally clear
they are even smoother and easier to play that i remembered them
i do not need anything fancybecause i am a simle person
then theres the biggest problem
they are high quality great durablity and a great price
not much distanceyou have to 34eat34 the micsbut the sound is great
it is exactly as represented
its more easier to pick the string
my thumbs dont have a particularly excessive diameter either
they are inexpensive and pretty
but im now a convinced snark user
you may have to put something behind it or replace it
what more could you possibly ask for
10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower
clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers
that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience
great for any zep fan
10s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup
i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack 802 that i had
the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl
just that there are better choices in my opinion
the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use
with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar
those strings made it hard to play so i tried these daddario mandolin strings
so versatile light weight and well constructed
i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews
the capo itself is really good
id prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it dont
which is how it can run up to 8 pedals
it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive its almost painful
and the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it
a toggle switch lets you choose between classic  modified setting
in my house i dont have to play quietly when rehearsing
it more than lived up to my expectations
before i play i run the cleaner over the strings a few times
im very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat
sounds fantastic and is solidly built
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board
its less than ten bucks
i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings
the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar
so far im very happy with this microphone
this keeps me from adjusting my amp each time i switch guitars
3 of which are actually output latency so this is really impressive
works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish
i love em use them daily and rely on them
i order 2 of these for my electric guitars
i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul
going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound
if high gain is what your after then stay away
you wont have difficulties to plug your pedals
the 1w setting is perfect for my studio and the
ive always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work
at first i wasnt sure what to expect from these daddario balanced tension strings
if you need 34light34 maybe keep looking
one less power supply to hook up
i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker
they shipped quickly and i will order again and again
i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap
they have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity
battery life is also pretty good
dont lose the wing nut though
very rich bass that really comes out
but this was a great package deal for this price
i used this 3 times and it shorted out
they are very nice looking and functional too
this is my first foray into that world
otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
great design easy to read works better than 2 other brand tuners i own
but even its ability to take some distortion is pretty good
after my custom telecaster fell
this mic has convinced me to  purchase the audiotechnica  at4040
for 99 of situations these strap rocks
the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared
7mm and thats just right
over all for the cost you cant go wrong
i think these are great for the price they give you
its easily 12 the thickness of any guitar cable ive used
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
this one is definitely a hit
you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers
you dont even need to hear it
almost hard to read tiny
obviously any small bump into the stand will once again set this off
kind of a gross plastic smell
whatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture
i saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets
from patch cables to guitar cables i simply trust this company
i dont use any of the other features
like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable
this is a very nice tool
i dont think you should drop it very often
but thats not a complete comparison
those are pretty crucial to a drumset
used these while putting together my personal bluesclassic rock frankenstrat
they still tune but i have to hold them against the guitar
the fab overdrive pedal does not work well for me
not worth lowering to 4 stars though
the glass is a much softer more subtle sound than metal
so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early
it has to feel right
i am now 57 so i have a few years of experience
i bought this for my kids aged 6  8 they love it
three key words for this  accurate  small  inbeat
well i want to clear this up once and for all
easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft
and i think they will last longer
to do so youll see a black knob at the base of the pedal
everything i would want in a gig bag
i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great
it is not that large and really organizes my instruments
nothing on the market works as well as this
june 2014 update the mini has become my preferred goto electric
this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b3 type of organ sound
it stays in perfect tune now
its really like magic in a can
i had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up
the star of the joyo lineup however is arguably the jf02 ultimate drive
the lil suckers are all about tuning  stability
this is now a boat anchor
i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under 200 new
with these flats the sound is gone
it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully
the only problem most people find is the material that its made of
my hands sweat a lot so i really need the grip
but mine seems dead on
recently i switched from a blackstar ht5 to a fender mustang iii v2 amp
monster knows it all in quality
it has a wide tone range
used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase
the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone
i am so psyched that i found this microphone its perfect
and for less than 25 bucks its a bargain
then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag
its smooth to use and the sound is superb
not much else to say
works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass
i used alaska picks for years which are very good
well you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar
this is a must have just buy it
this seller is worth supporting
based on physical condition i would recommend this product
i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic
item received looks diferent i say better
the picks go in and come out nicely
oh and did i mention accurate
ill definitely only buy these from now on
my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect
there is also amic holder
i purchased this key on a whim
if you play a string instrument this one is a must
i bought a 12 string one in blk
its a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful
look the product may be good or not
no big deal as it wipes right off
but why not round wounds
i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good
great sensitivity and i love the metronome built in it as well
you simply play faster no matter what level you are
it makes a dynamic mic sound great
i absolutely love these strings
virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application
there is also one available that looks like a guitar
this guitar i would recommend to anyone
firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet
but for everyone else including fortunate children the current mini is a sweet ride
nothing at all fancy about this strap
at2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality
i would buy fromthis company again
for 99 it is a steal
i know is plastic but
but without that i dont think id notice the difference with normal listening
really cant go wrong with the ditto
they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing
get a roadie to do it for you
my finger stays too tight
what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone
the only things i dont like are 21each of the corners has a cap
great value for the price
theres nothing adjustable about the backrest
overall it wasnt a huge issue just a bit annoying
doesnt seem to put undue pressure on the guitar
will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of nonuse
i use mixcraft pro 6 and its working well
all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue
this has also help me in tuning the violin
would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but
i go with the rat
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ xd
but it youre looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities
it doesnt hold very many picks but it really doesnt have to
they seem to work well so far
for those unfamiliar with voxs amplug products these things are amazing
so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat
it works well at all heights
like it can do all this crazy cool stuff
best price online and the shipping was super fast
bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price
i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary
sorry but thats some big company b
although i only play for fun i still play 23 hours a day
they work great for me
coated strings are a simpler alternative
i adore the sound and the reliability
as just simply an amp it has more power  as good of sound
ill stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser
features i like  lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
for desktop users heres what id do
this is a pretty strong cable
a good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control
i still use both brands
my mic200 and mic800 are much better than this
over the years ive tried several different brands of string
im really surprised at how well they perform
non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick
definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it
however the manual shows exact settings for computer use
if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise
ive bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts
i believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds
i neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect
there was one review that mentioned it isnt for female vocalists
i can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red
which is yet another step forward in highquality home recordings
i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought
they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill
i suppose it is the best choise for your kid
i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars
however it doesnt appear to hold anyone with excess weight
i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity
he especially likes the colors
the tone none the less is very usable and sounds great
this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan
they sound much better and arent quite as loud
i like tremolo but its virtually useless in this unit
very good price and good performance
if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet
quite simply this is a really nice guitar
the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches
excellent product though the metronome is of no value but thats not important
i wish theyd just name the settings 34clean34 34overdrive34 34distortion34 and so on
even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable
this does what you expect it stands up a guitar
it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port
all of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience
i bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo
my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one
id owned a phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one
i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not
over the years ive literally owned dozens of electronic tuners
but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box
holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise
they are getting very very close to tube sound
i play while im watching the news
great connection sounds good and no issues at all
has padding where it needs it to protect guitar
but back to the tuners
im crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last
the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders
overall a very useable metronome
i used to use those old stretchy things
i love it and i am using it almost every single day
5 stars to amazons return policy thouh
you can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higherwatt amp
if you own a guitar this is the best product out there
maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage
more tubelike sound than a toprated tube amp
what else can i say
and there are two clicks to choose from
part number  83cb made in usa
this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body
fighting stubborn leather openings especially if new
it is very well made
i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them
but the sound is the problem
overall im really happy with this pedal
might as well go allin
im happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries
the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars
id read some good reviews and 2000 isnt much money
i needed light without the heat
if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley 4 knob
however if you mostly play rhythm id stick with the stock speaker
they stay in tune very nicely
the unit itself is great
however chilling them did work well enough
geart for setups and takedowns
highly recommended for the adventurous uke player
i use neither of these so i have no comment on their usability
i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year
at least these guys listen
even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dustshedding they do
it will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs
you can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually
i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well
this guitar sounds good feels good looks very good
one other thing it works better if you put it in front
these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar
i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed
i looked to make sure it wasnt warped or cracked and it wasnt
the wire could be a little heavier but you cant beat the value
ive tried some usb sound cards without success
i got this to install it on a podium
so i returned it and they lost the sale
the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome
i love this strap try one you wont be dissapointed
a great buy worth the money
there are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string
i love being able to adjust the tension
not sure how they will last time will tell
sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off
double dog dare ya to do better
this pedal is beyond loud
the product works perfectly and is durable
053 as compared to my old martins which went from 0012 to 0054
the satch amplug is a welcome addition to my collection
but come back to these every time
there are two ways guitar strings go bad
i think you will like this board
theyre also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s
they will sound great for the life of the string
i am so extremely happy with them
this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts808 pedal
have used it several times and first battery still has juice
guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now
i use it for external audio recording for dslr video
i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same
of course those guys abuse their equipment
they have a really nice sound to them
the are the same as came on my guitar
this will b my 2nd one of these so to me its worth it
they must have standard fittings on mikes
it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden
a single dot of superglue fixed that
you can not go go with a set or two of elixers
the case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy
that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well
i wanted an upgrade to my tu2 which i had for years
that said youll probably do ok
to me the warranty is worth it because of the price
so many functions and just a great design
good product at a great price
it has a great tone
for lead these sound dull
i eventually put back the original el84s and that didnt help
i got this for my grandsons squier by fender 34 size acoustic
this is the better choice for musicians
its an amazing tool for keyboard player
we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost
i have a martin hd28 with the large grover tuners
got to me in two days
the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened
the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition
i choose this one because it was very durable
this is a good quality microphone
the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder
might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying
i switched to these and havent broke a string since
i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these
this is thicker than the
most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker
this little guitar stand works very well
from the audacity web site
suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these
but these were trashed in a month
this leaves the level controlsa place where mxl could have been more careful
i put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise
cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications
this is my fifth time buying this stuff
ive used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars
i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds
this microphone only has a usb port
i said all that bc i dont want to come off as condescending
i have these on all three of my fenders
the sting cutter works well
i put new strings on after using this and man
had it for about two weeks and im about to return it now
the only suggestion i would make is to have a different soundhole cover
and i feel that way about music
duh i should have thought about this it makes perfect sense in retrospect
the primary effect of compression is to level or normalize the output across frequencies
i ordered a ts 6v6 and am still waiting for it
that should make me about 58
i wish it had a bit more gain
i purchased this item sometime in august and think its pretty good
use it every time i restring my guitar works really good
what would i recommend you purchase
it fit my ibanez acoustic just fine
we got a good deal too
type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome
i bought this for my new 12 string guild acoustic
my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one thats easy
love my assortment of picks and the price was right
dont waste your money on them
you cant beat the price
dont buy these if you have a large thumb
great for old school rock and roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc
very high gainfits in all size soundholes
the instrument overall is fairly easy to play especially in the lower positions
reviews described strap as 34soft34 and 34weathered34 which sounded good to me
the case is now entirely metal vs
my fingers have stopped turning green proof that the product works
for everyone else it should fit pretty comfortably
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar
gets close enough to fake it for a club band
nothing but praise for this item
but the main this is that it worked
i am more than please with what i have received
same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new
but this wouldnt be a very good review without having some cons
i have had and tried about every compressor out there
i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance
i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way
the price is right and the quality seems good too
if im committed to learning ill get a better one later
however when i set the guitar down for a moment i started hearing voices
pros its small and lightweight
and the medium light set is just perfect
come on tascam you can do better than this
what a great price and product
ive done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter
well worth the money spent
it is made of aluminum not abs plastic as another reviewer suggested
good value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount
i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine
facts is facts thats all
decent stand as long as you arent abusing it
using george ls makes it look even better
i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there
the height is easily adjustable and the shelf tilt is easy too
and im an adult so i can be careful
these did the trick fine
it is a good choice for a beginner
make changing strings a whole lot easier
i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion
warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive
this is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal
these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well
the product works very well im able to power 5 of my pedals easily
i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound
it does hit the frets but doesnt seem to do any damage
great quality in it also
these super light flexible nylon picks are great if youre trying to play quietly
good news   these aquila strings are on most new ukuleles
ill just keep using my pockets
ive purchased many of these cables and ill be getting more eventually
the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go
the capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well
value for money it cant be beat
the quality and feel of this tuner is very good
very good and very useful device
small light and stays out of the way  it just works
takamine makes many excellent instruments this included
all in all be patient and all will be well
it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m54 regal conductors music standquite well by itself
i popped my e string overtightening it when i was setting it up
the fender and the deans were very nice
anyway focusrite does which is one reason i trust them a little more
cutter winder and pin puller
i wanted to wait until i knew a little something before i reviewed it
i love the dual bulb design
i got them fast and saved twenty bucks
now you wontactually find any actual 2x4s
so far ive dropped mine once with no damage
attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice nonslip surface
im not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself
new strings have never been easier to install
i always used another companys strings and avoided ernie ball strings
a little background first i guess
flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster
this stand folds into a pretty small package but supports the guitar very solidly
i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster
the heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well
installed on two guitars and i love them
these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too
i am a tone freak
i will update in a few weeks as i see how long they last
if it works theres nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it
i sprayed it in my bass guitars pot and now its like new
now lets talk about how the pedal sounds
but no hum or noise and seems solid
look at what it does and what it costs
its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy
comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly
anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have
at the music store i stumbled on the dunlop gator grip 20
cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine
it is not the size for mini guitar
this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action
its simple portable and sturdy
i stand by that review
they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great
i bought this for my son and he loves it
i have big hands which may be part of it
also there arent really any quality digital options that are significantly cheaper
i can still use this but hardly
this will be my beater mandolin at 25 nothing can beat it
i dont often capo my guitar
i am going with a wider one
primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer
besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss
its too flexible almost like twizzlers no kidding
it is a very good value though
this is not a gigging pedal
they also seem to be quality without bulky
looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars
great for videophoto work or even theater
one of the best stands in the industry
the ds1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal
good solid connections with no play
both by vibration and mic
the case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets
i use it to wind my strings
dont forget  practice practice practice
you cant go wrong with any snark
paired with a chorus effect you can get some really cool tones
housed in a plastic casing
this is not an easy fix but it is doable
for the price this is a good value
i get long life and very good clarity from daddarios
i bought this to go with my shure sm58s
gls makes a great product for musicians on a budget
i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100
the effects are better than id hoped for
the daddario sets are good stuff
so far i really like these
used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr
i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend
i paid 97tax for my gcb95 cry baby and it was worth every penny
these suckers are wonderfully reliable
i got this for 150 dollars when it was on sale
this amp does almost too much for the money
very easy to take offput on
i have always liked the planet waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy
its just a matter of how much you want to or can spend
its clean bright and loud
you will not want to go back to any other set of strings
even a professional would appreciate this capo
i have been using on stage instrument and microphone stands for several years now
i will be buying these again
whereas this does the job
i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed
the unit i received did not work
i highly recommend this tuner
they will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x
like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined
i highly recommend purchasing one
robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble 75
the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual
onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things
i first picked up a transducer for about 3 and experimented
i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews
but when i am winding new strings it often slips off
they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course
so i put these on my 1978 musicman stingray bass
this fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection
id definitely buy more cables of this brand
unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq
overall a good value for the low cost of this unit
so now it comes down to the shubb 1 deluxe and the planet waves
i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets
buy its bigger brother the us366
connect mics ipods mp3 players
i never really got a chance to play them
you get what you pay for
234 wide nylon strap is well made comfortable and should last many years
its pretty fast and accurate for its price
the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot
the strap had a small stain
very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight
easy to use seems to be well made
i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp
i am using it with a seagull entourage mini jumbo
tried other more expensive capos but this one is the winner
ive had this pedal since the mid90s when i started playing in my teens
it works like a champ
i needed some little easy and portable guitar stands for the stage
i use these to play slide
the first did not have a compartment door
they last about twice as long
and the build quality is solid
very nice classical guitar strap
it might even be over 34engineered34 it fits so well
i was surprised at how heavy the base was
if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better
the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce
uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter
a bunch of years ago a variety of cliponmicrophones began to be marketed
i love the product and all the features for the price
this is a good neck rack for gigging
its still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting
i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods
count each chord as 123  456
it has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well
the metronome is pretty loud for the small size
im pretty happy with this cloth
ive played guitar for 5 years
great little amp just not for me
i ended up switching to a vintagetube overdrive by behringer
snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great
the picture wont show it but they are about the size of a dime
i like the choruslike mod button
i much prefer a brighter more chimey sound
what you see is what you get
its durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
normal pickguard screws nothing special here
it does everything its supposed to do
ive been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks
cant really compare to the others but for me worth the price
only problem is the strings
stop looking and buy one
the seat is generously padded and is 25 inches thick
this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools
too bad so sad for them
yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard
it is dead ballson accurate quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles
phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap
focusrite should really have made a longer cable
recieved set of two stands with case promptly and in perfect condition
it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs
ive been using these picks for eight months and they last forever
any guitar is better than no guitar
i thought the size of an altoid tin
i have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable
the bass is tight and articulate which is what you want
nice tone last a decent amount of time and theyre cheap
i have two of them
do it have a decent quality sound
too expensive foronly one effect at a time
the colors and designs are pretty
if youve seen the youtube videos then you know what this can do
but it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all
we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one
i cant see it marring the guitar at all
nice quick release without having to tie anything
i bought a 2nd one
they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter
i used to lose a pick every other day
not a bad product just dont know how long it will last
well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele
for less than 4 you can see if they work well for you
we bought three of these and they are just great
slips down becuase of wieght
this product has turned out to be great with few exceptions
i believe it has accomplished that well
they fit just not well
crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get 34mudded34 out
i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired
secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp
these are solid stands for holding your guitars
the sound is also really good its very resonant and just sounds 34good34
that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances
very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth
i consider that to be excellent customer service
by comparison the boss psa120 adapter puts out 200ma
and its exactly the same
i love this mic as an indoor studio mic
ive tried to like this pedal i really have
these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics
this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver
im still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood
the sd1 is widely owned and very affordable usually around 50
i would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only
well made feels very strong
anything can be knocked over but this really works better than you might believe
oh how life changes with a baby
very happy for this product
now mine closes without pressure on the bridge
continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry
this box is no exception
seems to be better quality than other cheaper products i researched
in the c windowsinf folder there must exist two files wdmausb
i wish i had found this amp sooner
the dorky pad around the handle
i really believe in these strings
seen many different capos but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser
this seemed to be the best choice for me
i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner
holds neck lightly  easy up easy down
my guitar stays in tune when capoed
switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot
it was a good purchase
every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers
but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with
why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio
it holds your condenser mic very solid for a worryfree session
oh and the casing isnt like a wimpy plastic knife plastic
i dont like it hanging in my guitar
for one thing your ears wont ring
i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice thats about half price
i prefer an extra heavy pick because theres no delay from pick deflection
the locking diecast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure
the almost play themselves imo
the sound is clear and warm on my yamaha and my martin
it just does the job and im more than satisfied
it all came off pretty easily
usb powered and plug and play
wish id have gotten something a little nicer though
next time ill go for a vibrant color
010s but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these
ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now
lightweight slightly awkward but provides good back support
you can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks
if you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you
it has a 18 mini earphone jack for private use
it probably stretches 1012 feet if you really need it too
this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair
the result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars
the yamaha keyboards that take batteries dont come with an ac power adapter
my seagull now sound mellow with brightness
i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery
i can practice without lighting up the whole house
if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldnt be a problem
ive had a set before
i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band
they were much louder and cleaner
still its an ok product
the plastic shaft feels like it will break
if youre looking for massive distortion keep looking
but this is my fault i should have read the 1 star review first
i bought this amp to replace a squier sp10 that came with my guitar
but this pedal gives me everything that i want
the 57 version is also like its shure counterpart
so  build quality excellent
firm fit solidly molded ends reputable branded cable
they wear out extremely fast though
the voice knob is hard to describe
pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to
great sound and great deal
i only use this as a tube amp for vocal
it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone
nice added peace of mind
you cant go wrong here
holds my cordoba in position perfectly
this is very affordable too given the high number of effects it will supply
also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly
i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while im playing
after looking at 34reviews34 i like this one the best
easy to install and works like a charm
so they might work and they might not
the best sound i got was on my lp
but i still have a 70 mic that wont work with my computer
it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it
i especially like the dual inputs on front
2 consistently use and replace batteries
as a conclusion im really pleased with the quality of the digitech cm2
i tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much i like them
most have been in the 30 range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko
tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound
i usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session
i am impressed with daddarios electric strings
i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile
however these power slinky strings are great
none of us are record savvy or anything like that
nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesnt work
we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner
i must say in the beginning i was not thrilled with the product
just barely gets the job done
doesnt reduce sound worth a darn
until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them
lol the cord delivers good sound quality
if its short of center the string is flat
especially when it costs three times more
i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below
today same thing and its obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp
holds my les paul and feels secure
it lasts long sounds great and feels very nice
i have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all
after hearing how great it is i decided to buy it
they take great care to pack it well so no worries their either
not sure why its not
i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings
this new fender straplocks make installing them on the strap easy
for 10 you cannot go wrong with this
actually theyre not fender they are schaller but that is really good
all in all quite a listening experience
using speakon cables mono to each speaker to speaker for easy mixing
messed around a bit and it started to work
if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive
this pedal is not new to me
the string does not corroded but i changed mine anyway
i bought this strap because i thought the pattern was awesome
i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand
most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external powerpedals
i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material
another winner from planet waves
i was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didnt
my best guess its playing style
dont forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder
its a classic guitar it shouldnt have had steel strings to begin with
it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar
i am very pleased with it
fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff
the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings
after adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great
it works great and is very easy to use
chorus is on the mellower side
if youre accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it
this is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should
it is the sound that i like though
the item does what its supposed to
the one thats more universal
great deal on great strings
however the ibanez ts9dx does more than your typical tube screamer
nice sound for a nice price
the arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected
if samson included software  itd be a 5 star product for me
since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice
it also just looks cool and very pro
in some cases ive decided something else sounded better
i used this with my planet waves 9v adapter
our thanks to daddario for their assistance in satisfying this customer
some people pick on behreinger because theyre stuff is still cheap
my daughter is learning how to play and the
it is very solid and will last a long time
not noisy at all so fits in with other pedals on your board great
nice and thick the adhesive is very strong
thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded
leave it in the office
these cables are nicely constructed
it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible
when i got the strap i was impressed
ill definitely buy more and highly recommend them
a great buy for the money
even works on a standup bass
you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch
the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever
it filled a hole that was missing
the snark is well worth its small price
nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern
its not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing
i was shocked when i got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was
this gig bag looks really sharp and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying
you turn on the echo pedal
i found this pick very responsive flying through the scales on my les paul
it likely works fine for a guitar though
easily stretched and tuned with no problems
might work well for recording too when you take the output jack
for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile
it has a bit different sound obtained when i use this one
this guitar tuner is simply amazing
colors help keep track of what is going into where
two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both
for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display
you get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness
it does not vary the pitch
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
this is a great little tuner
perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and depiezo the tone
obtained free as part of amazons vine program2
they are lighter than i expected
ill wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
the ability to adjust treb and bass is nice
the product is good surprisingly loud
just buy it you wont regret it
i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents
but once i got it locked in ive never touched the knobs again
i just got done installing these
the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy
it really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar
a great buy as the price was perfect as well
ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job
and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string ive tryed
it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time
update 6614 still the best pick ive ever played
the main problem with this tuner is the usability
if youre looking to recreate the edge sound analog delay is not for you
they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot
but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package
it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already
this guitar support couldnt be simpler
if you want sm58s you need to buy sm58s
i play guitar bass and violin
i like this one a lot
there is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it
he has had other brands but they just dont stand up to elixir
i am quite happy with the build quality
but no harm done still works great
however when it comes to tubebased pedals big is par for the course
if youre looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely
i feel like i should be paying more for these strings
tried the same lick with the ragin cajun and it sounds perfect
buy it and you will see
thats an a in my book
well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that
it is 100 accurate and very easy to use
im used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck
great sound from this bad boy
i have to do this every time i turn on the computer
my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets
the sound is great the wattage is good everything is wonderful
mine arrived in perfect condition
this is just what i have been wanting for a while now
for the multi guitar owners i think this is great
this is stage one of my rebuild
he used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results
i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration
all the soft clipping is there for every nuance
thats what it looks like
it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful
cut the strings like they was made of paper
it should last a lifetime
no further action is necessary
i went a long time convincing myself that i didnt need these
its good for a laugh
i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm
they work great with my pedals
this tuner is easy to use
i wasnt totally blown away either
this pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave
much easier and faster to change strings
the neck is  well made
the mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16000 hz
it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point
i absolutely love these strings
the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring
i like these 942 pure nickel strings
i bought a few for different basses and guitars
for high gain metal however i found that its a bit too hairy
this unit sounds good and is adjustable
i figured id get my moneys worth from them regardless
ive also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better
well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars
i havent had much chance to play it but so far so good
you cant go wrong with a brand name like shure
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use
i have several types of capos this one seems well built
bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube
bought a second set from dougs tubes ruby el84czs select matched jjs
they seem well put together and just feel nice
fender tends to make good products
as far as i can tell they are all the same widththickness
replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl
this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries
heavy if thats what your looking for
they are good for strumming
glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig
it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters
thought it has to be so its out of the way
almost no effect provided by pedal
if you can you should try on holders before you buy
its halpfull in stage because you dont need to test each string individually
did what it was suppose no need to say anymore
i bought this pedal to semiretire an older ibanez ts5 soundtank
i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good
this one is probably closer to a 150 guitar
does not fair well when stored in non cooled area
not perfect but a solid stand
this is a great capo
is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy
i put these on a dual humbucker usa strat
it never sounds 34thumpy34 or unnatural  but always musical
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
fortunately it was a c1
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light
but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle
not when that string is toast in 50 minutes zero doubt there
i cant stop using it
the little limiter lamp is awesome
this one works fine so far
youll be oh so pleasantly surprised
thats because its designed for making solos stand out
but thats expected and not that big of a deal if youre careful
i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends
switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot
that was a nice benefit
this makes the guitar sound huge
this is one of its best features
i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami
i like the sound of this pedal
its regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard
its full of sonic options
they are extremely well manufactured they look great and are sturdy as heck
i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made
easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings
plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately
pretty precise meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone
they tune well and hold a tune well
i works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it
i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price
i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great
no pick noise just strings
i recommend this mount highly
rarely have to re tune with this one
even the bag is nice
and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard
first i dont know how they sell these for the price they do
it is what it is
it does everything i wanted and the price was right
just be aware that 050mm is really light for most players
hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone
a good quality cable at a very good price
i love the selfratcheting feature of the g7th
the hd sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great
i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex
there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand
the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops
i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar
some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit
i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting
the arms are adjustable so the instrument wont rest on the pegs
makes the bass sound pretty bad
for me not so easy to get beyond the basics
works great if used correctly
no pedals needed with this thing
what a racket it is
i didnt need no adaptation to install it on guitar
this device has really help me
okay my pros and cons
i can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder
ive been using one of these kysers for a good while now
wah this is always available and active in the x3 and below
just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
that wasnt necessarily the case but there are other problems
this one is my favorite turn on and go
it can be a little daunting for a newbie
a nice addition to my recording home studio
they last a long time and my fingers dont hurt when i play
wow what a construction its got there
the tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine thats a pleasure to use
these headphones get the job done
this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar
i would definitely recommend this
thankfully it was just these cables
this is a great little tuner and i am glad i bought it
the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic
you get what you pay for in this case
i really am starting to love behringer
i also use it to tune my violin and it works great
application method is also very useful
that is what i wanted
i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it
plenty of compartments for all of your accessories
if you have a guitar and amp you will need this
this is unlike any pedal i have played
thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review
works as designed on my acoustic
and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them
unlike the fender which you have to press and hold
needed patch cables for my pedal board
a lot of students cant read or notice such small type
this needs to be plugged directly into a computer
for me this pedal was a great way to do that
when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah
the old amps we had were way too big
i figured id buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one
oh as stated elsewhere these dont have trussrods
if you have a classical guitar get a classical capo
its those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china
the push down applicators dunlops dabomatic applicator tops are horrible idea
ive added a photo of my board
not here plenty of room for everything now
a fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from
the trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser
the only way to shut off the power is to unplug it
it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot
these sound good on my electrics
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
the input signal is cleanly boosted
the winder the cutter and the pinpull all work well enough
for practice or in your house these are probably the way to go
it just arrived to day and seems wellbuild
a little story to back these locks integrity
the customer service is so easy and immediate its worth the piece of mind
definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that ive come across
it doesnt take much to work
i dont mess with the noise gate so i cant really comment on that
these guitar strings are very nice and i love them
i know this is a great product
i bought these to fill the dunlop 5005 pick holder that i also purchasd
these are my favorite strings
one star just for it getting here on time
love the tone i can obtain too
there is no added hiss hum or distortion
im so glad i was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago
it is well built performs well and sells at a very reasonable price
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you
these strings are great with my acousticshowever lately ive been using electric strings instead
i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless
mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones
analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy
these headphones are almost perfect
they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha
the sound is very big full and nice
locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open
an inexpensive but nice set
i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube
very high quality microphone stand
this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didnt
its been the vintage tube monster every time
hes absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner
the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch
i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh
it is a real standout in value
trust this cymbal once and you wont be disappointed
pulse there rocksmith endorsed lol
it looks very neat and tidy
so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal
and why is the lineout so darn noisy
its a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job
it is light weight just the right size
used the 942s for years but thought i would give these a try
i like another brand more because they feel a little more solid
what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen
works well on mandolins too
disregarding those flaws its still obvious that its not a good case
glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars
price is right for entry level
with the different thicknesses i can choose which works best for me
then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby
wonderful setup and i highly recommend it to to all martin owners
im still in search of the perfect set of strings
tuning is quick and simple
once in sound hole pickup did not work at all
i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the lowe tuner
its easier to strap up because of the quick release tab
all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it
it doesnt require a loud volume to hear the tone
someone else seems to think its made by epiphone
i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering
good value for the price
now a days i read they are rebranded chinese tubes
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable
these are considered boutique tubes but i think theyre popular for a reason
i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome
was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash
with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside
there is a double sleeve and a single sleeve
these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics
no problem very standard one
think i will get another one for the stage monitors
the pick extends out from the rubber shell
i like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out
easy to pack easy on the instrument light weight but sturdy
this one even has a pick holder built in
this is the tuner you want
one of the best purchases ive made for the money
these are very clear and fine tuned
i own 5 different gauges
i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity
each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply
this gls mic cable is working well
but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds
all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning
now thats a fun king wah wah
intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot
this is a cheap extremely low quality strap
a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings
i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market
classical and acoustic steelstring guitars are also a tad problematic too
they sound great on my martin too
and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality
the these strings are fantastic
i look for guitar cables that will last
you wont regret this purchase at all
i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars
5 starts totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal
i dont feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job
some are better than others and this one works perfectly
installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes
makes rotosound strings really sound off
having to look at the beating heart while you play is very difficult
i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it
the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside
the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too
i used a different color cable for each function
press a third time to dub on top of your last layer
in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings
with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while
secondly its fender reliable with a 5 year warranty
midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine
so potentially i could have 40 plus pedals in a chain
i use it with home recording and it is great for my needs
i bought the first about 10 years ago
let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect
i always keep a lot of these on hand
you can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh sounding
solid well padded sturdy latches and everything lines up
i am in afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by
now the x2 is my main amp
wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables
if youre on the fence about this pickup go for it
it looks really good sturdy and well made
its not great for gig use as the screen isnt that readable
i would recommend these to anyone both experienced players and amateurs alike
we tried it a number of ways and nothing worked
these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully
everything is connected using this single length patch
im just glad that i got one of these from amazon
you can eg your amp to compensate for the difference
if your fret board is pretty dry do not remove the oil
only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately
it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal youll need
i got it for my son to toy around with
just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water
the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it
might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses
ps  look at the price
i also own the cut capo for other styles
really glad i tried it out
this is a great effect
however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone
the shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order
and shouldnt recording be fun and not frustrating besides
issues not only continued but worsened
everything else plugs right in
the first one started working about a week after i bought it
the only options are the drywall anchors
i guess thats because they are cheap
seemed too cheap to work
gls audio 25ft mic cable is very high quality
the best way to describe this stand
thats not where elixirs kill the competition though
these assorted picks are really all the same just different colors
they work well but they are not mogami
cannot go wrong with this one
good strong spring and good strong materials
would i buy it again
i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings
5 stars and a nobrainer
i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot
also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring  and inner
only drawback  there is no volume control on the instrument itself
these are 3999 each at a local music store so
so i did thanks hde for wasting my time
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
great laser nice big fat stars red and green worth the money
other than that i like it a lot
the price was the bestanywhereand with free shipping i couldnt be happier
works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar
the very first appearance is impressive
i promise you wont be sorry mcons  no power supply or usb cable
since then ive tried various sizes and brands  dunlop planet waves etc
select your material select your weight and youre done right
for 169 you cant expect to have the top of the line
so i tried this monster cable
yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for
hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation while lowering our labor costs
this amp has tons of power to spare
60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the same
battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it
this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster
there is no better modeling amp for my needs
i played it all but 2 weeks until i got bored and stopped
with this little gadget there is no guess work
the metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program
a quality bag for a quality instrument
i have to say i really couldnt feel the difference
much better than standard industrial strength velcro
so dont buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use
i am using this for my 112 amps
but on a budget this mic is amazing
truly a great piece of gear
crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch
and it will sustain your notes
they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal
its definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this
i find myself using it a lot
perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic
the quality seems to be good and installation went fine
for now ill stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb
it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically
this attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter
on a guitar strings are everything
electrons go through it and dont leak out so its perfect i guess
this was my first guitar
i was able to get great marshall like tone out of it quite easily
not so much for a guy
footswitch jack is on the front
there was some slight noticeable differences
great for the desktop and vocals
it is all i want or need from a stand
piece of plastic with no bracing
however it broke not too long after i bought it
well they werent very close anyway
a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar
im happy with this purchase
works so much better than the string around the neck thing
goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks
there are two on settings  regular on and fx on
im a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it
runs forever on a ninevolt battery
of course this would not result in 20 feet when its stretched
but if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse
and oh my it records good
but i really wanted 34natural wood34 and it isnt
however it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim
they used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves
i like to experiment with different types of picks
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
the unit itself seems sturdy and well made
i got what i ordered
in fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set
bought this for a friend
i have had two for years
this is a great value
i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string
metal case compact nice bracket lighted remote telling you when its ready
i love mine  so do my friends
so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet
stays where it is supposed to
with the sm7b you dont have to
works amazing in fl studio
i really havent used channel two much
i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught
it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too
this is a great little ukulele to have around the house
dont know why i waited so long to get one
its a fantastic little tuner
if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect
the treble strings bend pretty easily
and at the asking price who can resist
i use them as room mics mainly for which they perform admirably
i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet
they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion
i have countless delay pedals and racks
i am in agreement with others that state this is a musthave
so in the end 45 stars
the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd 500 are amazing
the sound is very natural and true to my voice
fold it up to take with me when i go out of town
plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises
nonmarring adhesive on back wont damage guitar finishes
or go buy a k kustum and quit your sniveling
my stand doesnt tip over like the others
these tend to last me about 3 months
i already owned two of these tuners previously  purchased these for friends
if you like the design go for it
also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps
best recorder for the money ive seen
i keep a stack of
i like having the variety though
and the overall look and feel is one of quality
it fit my american vintage 70s strat
be careful with the load you put on your amp though
we have used this with an at2020 at2021
sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
it fits good and came in the color i expected
i dont even have to play the guitar anymore it does it for me
amazing the besti cant believe
it doesnt truly isolate each input
i havent had any problems with them they installed just fine
money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground
these jjs work really great
the list goes on but i think you get the point
the old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and 34alive34
same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it
kinda makes you aware of what you are playing
i also tried two mxls
basically if you get the right setup youll get great tone
leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible
still to me it was money out the window
a needed accessory for any vocal recording period
they last fairly long when taken care of and dont usually break too often
they worked well and were easy to install
thank goodness amazon doesnt sell this gadget for the fortydollar retail price tag
i would buy from this company again and probally will in the future
i have had multiple mistakes and frustrations
installed easily in 3 different guitars so far
fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain
they are expensive but worth it
i wasnt expecting it to be such high quality
technically this at108 is at the low end of the famous behringer line
very happy with these strings
these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele
plugged it into my fender mini tonemaster amp
the effects are beautifully done
i scored a virtually unused preowned unit for 50
we try to stay stocked in these picks
ive owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime
zzounds musicians friend sweetwater music 123 dont buy from them
this one sticks well to the guitar
i sincerely like the concept
works a charm on acoustic guitars havent tried it on the electric guitars yet
i put these strings on every acoustic i own
it ties onto the headstock
but i was happily surprised
it was just a light reverb i get
i own several gig bags and this is my favorite
and that makes me want to play twice as long
the 1 spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz
would i try another pick if the chance was presented
this is a really nice music stand
like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa
i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones
note  we have the burgundy color one
i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here
i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly
just feels right for the job
this filter arrived very quickly
great buy prompt shipping great product
no this tuner is not super tight
so maybe it is a good thing
overall this is an awesome product
but the biggest change ive experienced is with the tone block change
may be for the big one
make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60db of clean gain
ultimately theyre simply the best for the money
i figured id give this a try
i use this short stand for micing my guitar amp cabinet
the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
remember to have wifi in order to connect to panadora
have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar
for that 5 stars easy
imho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording
great deal for the price
for those looking for insane crunch this isnt for you
its not just a uke tuner
only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all its tubes and thinking
theyve been shrinking for over 50 years
im pleasantly surprised with this cable
if you want to get the right effect this is a good choice
some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking
went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand
so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper
simple and useful rack stand
these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick
its the best strap money can buy
i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric
the weight of the stand itself stripped it
can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall
replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue
but very nice balance as i said
the mic has loud voice in my karaoke
this strap was very well designed and thoughtout before going to manufacture
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy
havent had a problem until now
you must use the headphone jack on the interface
they look great theyre easy to install and they work very well
best i could find for this time of hard case
one for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great
i am really loving it
my testing is ongoing and cannot give the elixir a top rating yet
the jp02 frees me up from any other wall warts
some of us arent that luckyor giftedor smart
great price on a highquality polishing cloth
these are very bright and clean
if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out
boy did i hit a home run with that
it also works great for any instrument or sound system
it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes
in my opinion it is worth the money
id still not abuse them too much though
the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient
like the crush or roland cube it has its own voice
lolwould allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice
i was origianlly disappointed in the sound
many people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone
not much to say here  theyre knobs
it is a good cheap addition to my effects board
i like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar
these work just like you want them to
that being said its a great little stand for low dutyhome use
what a great aframe stand especially for the money
scratch free durable machine washable
im not sure what else to say
help my vocal mics last longer so singers dont drool on my mics
first off if you are planning on buying the us322 dont
wawa pedals come and go and get modded and rethunk
a quality tuner for a low price
hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal
if your guitar has polypropylene finish which most do youre going to be fine
buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping
highly recommend this for the guitar player
no noise from this cable
but i guess its close enough considering the price
the tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement
might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad
im glad i replaced it
mainly due to the low cost
i like fender mediums always have but i gotta branch out man
its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility
i put these on a parker
i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector
line 6 offers tons of sounds
really though its quite good
this is not true bypass but neither is the boss
it is a cutaway design without electronics
i pushed the stand and
price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo
it is cheap and very has a good range of tone options
can easily set it up for live situations
this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver
i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal
that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable
ive dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubberylike casing
it worked once when i originally set it then kaput
returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass
with proper care im confident these cables will last a very long time
works great especially for the price
the rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo
please fully check them out
sm58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high
some guitars sound best with phosphor bronze
this cord did not work right at all
for 20 you cant go wrong
the master and gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel
i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem
the power jack however leaves a little to be desired
i would write them but thats their job
supposedly a new tightener design is on the way
nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery
i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade
it doesnt come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like
so for a good price you get a filter that works
ive been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time
that last one was far far better than the first two
i know tone and have had great and not so great gear
the double stick tape that came on it has worked well
we purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the ukulele
the clean tones are nice and warm
got it to my door for 304
they are large and  well  plastic
some of the best aspects of the metal muff include 1
feels good to switch positions solid and quiet
makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier
my first 2 units have a very bright blue ish color led for power
its a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use
i normally use my korg footswitch tuner for my guitar and basses
the contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality
it can do anything and sound any way you want it too
the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabes
the sound quality is amazing
i finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through amazon
iif the strings break i will try this one gs330s as well
its an 8 channel xlr snake
this cup holder does the trick
for stage i like something heavier
what more can you ask for
the action is very good and it will not be any harder to play
this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does
so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over
for me that does not justify it
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture
i am happy with it
its decent sound and decent build quality for a good price
im impressed with what you get for the price
but like many newer players i didnt know any better at the time
these were filler items for a much larger purachse
adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos
i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month
earnie balls guitar strap locks are great
i love these patch cables
easy on and off and stays put
youll need to adopt a philosophy on gain
i ordered two of these stands and they work very well
it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones
you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out
im very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job
i still like my line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain
probably one of the reasons its so affordable
the two experiences are not the same
i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar
i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it
at the time i had never owned a big muff
tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly
i bought it to use with my boss me70
helps keep the products profile down a bit
im never playing another guitar without these locks
the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity
appearance  build  the loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures
able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily
i like the product a lot
one for the electric one for the acoustic etc
cons   very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days
my guitar originally came with daddrio exp and they sounded good
i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones
this guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble
according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well
when i need another set ill buy these
i like the layout of controls as well
after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved
otherwise 5 star all the way
no buzzing on the strings when i put it on
it came with entry level strings
it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors
fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase
their sound is bright just like their xl cousins
i would certainly not tour with it
however it has not proven to be kidproof
use this to record my guitar on garage band
youn name it i have tried it
until i crank the dial over and shred some faces
these are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well
and yet the price is the best part of all
tons of verb if you want it
sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound
my bass is an sx jazz bass
well see how helpful they really are
spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks
at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case
i dont regret this purchase at all
i use one for my electric and another for acoustic
also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove
these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently
over kill or uber cool you decide
the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend
protects my string from dna
good luck with that chore
using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp
i do a single duo and full band
much more fun than a black box
no need for a collection of separate tools anymore
the quality is good the smell was funny when first opened
theyve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house
id assume it was made out of castiron or something instead of aluminum
move the switch down to the low midscoop mode
it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff
ultimately you and your gear will have the last say
but i do feel confident in what i report here
but this tool is very well designed
i put it on when necessary on gig breaks
holds your trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends
a guitar player can never have enough of these things around
i will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal board
be patient and get this one
i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries
and all for 7 bucks w prime shipping
he really likes them a lot
these cables are the only cable i will ever use from now on
it gets the job done but it has a few flaws
i have always used daddario strings
it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range
arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised
my fret board looks so good to
i checked in my case
good deal and i will purchase again
the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects
with the jam i have this
i just cant believe how loud this little baby is
keep on hand to help understand theory
i needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic
it is definitely worth it
it has less granularity in the display for example
however i have a few gripes with the 2i2
one gets in the way of the other
the only downside is that its a bit rough on any loose skin
10 but the led doesn8217t lie and it confirmed
i just might buy another 3pack
absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and smallevent purposes
all relevant areas of the capo are well padded
there is some noise but i dont attribute that just to the power supply
for example im playing with the harmonica now
color is good and as pictured and it doesnt seem to scratch easily
i may have simply gotten a defective one
not much more can be said about these awesome strings
arrived quick and before scheduled
just got this today and im experiencing serious install issues
this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage
cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff
i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware
this kit does the trick and truly was easy to use
not too big or not too small
but these do work really well
they sound great and play easy
he was right  great product
this keyboard is pretty dope
just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out
this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after
as such i found them to be a reasonable value
this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion
ive tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to
bought a few while back and just bought a few more
not remos fault but it is something to pay attention to
my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing
they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely
this is my 6th kyser capo
i used this with my samson mixer
quality good especially given fairly low price
it holds well when bumped or moved
measured how loud this thing is
id say it started to cut into spyder jam sales
the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a lightmedium
a little careful sandingpolishing and the guitar was ready to play
oh man do they sound nice
if you are looking for a les paul guitar this is not one
for general use in doors its decent and for sure worth the price
it is very stable and solidly constructed
the string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly
this works great for micing guitar amps
the dials and everything was easy to understand
but darn it this is one amazingly nice pedal when i consider price
my band had no pa or mics or anything
the thing is built like a piece of s
this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool
these are great picks and yes they are slippery
saw these and tried again
i liked it from the very first tuning
it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic
hopefully a better make will put out something more roadworthy
typical british growl at higher gain settings
when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them
dropped one a few times and its still working
basically this case is very sharp looking  made with good quality materials
my setup is a very simple one
they have a good amount of bass
i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy
this immediately lets them know to just speak into the microphone
would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument
light weight allows you to remove quickly
they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables
this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track
they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive
i was really surprised by this
the interior was nothing special either
it totally deserves 5 stars
you get what you pay for
havent played the toy harps yet first things first
this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value
boss is the company that dominates my effects board
the thin soft gold 510 microns
i have two sets of these for my straps
i wont rant about a string winder
the keys are 85 of standard width which is large enough for fumblefree playing
i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back
xlr to xlr from mackie mixer to pylepro 1400 watt amp
it fit perfect on my new hercules mic stand and was ready to go
combined with the absolutely deplorable build quality of the clip itself
theyre cheap and they work fine
this is subtle yet effective
it has impressed me quite a bit since then
these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion
they work great on my acoustic and electric guitars
the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed
these 10 are not the ones he likes
im extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound
it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows7 computer
bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction
and i am so glad i did
i ordered this strap to use with both my concert  tenor ukes
it comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars
i was very suprised that it was this effective
it does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price
the em600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps
not one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night
for my homestudio purpose i like the warmer sound of the pm05 more
id suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand
the us322 comes with a printed quick start guide
overall i like it and i would recommend it
update ive lowered my 4 star rating down to 3
mxr built like a tank
my only minor gripe is that it is springloaded to open
this is a really good patch cable
hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines
this device has delivered everything i wanted and more
physically it is built strong too
one size doesnt always fit all
i like dunlop products but
the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent
it fits my jasmine well
i am new at trying to learn
im an true analog guy
my son plays electric and acoustic guitar
i was definitely not disappointed
it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself
same goes for the boss ds1
it is not a horrible mic
i didnt need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed
they are tough well made and simply work and sound great
i cant really tell the difference between the sn1 and the sn2
behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why
since then ive been through a multitude of guitars and strings
i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior
the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about 45 on amazon
i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain
other than that its perfect
i bought this because the tuner in the rp1000 is pretty sloppy
something i will have to get used to
what to do with it
bought roughly 5 of these
very good for the price
well i hated each other one i tried
i purchased it for that reason
you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings
i havent tried many different strings
its a stand it does what its supposed too
i will keep this short
my 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks
i wouldnt put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed
fits great easy onoff easy adjustments
this is an awesome pedal
the shipping was incredibly fast too as always with amazon
it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine
not really that good for  music
nothing but the best going on this guitar including this plate
the top gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well
put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string
theres no substitute for the right part
this does not turn off when i do that
made my tone thin and tinny
folds up easy so i can tuck it away
a thumbs up for this one
i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag
have others i trust more
i lost like 3 already but hey theres more
after the guitar gets hydrated
highly recommend for budget tuner
as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning
i use this cable for small home recording projects
they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing
lush is the right word
and hes pretty picky about his guitar strings
well its size as i measured it is actually 12 inches by 1458 inches
great for everything from slapback to long delay with heapbig repeats available
it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it
this is a future classic
just had to unfold it
great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
also it costs less money
i got way more than i bargained for
however if youre just doing it as a hobbyside job
the honeytone is aptly named
and it has worked flawlessly
awesome feel sound and price
installed these on my schecter c1 hellraiser
i will update if that matters in the long run
i have 3 of the danelectro effects pedals
nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug
a second problem with the mxr custom comp is noise
when you place it on a surface top of your amp floor your knee
measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or so
very easy to install on the wall
i really like the design
it also wont stand evenly on end if thats important to you
free shipping via amazon prime
with live play this could hold its own and in the sweet spot
i bought these as spares and they look really cool too
it will probably last 2 life times
they had some great 34spank34 and sounded great
i replaced a 35 year old fender chorus with this
its well worth the money
this is without a doubt the best guitar tuner i have ever used
ive never owned something like this before so that was annoying
im extremely happy with the build quality and performance
i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrivedistortion
these look like rollers but are not rollers
the picture does not do it justice
they are made of plastic after all
i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future
the screen is super faint
those are the best ones anyway
i would buy this amp again if mine was stolen
my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case
case in point  pure nickel strings
this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly
i liked them better than these
play some old kiss or some rob zombie
other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily
outlet 6 is a 12v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power
it makes placement a snap
i mean really work well too
i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one
good strength  holds the strings down well
however at 10 a piece i have to give it 5 stars
you can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq
all tube build in effects and line and speaker out
i will review that later
all that said here is why i decided to write a review
it holds your picks and sticks to your guitar
huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar
it is easy to use with one hand and does the job
the price was also very good
the range of this delay fortunately is quite wide
i dont think you will be dissappointed
the price was right so i got one
t is  axlr to ubs cable
good quality with sealed connectors
pretty darn good in every way
round and flat wound strings
had another brand that stopped working and replaced with this
i was able to record a whole song in no time
having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks
lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies
ive ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags
i also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo
i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
this pedal received the gain and jcm mod
also the 34pick pocket34 is only useful when the strap is around your neck
this is a simple analog chorus
they really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar
these balanced patch cables are great
giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth
so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar
great product and great value
both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same
this is too loud for most apt
i put it on the boom of my mic stand
this is my first tuner and its great already
i have a 5 watt combo amp
update  the more i use this tuner the more i like it
this is a really nice item and i got two of them
the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours
the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp
the loop feature is quite good the delayecho entirely satisfactory
it has both gain and volume output controls and both work
my bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors
one issue you may run into is the nut running loose
right now i have the cr and one original speaker running in my tr
i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe
ive been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago
i have a heavy epiphone eb0 bass and this strap is a lifesaver
this time i got a 3 pack of ej163d light
buy the pedal its great
this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous
i am running a dj karaoke system
i have very similer straps that have lasted 30 years
great for back up singers
i figure it tells wouldbe thieves what theyre getting
cheap easy durable these things are worth the small price
but i prefer the 114 sharps over these
i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results
even if youre starting out you should tell the difference right away
they come in three colors and the colors stand for soft medium hard
its good but doesnt really cut it if you want a great wah sound
this little amp really impressed me
was more than i expected for the price
what i use for wah is the digitech rp250 processor
its nice and does its job
i love having two mic inputs and the cd input
single layer of fabric providing no protection
it is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them
they are very sensitive so i feel that my instrument is in truer tune
20 plus years and still working
it comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plugin cabling
looks awesome with my white jackson
this is a major plus for such a tiny inexpensive amp
digital delays were clear sounding but
so i had to order a clip later
just got this in this week
this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction
but i just cant get myself to do it
they all work and none of them have given any trouble
but i havent bought a guitar cable since this one
lunar lander here we come this pedal will take your playing to the moon
since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice
this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china
the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far
now on to the guitar itself
i will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly
there isnt a huge difference
i havent tried the computer interface yet
i guess thats to be expected for a light pick
got them in 3 days
nice and stable easy to change strings and lock tightly
it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well
the description says the color is gold
or you have to find a case thats ultra thin
i love it when i am the only one using it
nice to have in your gadget bag
these phosphor bronze models have found a home on my epiphone flattop
full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound
these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable
either way its losing another star
bottom line  dont follow leaders
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings
ive had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great
good deal just get it i highly recommend it
i recommend tightening the housing because everyone of mine were loose
i hope there had been a closer picture of the product
they have a smooth unhyped sound
its easy to put on and take off
now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there
for the price i dont think i could have done better
each has a unique sound
the micro adjuster is easy to adjust
the price is right for these and they work just fine
these are by no means touring cases
its a tool oil that stinks
i would definitely recommend this
in addition snarks customer service was very friendly and helpful
i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs
not sure about these picks yet
a lil glue will fix it just havent had time
its a boss pedal  so it is rugged and reliable
no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall
i bought this not knowing what to expect
ive been using d addario strings for 20 years to great satisfaction
but i like it so far
young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price
the package instructions are correct but not very helpful
having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set
these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again
good product good service should be fine for years to come
not a warranty a guarantee
sturdy flexible and well designed
would also be ok with guitars
some players are comfortable with the stock speaker
the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible
like the first one works great
to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior
no wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category
what else is there to say
first time ive spent over 25 bucks for headphones
i would recommend this product
i then tried one on my breedlove custom revival om with poor results
the output is muted while the tuner is engaged
well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed
clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well
thanks for such a dependable product hosa
i cant say if they last longer vine has us review this asap
every other modes are just nothing special really
these were purchased on a whim
i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars
i can fit all of my 34stuff34 into the many pockets as well
well not when itcomes to cables
i dont think youll regret it
certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily
fender start appears to take the system wellonly time will tell
this mighty bright is  great
but they do the job just fine
this pick is so good to play electric guitar
wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night
if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately
ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends
im a stickler for the oem parts so i typically by only fender stuff
however its not for all acoustic guitars
so know that going in
i use compressors quite a lot
for the price you cant beat it
great guitar strings and affordable
these are nice clean tubes that react consistently
i also didnt want a modeler impersonating a tube
it can get loud enough over drums etc
this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone
there are a lot of really expensive distortionod pedals out there
this stand is very stable and easy to put together
i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp
i usually buy the elizir but i thought id give these a try
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
certainly if he did he never patented it or anything
it is part of my regular arsenal
and it stays in tune nicely too
anyway ive been playing guitar for about 15 years
for me this is the best guitar tuner
also the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer
this works perfect with the quick release system i also purchased
the feedback can be to to many other issues
run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer
but at only 7 this strap is still a steal
here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price
sounds great right out of the box and plays well
first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x3live
at this point im not even sure that i will use them
very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable
its very easy to install very straight forward to use it
very sheep relatives with the quantity
the usb cable is just a type b port
ive purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months
its not perfect but neither am i so 5 stars would recommend to anyone
they go in tune and stay in tune
it has several presets to emulate different sounds
a great pedal well made
bbe soul bender  my least favorite vibe
adding the oport deadened the lows
i would recommend this to any guitar player
this is a very good quality nice sounding delay
very happy with this purchase
it doesnt appear to change the sound quality or tone
i paid 110 shipped for mine so look on amazon or ebay for purchase
polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric
i dislike it so much i had to edit my review
ive been making great recordings since
this is a very heavy guage
i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsalpractice type combos
i love my profire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong
you get the best bang for your buck with boss products
the string tension keeps it balanced in the front
i dont forsee having any problems with it
like others though i cant stop playing through this
i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar
in short i havent found a better shockmount for condenser mics
i was very disappointed when i tried this thing
im very happy with it and it works great without any problems
fast accurate and a joy to use
were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line
they recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge
i own dunlop kyser and g7th nashville capos
i have a epiphone les paul special ii with a fender frontman 25r amp
to them i8217d say these are worth checking out
one other thing that i had in mind so ill say it here
i also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big
this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed
will try other brands next time
it is also small and portable
got them in 3 days and love them
some headstocks too may be too thick in order to attach this tuner
this is a close second to the g7th
besides what are they going to do
works just like its supposed to
the case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush
the quality is obviously high
its safe all latches match up well
i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it 5 stars
is it as good as the shure
i wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after i change guitars
i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make
tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay
not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips
i like hard picks and these were the ones i needed
it sounds good natural and spacias
this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun
if there was a way to give 10 stars i would
the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones
hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down
i hate their new packaging
i did my research on this buy
im buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables
behringer used to be known as junk but no more
he paid about 350400 for his kit still cheap by todays standards
the tone preservation is excellent and havent noticed any issues there
how do you get that much noise out of an 834 speaker
i think it will work great for that
blame the moron who knocked over your guitar
update  10132012 update of my 2010 review
i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to redo the board
it is not the best but the sound is superior
it does one job only but it does it so well
now im buying another strap so i will have one on either guitar
at less than 30incl shipping its a steal
i use them for rhythm runs and even lead
the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing
i just recently started up learning guitar
it means they need to be replaced
it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them
i told him i would just get another
horrible horrible drivers that never get fixed
dab fast fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced
these cables are great in microphone or dibox applications
i searched on amazon for a banjo strap and this came up
bought this for my dot
as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average
both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks
for price and quality these are top notch
i like the picks a lot
edit  apparently this thing fluctuates between 2030
if anything this pedal is as good as new
i am very pleased with my frontman 25r
in my experience of course ymmv
item shipped earlier than ive expected
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more
this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable
if you get stuck using batteries plan on 34 hours worth of use
i tried the soft and medium wedgies but both were just too soft
oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar
yes i think you should try these
the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic
ive been using this product for many years
i always play sitting so height is not a consideration for me
works fine with my mixer
switch is a soft switch so there is no click
i would buy these again
it stays in tune and it high quality
summary  just the factsa great pedal and my favorite univibe of all
the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works
the chorus effect is a little weak
schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place
easy to grip and are pretty quite
the joyo allows you to make this change easily
i measured this mike at 103 ounces
great price for excellent sound highly recommend to everyone
i have two and would buy again if i needed another one
this behringer dd400 delay unit has a lot of great features
they rotate in full circles and are super durable
this is a very nice product to use
used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 strats
nice addition for the price
i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players
like all boss products it will probably last longer than me
the big music stores always mark up the prices very high
they arrived well packaged and not loose
i dont rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci
a good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks
its lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes
the spring is very robust
well it fits the rode m1 mic i was using nice and tight
the intelli imt500the tuner that killed the intellitouch
the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes
the capo was easy to pop out of the package
others found it awkward to attach  i did not
kind of like using a gm part on my 68 chevelle
finally found the right one
well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around
he said that you can hear the guitar but barely
they last forever and dont break
maudio was a much better company before avid took them over
these strings did neither for me
all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works
i love their flexibility options for colors and ends build quality and price
easy to use wipe on and wipe off
again they work but theyre not aesthetic nor elegant
this review was for the old models
unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my sennheisers
the 1253mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers
i started to play the violin a few months ago
its great for a desk or a small recording studio
it is perfect to me
will buy this brand again
but roundwounds just didnt feel or sound right on a fretless
pretty disappointed in the color
no issues  no problems only positive things to say about the oil
as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable
but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording soundonsound
these picks were no different from picks without the 34gator grip34 imho
the mini tone master delivers well
it fits easily into all the recording equipment im using
is a nice cablegod quality  as always with the fender brand
so izm thanks hde for wasting my time
i have no complaints about it at all
i like my phat strap just fine
common complaint i have seen   no clean channelpreset
all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonablypriced tool
these are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session
these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying
seems like i made a good choice
i would pay twice that for what this pedal does
i was rather skeptical of this little box amp but it works great
i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers
love them and theyre good quality picks too so i will use them
it has given me no problem
i dont know why people think this isnt sturdy
has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer
still hoping for that harley though
it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios
maybe it will get better looking in the long run
onoff in either direction with full torque
but its a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter
it is also handy portable and easy to take places
awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere
it was made for the military
anyway my pros and conspros1
more knobs are not always better
its very heavy and seems sturdy and well built
if its still built like my case never can tell these days
a quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them
my apologies to those pros out there who didnt need this clarification
i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere
shell find the small stuff in her stocking this christmas
no slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwards
i tried it and the light wouldnt even come on indicating usb
they seriously look brand new
you have to see the guitar face to face to understand what i mean
this does work as described
despite this the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good
microphone is quite good for such price
i like them and glad i purchased them  so far
and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag
filters out the pop sounds
tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs
if i lost my pedal i would order another right away
id buy it again but they should really include a washer
does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop
i like the price because of the special deal from amazon
eq is to enhance your tone not create it
these make me a better player
im glad i bought it
the g7th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose
there are much better sounding metronomes out there
small yet clean and versatile
no damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings
a great sound in audio recording
people say its an ocd clone
they do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient
second is the mixer out
they dont sound as crisp as the daddario strings
you will not be disappointed
i have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well
double bass pedal has a quality build
to be clear  tube amps sound like tube amps
had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars
very happy with these cables
at shows i rely on a tu2 stompbox for tuning
clamp it on the head turn it on and tune
this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there
not much else to say
it is lightweight and feels sturdy
the bm might work better with solid state
since the mic has a built in interface you cant use any other
this is a great product
i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack
i dont trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws
it changed the whole way i play now
imo you cant go wrong with this tuner very pleased
there are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds
you can loop an effects processor thru it
looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered
but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone
average to 3 i guess
its not some cheap plastic
quality and value so you cant go wrong
this is easily adjustable and adds a depth and a nearleslie sound
just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting
he loves to play his bass and sing along
65 deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model
it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard
the string winder is a little awkward
good little stand to hold your guitars
i highly recommend this product
i love the tone of this pick striking strings
nothing else ive tied it to has seemed to work out though
this proved to be a good decision
they have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want
update 2011jul31  the strap is still rather stiff
i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already
these are exactly what the doctored ordered
and with its length its plenty of room from your guitar to amp
never any complaints from me
after a few performances i let go and left the amp at home
i dont care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks
i just got it today and havent spent too much time with it yet
i would definitely buy this again
honestly i would get the hybrid slinkys over these
since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try
having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three
im very happy with the purchase
i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications
but thats exactly what i need to clean and protect my fretboard
i got two of these but wish i had got better ones
ive found a new favorite pick
you can also stack the cm2 with other pedals
its not a deal breaker
the concept is great but the execution of it sucks
good feature for the price
the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place
update about 2 years later  i wont do without these
these are excellent guitar picks
amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good
however theyre definitely still usable after that
the demos on their website show how simple it is to use
a snug fit for the pod hd 500
i did this for two days in a row
i have 5 sets to use up now damn
winder string cutter and end pin remover
very nice guitar picks for the very fair price
the board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles
if you hear hum its not the shielding its your technique
compressionsustain wise this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise
power switch is on the back
i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar
ive owned many effects over 32yrs playing
those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere
i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect
i didnt notice any change in tone
i laugh when ever i hear about the 34holy grail34 4558 ic chip
pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2
your strap is now locked in place
the mic end of the mount works pretty good
this is a good product
i am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also
ive tried kyser capos and theyre good
ive had it for almost 3 years now
so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything
theyve been stepped on and treated pretty rough
this one looked sturdy enough
hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually
does what it is designed to do it holds about 6 picks
volume pedal you need to use an effect bank
this will help you figure things out
a suggestion from my teacher
you cant go wrong with this
great price sturdily built great compressor effect
my only real gripe isnt unique to this model but to all snarks
does this wok great on a budget absolutely
as for leveling it seemed ok
i bought this amp along with a epi les paul 100
im also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast andor recording audiobooks
i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin
my own opinion about this is i love it
i tried ernie ball slinkys just for shiggles
i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time
same deal laughter of the immortals
so at 8 this is definitely a win
thought about buying the expensive g7th capo but im very glad i didnt
but im still giving it 5 stars
my newest amp the marshall jvm410 joe satriani replaced the reverb with noise gates
this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended
speak from experience ive tried a lot and did many research
it is built extremely wellvery solid and sounds incredible
i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
there is one concern you may have
all seemed to function perfectly well
some people may not like that
i put this on my mandolin
even the other players checked it out
i had always had some issues with it but it was liveable
with some acquired technique this tool does a job
i havent noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about with these cables
well everything is being returned except this pedal
it clips on easily and firmly
makes tuning a lot easier and accurate
still in terms of grip they dont hold a candle to the max grips
i ended up using a daddario string of the same gauge in its place
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
other reveiwer complained of the excess space but thats what i wanted
as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings
really nice upgrade for your standard tuners
not perfect but pretty god
electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are important
nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop
dont let that keep you from checking this hot rod out
guitarists have become a bunch of corksniffers
i love its size and portability
also run the us600 after the distortion for optimum performance
90 degree trs is a nice touch
the microphone works without it
they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with
but that is okay for practice and rehearsal
its a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose
maybe there is something i need to do differently
great price great tuner worth the buy
but not enough to keep it
i tossed it aside and bought a fender gigbag
although i play guitar i find the other side of the wheel less helpful
small yet sturdy enough to hold a fullsize guitar
great quality casters for the money
purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative
but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder
they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons
i have used it for several months with no problems
record using a headset or youll get too much feedback
i also appreciate the even tension across the strings
sometime round 1994 my friend kendal built several of these for our band
i purchased this to connect a sennheiser e825 mike with guitar amps
i did not  expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitar
first of all dont expect any new tuner to work as a dropin replacement
ill still recommend this wedgie
very big saturated and warm
i decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls
it respects my arms desire for freedom of movement
i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one
how self adjusting can they be
i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast
put it up on the table when your picks are not in it
color coded ballends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention
just wish it was more like a fender pic finish
i dont get a huge loss of tone but a little bit
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb
kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip
but once open they stand up well
has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesnt prevent dry out
i replaced everything with those
i guess i got a bad one
its made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great
it is a nice smaller version of the 114si road pro
the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case
there are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about
this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak
its 25ft long as promised
there is nothing cheap or toylike about it
the other hardware isnt much better
but then again i probably will try  to use it that way
maybe all the people at tascam have really big heads
i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery
this brings us to the 4th and most expensive zoom the h4n
on my wifes a style mandolin it fits but barely
but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the twoband eq
didnt need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much
this cloth doesnt slide around and thats a good thing
however i hate the plastic housing and how the inputoutput jacks are located
but all in all i will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort
i record at 48k  16bits in
my precious uku will always be protected and look good too
allsteel frame construction feels sturdy
i dont plan on hammering my acoustic anyway
i used it on a first act me501
the part that holds the music isnt as wide as other stands
is a high quality instrument cable but low cost wont break the bank
also theyre on the bottom end of the price range
better than the nady starpower mic i also bought from amazon
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
very happy with this product and the price is incredible
it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing
so all said i still prefer my kyser
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick
it makes the stuff i do in logic easy
they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with
with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound
i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner
i had this misconception that my hands 34just werent designed to play guitar34
same basic materials you cant go wrong with either
i think that you will love it if thats what youre looking for
i didnt have any problems with either of the three supplied cables
i got this from a direct from china vendor
i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault
that sort of irked me
one such as the screws packaged in actual twistnlock anchors
i will report on that
the windings brokeon the dstring at two places where the string fretted
ps i use it for my base though satisfied
however it does not come with a cable
normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater
itll serve its purpose until i can afford a real american strat
im using this in v1 in a 5 watt tube amp
the others 10 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also
in addition to the standard dampit theres a soundhole cover
i cant recommend this product
i mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments
just was not what i was hoping for
first off im a big fan of daddario strings and their planet waves division
this amp ranks up there with the best of them
this is the newer version of the original snarks
i doubt you can beat this for 25
great chromatic tuner at a great price  i love it
in the end they are all the same
its routed hsh under the hood but looks tight
just a simple well made product that does the job
its construction is extremely solid and its heft gives it stability
they are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice
marshalls based on 59 bassman without the delicate touch so theres no wonder
it offer a lot of variations in echo delay types
i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming
it works but ill probably end up getting a better one
i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly
my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this
ok all thats good so why am i disappointed in this unit
and with 12 strings it really put a lot of tension on them
but the tone can be a little harsh so i got these
i would recommend this to anyone
but finally you get over that but seriously its huge
holy guacamole you guys this amp
great buy cant go wrong here
pay the extra money and get this set
it is a mandolin case
for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the 30 price tag
first the size is perfect in my rack configuration
i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar
like this camo capos simplicity and its unique color
my only qualm is that its gator brand and gators remind me florida
just not what i needed in my particular situation
its really cheap product but it works really well
they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and im not noticing any extra noise
i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box
other than that works great i like using it
needed to get mic into computer via the usb port
free shipping only makes it that much better
highly recommended for those playing bluesfunkrock
forgot to mention the nice packaging
these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing
plus the price is great
it has a mastering section with effects
it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars
high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound
a wise choice for the budget conscious
it feels little bit stiffer than regular
i use this when i broadcast from streetjellycom
nice lookingnice sound and quality to these cables
what surprised me was how it improved the sound
i bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection
if you play fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings
heard they were nice strings
i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy
its way better built than other pedals in this price range
he also bought one this morning
but the pedal itself not for me
the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir
just what the guitar doctor ordered
this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut
this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals
easy to screw it on the wall
no seriously are you buying it
from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit
these are good strings for a good price
thank goodness pickup prices are coming down
ill just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesnt have one
the direct sound phones block a bit more noise
i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply
so im out four bucks oh well
battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks
using it couldnt be simpler and it has excellent contrast
a must have five star item
the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music
are you likely to find it in a highend professional studio
be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar
given 5 stars shipped on time and at good price
i ended up sending it back for a full refund
the carbon copy is the best there is
i still tried it with a difference mic
still its wellconstructed and would make a good desktop mic mount
they are basic standard traditional strings
ive used it  at both inside and outside gigs without any problems
dont purchase this without buying a tuner
i dont have to wait for it to snap back it doesnt bend
this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted
this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners
they most replicate a fender med
dont hesitate to get one
perfectly happy with this strap
100 picks for 20 dolares
in closing spend the 40 buck and get this
these are value cables after all
the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems
then it stopped being recognized at all
its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength
works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time
it is unusable until repaired
consider it for your needs
the sn13 is another great snark chromatic tuner with a super tight display
will buy again with other size
i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp
ive heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit
the pedal is very good at this
if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain
use it with your headphones or home speakers
keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine
june 15 2010 update  elixir is a wonderful company
maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one
it is too long and will likely split your neck
i own one of each model
those compliments apply equally to the cs3 compression sustainer
i wanted to experiment with this item
they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful
it requires some finetuning to get it work on different guitars
very light which is nice
it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment
to brigthen the sound a tad
is very sensitive to vibration
the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear
this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best
buy it if you need a wall wart
very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect
my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit
just pop filtering through black pantyhose
just suck it up and buy a shure sm58
i tested this capo on several guitars and with one exception it worked well
i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best
the mic holder has the same issue
ive bought a number of these for use on my pedal board
same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor
despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc
the good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them
id give this levys strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible
i go around to different venues and sing
the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips
aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal
it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time
the modulations and delreverbs are well done also
im back to programming menus again ugh
it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt
its hard to beat this box at any price
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made
it works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth
if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it
the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy
this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones
no need for a fancy pansy 50 metal mesh screen
for the money you cant get one that touches it
small but well lighted screen
i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out
very handy and gets the job done quickly
my other snark is still going strong
they do seem to stay in tune well
i think it is about the actual mass
snap is large and holds well but is easy enough to unsnap when needed
the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other lessuseful effects
i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals
i really cant recommend this highly enough
so load the picks up
it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg550xx
thanks for the prompt and good service
im glad i got this thing
well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals
these really do work great
thanks guys for the great little product
an ipad mini would probably fit
these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work
they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier
i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up
it sounded ok and i like the features on it
i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding
also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use
tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my sg
i listen to music about 3  4 hours a day
the pedal generates  a lot of 34noise34 so i cant use it
this sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which i installed the pickup
i do not use a dramatic effect more or an evh setting for leads
im not unhappy though this stand works quite well
other than the color theres nothing wrong with them
this pedal has three preamp settings  ts9 hot  and turbo
always loved the sound of the bb
one section of this wheel lists all of these different scales
if you havent used these picks get some
overall for the price it is an incredible value
i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem
a great deal for a nominal amount of money
they have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better
its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage
i would order these again
i use it for practice and recording myself
so perhaps i dont know what shade burgandy really is
but then i tried this
this cover does not fit a full size acousticelectric hohner guitar
the guitar is 3ply plastic blackwhiteblack
i would buy it again
i am pleased i have purchased this little yet great product
got this for an sgstyle guitar and it fits with plenty of room
every once in a while ill get a 34dead34 string
it has a great tone balance to my ears
ive use it for years
would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling
this is totally unnecessary for a footswitch
all in all im happy with it
my big muff pi with wicker had hellacious noise i mean unusable
good for table top cajon hole by floor or recording
worth every penny and then some
the good inexpensivecontains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etc
now it is easier to handle when trying to play
the capo is very easy to use as well
these original bullets are great for my strat
every part of these cables are quality
you can stop from overdub but not start the loop
the product description says 6 inches right
i think it ends here
i really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it
have used daddario strings since the late 70s
also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays
but we dont know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain
i have a friend who also experienced the same problem
pedals are not budget friendly
definitely theyre worth a try
luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these
i try others but always come back to them
good feel grip and not too heavy or thick
this helped them all to stay in place even better than before
i dont even have that
i played with light acoustic strings for a long time
for me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same
some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons
planet waves mandolin strap brown
new premium strings do make a difference
but i think he played a little bigger uke than this lmao
also its cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you
maybe you want a 34lofi34 sound
now i can actually get on with the music  another excellent behringer purchase
well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent
it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger
there is better in this price range
bar chords were terrific too
very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best idea
tc just does things right
adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter
please memorize this  chandler guitars pickguard heaven
i was very easy to assembly and looks great
i agree with the others reviews
15 days later it finally arrived
cost less here than at guitar center so badabing
i have bought the red blue and older black models
overall a very good product
amazon seems to have great prices and its nice to have them delivered too
anyway these seem to hold up a little better
what you put into the input comes out the same only louder
that will do metal this may not be for you
these hold up well taking a good bend and beating
yes it will help you string your instrument quicker
the behringer for example was hardwired to its cable
five for tone highmidlow and five for gain
update 4413  added back a star
only slightly better than 05
you can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries
allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone
with practice i think this could improve
if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long
its a fun strum and well worth the 20
none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying
this is the best invention since the wheel as far as im concerned
but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks
this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine
there wasnt a 150 difference
this is a great buy under 10 bucks for a quality cord
sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa
simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just
ive been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels
steel shaft will probably last
the nanowebs went on my 1970s guild d35
it is very annoying doesnt work very well and looks pretty dumb too
i have 3 world tour bags to keep my axes safe
from aint talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the 80s
for the money you can not beat this
happy that i did however
have no problems with this
if you are on a budget get one
it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open
i play it every day
this arrived a week sooner then expected
then i got into guitar building and they all got put away
i would rate the sound 5 stars
if i purchase another strat i will purchase this case again
i cant recommend this pedal enough
great for what i needed
as for the sound of the pedal its very good
ive used gls products before and they are good quality for a fair price
it is a standard length just like the sm58
i am about 59 and a trim 155 lbs
i recently picked up an 812ce first edition 12fret
measuring is best with a cooperative assistant
i have a vox ac30hw2x and i put this jj 12ax7 into v1
i truly recommend this one spot adapter to everyone
i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick
only complaint is the stacking of the six effects onto just two knobs
just buy one now save yourself the trouble
the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes
i figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too
with distortion it sounds great
when the unit first arrived i was concerned because the box had been damaged
this pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans
warning for beginners dont get this
i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar
it does its job pretty good but it does color your tone some what
what looks like a spring actually is a spring
thought i would give them a try
if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts
it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings
i like blues style and classic rock
the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple
sometimes this new one just wont 34hear34 the string being tuned unless its encouraged
but do consider you means of mounting carefully
i looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one
makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy
works seemless and great with a headset
this handy little device will fit perfectly in any outoftheway spot on your instrument
great pedal for the money get it
it works and like it says it reduces the noise
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects
the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case
the only negatives ive found are 1
the dunlop is well made as expected
it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amplike
but otherwise worth the price and a good doodad to have around
i believe it has those
these are good replacements or upgrades
had to buy another one
otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups
i like the sound of the wound third
ive heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why
whether you get brass or glass is your preference
its a brilliant idea haha
sure i can still use a regular pick when thats all thats available
i bought my spyder jam back in 2009 when it was fairly new
looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss
the name is somewhat misleading
five stars all the way
5 stars arrived on time and in good condition
plug in for a miccdm3 player
they seem to get bad marks now and then
overall  im very pleased with this pick
its either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much
the movable head is awesome
this pedal works with the yamaha motif that was my main concern when ordering
although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful
you dont have to be a rocket scientist to use it
fx on turns on a little delay effect
the neck support cup goes through that hole
at 3 for a dozen theyre worth a try
i got these for a partstele i built and im really happy with them
get a few just in case but i am still on my first
over the clean channel of the fender it sounds very full and smooth
i play mostly blues and classic rock
if you play mostly standing this is the guitar for you
i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere
thought id give it a try
its simple built well and and fun to use
we bought this rack tray for our sons new sound rack
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time but thats not really a problem
maybe its my naivete in hoping for a perfect instrument
surprised there are so few reviews
of the lot the shure sm7b is my favorite of the ones still available
it will mess up the finish
good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length
i think its a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly
it was a great choice
happy with it  like it
i am a converted guitar player and i like playing with a pick
doesnt hold as many pick as i expected
this also happened to two of my friends snarks
im pretty much old school and like to find my own sound
it is highly informative easy to follow and has some good songs in it
weak sounding and break very easily
small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case
for some reason i thought theyd have different thicknesses from a previous review
it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing
this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used
however the snark sn2 just has the edge
looks like a whole new guitar now
i cant raise the volume above 1 in my house
great sound quality and durability
again these should really come standard on all american strats
im very pleased with this purchase
ive been using elixir strings for about ten years now
the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material
like i said the build quality is outstanding
it also selfoscillates  freaks out quite well
i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip
never got this shine in my guitar with any other product
my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capos design
it will never stand in the position like in the photo
i have a lovehate relationship with compressors
perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle colored
the pictures do it no justice
ive used these strings longer than any other strings ive tried about 7 years
i also have the ns micro and thats a better tuner
that is what i notice most from the hds compared to the regular
by the way bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one
its perfect for my samson mic
snare kick and so on
i sat down plugged it in and played a bit
the first thing i did was went through all the presets
it was nice to get these through vine and try them out
red light always stays on and ive never seen the green light
this pedal however is going to get some serious use
these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost
its also the cheapest one i ever bought
researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the shubb
i just held down the setmarker  record button while plugging the usb cable
i was impressed at how much of is isnt plastic
i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy
the controls are intuitive and easy to use
you could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10
you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz
wellconceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks
elixir has excellent quality control too
i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger
it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now
but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all
enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslytotally worth the buy
perfect for recording loud drums
the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand
i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound
i have yet to break one
if you need this get it
i have not found that to be true
makes a fair snare drum mic
this was a low price and high quality solution
these headphones are kind of classics
it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions
it kind of smells like motor oil
my big nose cant confirm that
battery life appears to be adequate
the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality
8020 strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar
not much else to say about strings  p
when i received the strap i realized it doesnt fit a banjo
does it wear over time
currently theyre 1199 on here compared to 499 or less for the regular version
no problems works great and doesnt tangle so it stores easily too
in this case i agree
im very happy with this set
much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned
these are a little brighter than reds and are best for live playing
i like this cable for it has an angled plug
it is really the best pick holder i ever had
its just ridiculous what is in this for 199
the h4n is a work horse
they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick
i just bought a zoom g5 and it works great with that
fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant
in all honesty buy a nicer filter or none at all
i have two ibanez and two essex basses
it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments
you download the firmware and install via the usb port
i couldnt be happier with it
these have been my favorite picks for decades now
i dont think i can say enough good things about the samson sp01 shockmount
i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back
this cord is too flimsy
good padding for comfort i go 190lbs
white thin picks by fender what else can i say
just a solid little mic holder
but hey they work so why change them
looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way
and i have spares for later or to share
its a great little tuner
it is exactly what i was hoping it would be
doesnt cut into your body at any point
for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect
so youll need to decide what songs they work for etc
how do i know that youre wondering
the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others
distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards
either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost
technical support is also almost zero
i like purple and it is purple
its a great and inexpensive looper
wow wow i cant believe it working wonderful
now it sits in my drawer and collects dust
it senses the entire scale
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
its not loaded with gimmicksjust the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed
the repeats are long and do not sound artificial
the best od i have ever owned
bucks for an 8input mixer
so you plug it and its ready to use
for 7995 this is a must buy
this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer
i was going to get a pink furry one
the cable is good and normal
it works perfectly and my recording are rich and full
spend the extra few bucks on these and smile
it can hold quite a bit of weight
this is the 2nd tuner like this that i have purchased
i got this pedal recently
really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile
hard to beat the price
you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam
its not cheap and flimsy though
the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly
its sounding nicer that way
this seemed like the best option for that
thats about as trouble free as ive seen in this type of device
thanks behringer this is a great value
and nice its like really just wow
the range of adjustability is excellent
and ive tried almost every pick there is
cost a lot but well worth it to me
ive used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps
they are clearing the shelves preparing for 11 but it has bugs
so is that like 20 hail marys for that confession
it turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather
balanced signal is so much better
its a good cloth for polishing no more to say about it
let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that ive tried
and its not that im cheap either
i dont know what i was expecting
there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz
that is the reason i did not give this product a 5 star
it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it
these fit the american sized pots perfectly
no reason to be out of tune with these tuners
thats what the fender is for
it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules
3 find a converter from barrel jack to 35mm jack
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac33 acoustic amp
my takamine acousticelectric fits perfectly and is very stable on the stand
now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it
i come back to purchase another
i used this along with a dunlop dc adapter and it all fits nicely
that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm57
without the excessive hum and almostunusable tone control this would get 4 stars
so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest
nothing fancy they just work
i also like the fact that theres no logo on the outside
the m5 is serving that purpose
i could find nothing better on the market for the price and features
i dont believe i would buy again until a sealed container is provided
this is just your typical nylon strap a bit stiff but durable
it looks high quality and has the white ends
when the president gives a speech the sm57 is there
it is very sturdy and holds big music books very well
it does not break and is very sturdy
actually it was really easy to install
i have a yamaha f335bl and a hohner hc06
the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over
easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in
i wish i had went in a different direction
unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it
i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick
i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal
i do not record music with it but i havent tried yet
this is still my favorite pick for strumming
the price was great and the wattage was nice
long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable
i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason
just clip it on and swivel the head to face you
tung sol knows how to do it
this is as simple and as reliable as it gets
medium is my personal choice  they did not disappoint me
hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last
its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for
it can hold the weight of any of my guitars
dont forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them
a few months later the high e string unwound from the ball end
hell of a bargain at less than five bucks
you know it is a pretty decent stompbox
it coils nicely and has good connectors
it is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way
they are easy on the fingers and i prefer the silverwound basses
as for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree
the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it
it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins
each of the models are distinct
i got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool
actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar
recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig
nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock
i like the super slinks as well
i will try to add pictures when i get a chance
does what its supposed to do
guess that notch in the peg winder is it
this is an excellent gig bag
its a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works
got it for 500 bucks and wish id bought about 5 more
it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around
favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt thats flexible
i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house
i have used a different brand up until this purchase
compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well
ive tried a couple different heads and they all sound great
this cable works perfect for its purpose
i got it for my les paul epiphone uke
i installed these pins in my silvertone sd10
otherwise dont have an adjustable tilt option
i have an electroharmonix pedal thats bigger than this amp
i went back to my planet waves cable
only thing i found was that  the pin rockrd a bit
i know ive owned another set for more than twenty years
as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though
its comfortable and you can wear it for hours
it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out
i bought an ibanez concert size uke
im enjoying using this pricedright set of strings
replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and im glad i did
ill update this review when i find out just how long they do last
i bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles i own
the 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone
and this has been great to have an endless supply
this set of daddario chromes is remarkable
they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics
cranked out a nice distortion for my fender guitar
these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with
solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag
let your guitar be the judge
second time buying the 6 pack  great deal for the price
this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio
every guitarist should have this
however it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar
another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists
should make a couple of different sizes
lighter than a full boom
first time for a  soft wedgie
not many frills to this bag
windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately
great little pedal economical and worked flawlessly
but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good
it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish
unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat
the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke
this would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument
i believe the lead amplug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature
i tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail
one the back side of the strap is not black
okay i keep getting off topic here
some may like the martins but few wont love the aquilas
luv the zip pocket in the front  perfect for strap snark capo whatever
i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great
fair priced and i love the color of the green ones
the click effects wear out sooner
these are allparts parts quick usps shipping
youve got to get this pedal
my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug
the tails tend to have a little unnatural decay or something
i think this patch looks cool on the bass
well made xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini
strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded
nothing gets 5 stars  there are no generals present
and every student ive ever had has one on their guitar as well
probably not needed on this pedal
i may tease and say its and award or art piece
nice and warm and lush
as an overdrive its great kind of a midsy marshally sound
wonderful price and great product
the sound is richer and clarity makes unique
having color coded cables are also good too
a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design
the long haul will be the test
the lows sound present and clear
if your looking for crap that doesnt work
definitely not a flimsy stand
its only a guitar hanger
these will save you a few minutes
the price cant be beat and will give your guitar that 70s look
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck
very happy with this item
this does it perfectly well
in fact that may be saying too much
its cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard
but the quality of these cables can vary greatly
if youre a bass player and use a pick you need one of these
it is an ok strap
update   played for a couple hours
the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down
be careful out there people
the only down side is that it doesnt come with an ac power adapter
and the truss rod adjustment is perfect
so its get better as you use it
good buy for the price
if its 30 wait a few days and see if it goes down
my american special strat came with 3 springs and now has the five
i rate them excellent in that category
you get the bright booming sound
i just cant get enough sustain out of the high efor my taste
very very good tune result
its a good product works well and does what its meant to do
subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with
the choice is yours there
its onoff switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which i never use
i was lucky enough to get my hands on one early
meanwhile im going to buy another sturdier gig bag
i can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper
that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere
smooth reliable action and no noise too
i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge
the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard
i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music
2 installed driver on my old g4 mac running 105
some say dawdareeo deahdareeo dadareeoh or deeahdareeoothers shorten it to dadds or even daddyos
this is a very high quality strap
you wont get a slightly fizzy ultragain think slipknot sound out of this pedal
i dont think it picks up those long wavelengths so well
i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky
this is the pick i learned to play with
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
i can afford to pay twice as much
if you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases
if needed in the future i have these extra plugs
all this pedal does is perform volume swells
and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on
these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag
very well made  strong
that being said i dont play heavy at all
there is a rich toney presence to these springs
great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered
these tuners just seem ok to me
the fact that it is passive really kills it
it has a good range of overdrive levels
but this strap works okay with it
thats because by themselves the athm50 dont have a flat frequency response
i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance
plugged into my 65 twin reverb not a reissue but the real thing wow
the trem function works great
time was when that was all there was
nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb
durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes
my old cable was stiff and unruly
the korg cm100l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product
i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true
itll do for setup work and the price is right
the stiffness is just due to preference
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a 341 spot34 brand plug
i cant comment on the looper as i never used it
if your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 469
this was a cheap capo but it does its job well
either one is not good
it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable
great for picking kind of harsh for strumming  quality seems topnotch
i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
it makes my recording convenient
in fact i use behringer xm8500 mics  3 pack for 60
i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices
amazon support referred me to the manufacturer
the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied
i avoid this brand of cables
and i love using the word snark
think it sounds like a trash can lid
this microphone stand it a fairly good buy
my friends say duh oh well behringer is built cheap and is junk
in this case it is a winner
have these on my tele very interesting to play around with
this cable works fine im going to buy a pair in january 2013
and i no longer had to worry about the pick slipping
if you dont your guitar will hang a bit cockeyed
other people will love them though
simply outstanding simply the best
its considerably heaver than than i thought
these strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat
locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar
i was really looking forward to receiving this amp
it measures 4 1634 in diameter so check your guitar closely
so far i havent had any issues at all
watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok
dont have adhesive to bind on the surface
the best eb slinkys ive ever used
if sound quality is your primary concern well
fender makes good cheap ones
back light on knobs shows clipping on volume green and red and connected green
now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic
i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice
i have no clue im an amateur
follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension
the amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 watts
it does what it is suppose to do
any skilled guitarist knows  to use  extream  caution when tuning
other then that i like it and purcheased a second one
a great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric
the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point
i would recommend this to anyone
it just isnt a high end product5star perfect
the price was right too
these are manufactured on the cheap
it is simple to use though and it makes a lot of noise
im very happy with this pedal
super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered
these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar
you really should try it yourself to understand
youll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions
its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it
im not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp
you will not be disappointed
this case however fits my dot custom like a glove
but for the price its not too bad
they work very well for my needs
the stand works as advertised
i bought this as a second tuner for gigs
i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this
padded to protect guitar neck
as far as tuning goes i am very pleased
best mike for the price and purpose
these are well worth the money
i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures
although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs
they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus
this the second set of strap locks that ive owned
it has much better tone than i expected and very good action
the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it
i kind of wish id have bought that combo kit
i bought this eq pedal to use with a 70s amp project
fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice
one is an inline tuner one built into my amp
it has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele
it is only one hole and very small
you click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop
if you want to sound like 5 dimebag darrels then dont buy this pedal
i have them on my luna 12 string and the sound is rich
a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also
this is great for adding pedals
they set the baseline for every guitar ive ever owned
not sure if it did improve my sound or not
everything is solid as a rock
i havent fooled with the other features metronome
this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received
this one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features
however the tone is different
buy this if you want a started that isnt bobo or a toy
which if you dont have you need it
easy to get that last bit of fine tuning
my les paul is heavy
this with my behringer xm8500 is perfect
id say its a little expensive
solid yes adjusts to right height  yesit is perfect
this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar
so far it is working great
got a cleanerpolishwax type ointment for every part of your guitar
i have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now
i bought these strings to try on my guitars
it is thick and flexible at the same time
a drop of wood glue fixed it
this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs
money very well spent and highly recommended
this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like
i didnt know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps
once you get used to the small size there is no going back
nothing but praise goes to the supplier  kdm distributors
you will hear the difference and they dont wear out like plastic
gave them a good stretch and theyre holding pitch well
im switching to the planet triaction
i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables
based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences
how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me
i originally purchased these strings because of the 1152 gauges
if oxidationwear is an issue switchcraft makes goldplated jacks
i does just what it should and for the price its pretty good
the photo shows no onoff switch however this does not catch any attention
nope doesnt fit a squire affinity just fyi
not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes
fantastic deal for this cable
the preamplifier has one 12ax7
the small footprint is nice for those with limited space
the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play
great pick i recommend it
this stand does its job quite well
i play in a really loud metal band
this bag is made well enough
hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty
would recommend picking up a new one when you order
ive owned loop stations dm4s jam mans samplers and all that jazz
nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well
its literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps
you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed
i mean seriously how hard can it be
tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want
i ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons
a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire
the mxr phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen
i use this stand for a smaller 50 watt fender amp
exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope
however they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use
all it needed was tuning
does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack
i have used daddarios since my earliest playing days
now if only the price of pickupchics would come down
yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that
they may wind up damaging their guitar
so whats up with the 12 volt adapter spec behringer
but its still fun to use
getting demoted from the front page
i used 220 grit sandpaper
ive bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet
buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts
there is an oring to seal the top portion of the threads
im very pleased with the pedal and couldnt be happier
its a cool pedal especially considering its price but dont be fooled
theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedals
the two things i was looking for
not sure what thats about
im gonna try to heat these so i can stretch them a bit
it is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer disclaimer
these picks are a good change of pace
easy to grip and as durable as most
the user guide is informative
how do you beat it
coulda had a veggie drink
very stable easy to assemble  and a nice price
im sure the huge boss distortion box comes close but for the price
they function well and are inexpensive
a boss eq is solid and all yes but cost alot more
one bottle should last you a very long time
not terrible but somehow chemical
this thing just screams for solos and is very heavy for rhythm
for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders
bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well
if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely
however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know
added november 8 i put the star back
the grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that
there are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out
one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet
liked this capo it worked fine
like it was made from the same company but its not
much better sound perfect fit etc
the fun old rock n roll stuff
wished maybe they came in yellow
i very nearly got a different amp
would i purchase this again
i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording
they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup
i guess i need a little practice
i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive
like other kk pickups it sounds darned good
great attack but holding onto it is the problem
the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible
i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss
if i buy more in the future i will be checking here first
all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar
i bought one for myself as well and i do like it
it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats
very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure
take some time but it was well worth it
i have an epiphone es339 and recently put these strings on it
have not broken one yet
i have used it to hang a 12 heavy string
fx loop only works with an effect bank
heavy construction in layered leather
i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results
its a foam cushion with a neck supporter
its like playing a silk guitar
you wont find a better deal than this on a basic headphone ampmixer
bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design
no way this thing cost lest than 40
i have used both and i am satisfied with both
so not much selection there
i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk5 drum mic packagefor details
a must for pedal boards
they are beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play
ive also heard of very very short battery life
this is an amazing amp
50mm are perfect for me
works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options
i highly recommend for the shred guitarist
awesome little tool and very impressed with it
i mean lets face it
im a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables
this picks are comfortable nice quality
idk what mics use that but is something to note
snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find
i though it would be like the pianos sustainer
works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster
daddarios are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics
im very happy with this purchase
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter
its a good amp im happy with it
it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot
put these on my gl s500 electric
just make it one solid piece
still its the best around
the second issue is actually a very concerning to me
this is what is giving the deeper sound
this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software
after all whos playingand getting paid for it
with stretching they stay in tune fine
battery runs out fast so get an ac adaptor
its such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends
got the mics from dealer fast
they shorted me a gold screw
best purchase i have made
which is not expected at this price point
buy a good sustain pedal
it comes with 2 aaa batteries
to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer
they do get warmer than id like
they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster
and botique quality at paupers price
these are very good longlasting strings
holds up great mic does not slip
i dont just love the products
i always say half of video is audio
i saw this and had to try it
just a good basic cable
there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds
thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine
in this case i still got more than my moneys worth
the idea here is to sound loud without being loud
do you have a hercules guitar stand
i reach for these first
on stage has a well built unit here
plugged in it really shines
i now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars
wow it really did make a huge difference
you can get a tutorial to do anything on youtube
these are nice easy to use capos and the price was great
warranty runs for a year
i was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down
they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine
fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything youll need
a couple years ago i switched to yellows
i would recommend these cables and will buy again
there are gig bags and there are gig bags
then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again
unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally
im looking forward to using the scarlett more to improve my guitar playing
i held out from trying the boss sd1 super overdrive for many years
great harmonica rack for smaller harps
it hardly generates any dust and gives the bow that extra grab
but for the price 199 its a real gem
the built in tap metronome is a cool idea
they felt exactly the same in fact
i currently have a looper overdrive distortion echo and tuner on my unit
they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the
filter works very well and looks professional
good spring action made pretty solid
there are however a few limitations
i hope it goes away with use
this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed
it is adjustable for standing and sitting
this little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate
it just uses vibration of the instrument
these will give any quitar a beautiful voice
but if youre not too picky this will suit you very well
but for around the same price you could get a fender amp
i can do a string changeover in about 15 minutes on a bad day
in the end its definitely worth the 120 i spent on it
shipping was fast and no problems
its the same as the one amazon is selling here
one of them is a capo
you dont need the hype
it is a good piece and a good deal
it doesnt sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it
it will probably last my entire lifetime
assembling is simple and fast
turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts
probably my second favorite after ernie ball
but otherwise i think its great
gibson les paul with bigsby
i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room
theres a multiswitch for hall spring and room
someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment
all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes
needed new strings but everything else was smooth
this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
got these because i wanted some extra capos around
the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged
absolutely no complaints about these cables
however i did encounter one strange thing
always add those rubber gasket strap stops too
it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze
plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch
it stacks well with the ep booster and another compboost in the chain too
i do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic
this tuner looks nice and works great
but as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from martin
because its such a sound platform to begin with pun intended
great price and well made
it is not bad but i dont think i would purchase another one
so now i get brighter colored ones
runs on 2 aa batteries
i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable
its just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph
light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped
the acoustic guitar quick release system is very interesting
thats not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps
i have used ernie ball strings for along time
i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there
make no mistake the athm50s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
the auxillary jack is also a great addition
this is a very nice guitar strap in light gray
for classic rock  this is perfect
ive been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now
how in the world can they sell a very good microphone for 15
its a very solidly made stand
it does what its supposed to
reed plate replacements are about 19
dont hesitate to pick one up for yourself
but for general purpose use and abuse
great quality and i would definitely buy them again
and no i dont work for daddario just a longtime fan
it has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp
if using usb does not need external power supply
heavier than the m1 but it sure doesnt feel like it
i like these even better than the martin custom lights
the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about
leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel
its crazy but that is what i am experiencing
but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too
dropped the action back down and its smooth as silk in an hours time
no assembly instructions were included in the packaging
however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations
best of all warranty for life
i have no complains about it at this time
they sound great and hold their tone for a long time
i play blues jazz and bluesy rock
sounds great on my sg and my acoustic
as of now this is my favorite piece of gear
i just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them
so far it does some good things but it could be much better
as i said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen
i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness
it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well
but a real assorted pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors
the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues
attack refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck
and the price was right
this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it
bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic
this guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money
thanks for good quality products at a fair price
the strings didnt sound betteer or brighter
i used it for several years but it is only a backup now
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
its very soft and padded as well as anti static
it provides at extra layer to reduce the ps fs ts etc
this thing controls your tone so well
with one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have
i dont in anyway blame the seller
this guitar stand does not find hidden treasure
lucky timing all black and fully assembled
just play one acdc riff into the 70s amp and youll recognize the sound
for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
did i mention this thing is freggin huge
still it packs a punch
it fits snugly and is adequately padded
i found instructions through a google search
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
beside having a great range of audio pickup the mic is so versatile
well made like a tank
my son loves them for metal
because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice
i carry a backup pedal
pros extremely easy to use and widely compatible 62 no batteries required
i bought three and am purchasing 3 more
never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp
for me i prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric probably a
so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update
i will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp
the ends are leather sewn onto the strap
coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months
it has little geckolike protrusions that grip the e string
i have two complaints about it though
i have an electro acoustic martin second hand but without a scratch
looks nice and quality seems nice
clean really good of prints and smell very nice
ive been using daddario xl nickel wounds on my pbass for a long time
it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps
i admit it my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick
its also easy to use
good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have
also i have two epiphones
love  love this guitar
these switches really are very handy
but it will cover a good size room also
no issues to speak of
this bracket holds the ns micro tuner of which i have 3
small amazing good quality interface
just one more affordable improvement for the home studio
overall looks a nice piece especially for the cost
i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present
i guess this kit works okay but its hard to use
there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well
some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
so if it isnt attached the the guitar it wont work
what can i say this pedal has never left my pedalboard
boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac3
has anyone else noticed the me70 reviews out there arent too useful
on a dark stage this works great
will be getting another as soon as i get daughters new guitar
i am in the process of returning it
i find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars im currently playing
it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor
tried all sorts of things oh brother
sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron
this is much easier and the guitar sounds great
snark solves all of these problems
a must for all guitarists
excellent strap for the money
i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result
and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price
but it should do the job
i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar
ill decide which to use round or half wound after my experiment
great strap durable and good lookin
and thats a good thing
i just finished putting them up and im completely satisfied with their solid construction
the string cutter is very handy
its run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me
though be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software
it is out there for 230 to 299
if you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbing
it comes with light medium and heavy picks
i use earnie ball strings as my backup strings
ive never had a problem with these patch cables
snark claims that its their best tuner yet
heretofore ive been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism
if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else
pretty basic strap but durable and works for me
its important to you to know the diameter of your guitars soundhole
i may play around with it to see what all it does
padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected
i dont know how a pro would rate this
this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected
you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders
it has no headroom even on the 5w setting
for a regular guitar this would be fine but not bass
the tone becomes duller the output drops
i imagine ill stick with them for this machine from now on
for 30 bucks this mic is great
this stand is built much better
great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house
i am now a fan of takamine
im used to a higher quality from eb products
is just perfect for what is made for
this one matches the acousticelectric i bought perfectly
material is similar to my messenger bags strap
i have a routine with mine
i just losen 6543 string and just put it in and it was over
its explained in the manual but could be clearer
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
works great with my fender super champ x2 amplifier
this is the answer to your all your power supply needs
its a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing
i like the right angle connectors
if you love delay and want variety this is your pedal
i installed this pickup myself
on the female side probably one few out of many lets hope
john mayer and other of my favorite musicians use these strings there great
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recordingproducing
it kinda wobbles up and down
not your average giant clumsy guitar stand but it works
im just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone
the end connectors were well made and strong
so good that i bought another one
this makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier
this is an attractive leather head stock strap
no better and no worse
just try and leave it on always
i wear a large sized glove so assuming that would translate i got these
people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm58
it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case
the hall setting is wonderful
the strings themselves are the normal color for strings
think of it as an affordable boutique amp
but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite
these were purchased for my sons guitar
i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen
my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip
works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables
another excellent gadget from planet waves
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
it does however sound amazing
again you will need a noise gate
most 12ax7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should
out of the box it has a nice weight to it
this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear
i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me
makes a great practice room amp
i will not shy away from epiphone anymore
quality seems ok but time will tell on durability
a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up
they work like a charm
maybe a dollar if they dont just give it to you
i didnt change battery for more than 6 months
now i power all my pedals with one power supply
the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell
this small device has amazing quality
i thought id try something else out and settled on this one
i still cant believe how light it feels
a im very impress with the precition of this tuner
used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices
hopefully this helps some who have posted questions
the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate
nice size action and finish
not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument
and for many its all thats required
also the price is right
god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified
for the price i dont see how you can beat this pedal
overall well worth the price
one of the best  accurate tuners that i have ever used
too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound
it does exactly what its supposed to do
i would call the black ice picks medium sized
i personally wouldnt give a nickel for them
and the price is right too
great product at a excellent price
they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment
for a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill
for the money there isnt a better tuner on the market today
it saves you so much money
they have never let me down
im buying 3 more and it will work only with this
sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications
this may be 10watts but it can fill a big room with its sound
used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin
but since i found a good solution i dont think its worth the effort
this is an interesting limited effect pedal
this pick is great for strumming
march 29 2012  just a quick addendum to my initial review
there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm
and no i dont own stock in the company
wait you can call people with an iphone
ive got a couple of these and for the most part im very satisfied
ive owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards
why i waited so long to get one i cant say
i still play this on almost every day
i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics
and i even predrill it
the ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way
i primarily play live and i am a toneoholic
i have recently been very impressed with some of behringers products
if youre always dropping picks losing picks breaking picks this is perfect to have
be warned about it though
it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with
i hooked this up to the output of my mackie mixing desk
i couldnt put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars
the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze
light strong and very balanced
these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break
this is a great microphone
i highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes
dont write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind
whats also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included
great sound quality meets full expectations
still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone
there are several reviews of this product on you tube
i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day
i purchased this pedal with good expectations
these do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage
narrowing it down to daddario and elixirs
they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas
overall a very good product
this little snark is easy to carry around and works great
feels like its built to last
once configured however its been solid
nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght
pup plate maladjusted and off quite a bit
its too narrow at 17 inches
as a guitar player i recently march 2013 started to play the uke
this product is something every guitar owner needs
fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp
i plug in my even tide timefactor and works great by itself
it has so many functions
this is the first time ive used the dunlop straploks system
ive got a gig tomorrow night so well see how they work then
the treble and bass control make huge sound differences
there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations
she has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome
they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality
my first time using it but like it alot since it works good
and have for 40 years
this was my 1st decent classical guitar
the action is nice and low good especially for a beginner
these straps are very good at a low cost
this cable seems topnotch to me
reasonable price great sound  long lasting
just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds
a cheap guitar doesnt always mean a pos
i will be set to go
everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion
just dont wander too far off
i have a ceramic and this steel slide
very cool design and looks good on my tele
there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles
the packing way below average
thats a good thing for the most part
more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs
this is my guitar pick of choice
i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum
im sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though
the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup
rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7
most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb
i love the neck and the back
its inexpensive and does what its supposed to
and this thing is easy to use squeeze put on neck done
i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection
buy this it does work and it works very well
for a committed neophyte like me the ufo202 was probably sufficient
you should buy those too theyre great
i have it going into my mixer which works fine
so its a give and take issue
nice gold tips and polished finish for great connectivity
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
these strings are what i needed and they perform
i bought this harmonica for our son
kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen
this pedal also sounds great with gain
but positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily
did the job for what i needed
its a great tuner a little pricy but worth it in the long run
1100 i rate this a 98 gear head satisfaction
this is a well built and high quality product
this takes up at least the space of 2 pedals
if its too muddy you can add treble
its the least obtrusive and best capo ever
i use these at work now
i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap
any brand that works well at the right price ill buy it
i live on the 4th floor
and a volume nob that goes from low to high
the second probably flows from the first
feels solid and will probably last for many years to come
they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective
the guitar rested too high for my liking
these strings sound great with great dynamics on them
daddario strings are like the kias of the string world
the product is not meant to be used on maple
power is about 46 hours of continuous recording
back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone
dont quote physics to me
my friend has commented on its bright color  youll never lose that thing
but i like em both
folds up easy fits great
still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit
the audio is always clipped
anyway two thumbs way up for the uca222
if you receive a lemon return it and order another
thats something that should only happen once in your life if at all
the price is right for what you get
the behring us600 is a basic pitch shifter dont expect elaborate effects
cant think of a single negative thing about this product
i use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there
the only downside is the slight lack of bass
they look great and work well
this light is exactly what i needed
wider than a 6 string but not much
its just a practice amp
if you can wait for the delivery its a no brainer
right out of the box everything about the instrument was spoton
for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand
i guess you get what you pay for here
if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case
why not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffs
and you cant dial it out
it does know when your guitar is in tune
they are not too big or too small
came very well packaged and with all the pieces
i have a small recording setup and play guitar and bass with friends
by definition medium is an in between size
for 29 bones you simply cannot beat it
i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry
3 tools in one handy spot
when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry
my acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box
for 30 bucks this thing does the job
this is a fantastic little capo
im glad i tried something else
this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling
having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards
sensitivity is good and im very pleased by this purchase
fits straps locks just fine
my daughter had a great time getting used to it
overally solid pedal as youd expect from boss
they even had velcro reuseable tape to hold them 2 each
they also dont distort out side sound
the fret does not have any issue at all
does it sound exactly like a 57
its fit very good to rack holes
they are simply the best there is for a fair price
as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur
its good enough not expensive
great little product and i would buy them again
heres the deal with this pedal
i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack
i can definitely see this being heavy roadgig worthy
use very little of this
i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds
nothing fancy but simple and to the point
these strings are the best
this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right
no more unpluggingplugging inbetween songs
i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair
just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me
medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me
wish it had more speed variance but its great for the price
you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time
had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened
however range of motion is on the wide side
i am a longtime musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments
for a long time i overlooked my sd1 and used other pedals
the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box
this is a perfect compliment to my current set up
i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great
i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps
could be my system could be the preamp otherwise no complaints
nice unit and works perfectly for vocalsguitar bass guitar and keyboards
even if it doesnt save a whole lot of time its very ergonomic
this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap
i would definatly purchase this again
i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture
outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget
the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons
semiaudiophilea bit bass heavy but overall great headphones
still use it for practice and wont change it
stock strings have a warm tone
like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient
it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really
i have tried several rosins for my violin
these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite  and theyre cheap
not the greatest mic cable but for the price they cant be beat
nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks
but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses
hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and youre set
thats all i want from replacment parts
the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated
and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products
the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display
good quality and very good sound
there are also knobs for volume and tone
as you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine
it has exceeded my expectations
small 34thumbs up34 to amazon
im using this with five pedals and it works great
its a classic strap from fender
i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb
as with all dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional
so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks
enter the fender frontman 212r
not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot
now thinking about an eminence deltalite 12 neodymium speaker in a 1 cu
ive read some complaints about this unit
also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo
its something ive recently been regretting more than ever
these fender qr knobs came in and looked good on my schecter
this capo works just fine
id give this baby six stars if i could
cant really beat it for the price
with high output humbuckers you still get some mild tubelike overdrive at zero gain
work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use
so far im getting quality recording results from this board
would recommend to any level of guitar player
would have been nice to have a few really long ones
other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money
i bought to use for my squire strat
for the price it is a good deal
i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this
but overall the amp looks very well constructed
this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice
i like the multiple display options and calibrations
recommend to someone need replace cable jct
im sure it will be amazing
so you can save money on that
young smaller player or a
the title says it all
i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side
base is heavy and sturdy so your mics wont topple over
this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions
maybe adding something to keep it screwed in
not literally a right angle but a very good angle
from blues to hard rock  metal
i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
so it will force you to clean up your playing a bit
considering i spent 600 for itit rules
when i used that adapter it seemed to work just fine
none that i can really tell
i pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers
i did compairation with somes i have its perfect vocal
they should have included something that doesnt fall apart
not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style
stravinsky violin concerto  anne sophie mutter from mutter modern
i like the g7th nashville capo but the spring tension is inconsistent
using for audio acquisition for film  video purpose
im not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short
its a great beachcampingcabin guitar
for this price its hard to beat
pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release
i didnt need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
this is one of the best mics in this price range
the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive
knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones
this one came up in the specs of doing just that
the notes are slightly difficult to bend but the reeds are still loosening up
it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style
a guitar is an investment and you should protect it
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not
these really are direct replacements for the prs se line
tight on some not on others
its great for beginners or experts alike
after researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever i chose the fulltone ocd
for me the added benefit just isnt worth the effort
i only have one minor complaint
these seem fine to me
but ya get what ya pay for
if you have a padded leather strap i dont recommend these
so that meant my inexpensive tuner wasnt nearly discriminating enough
he said he loved them
it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the evs
ill still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well
for under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain
i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems
this will work for just about everyone
no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind
colors are abit too flashy
better yet use an ac adapter
the design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid
my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets
i think ill be putting one of these on most instruments from now on
it seems to be very durable as well
i personally think this seagull is over rated
they were for a 20 uke
now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it
then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better
not a problem for me but it may be for some
great product would recommend to any guitar player
yes they are made in china now
the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed
the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said
it will increase in value to you at least
this is one lush pedal and its all analog
it never needs to be removed
i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent
wouldnt use anything low quality for that guitar
i just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference
a couple of bucks more than dunlop
i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust
its very good quality like all planet waves products
with phantom mic its well done
and the tone is very clear
i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point
the standard for mild nonoily instrument cleaners
very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment
the other are for me one as a backup
really these things are great
i break high e strings on occasion
not a sufficient defect to return the instrument
for 20 this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation
the textured grip surface is great
i can say that the brands8217 reputation carries over to bass8212these are phenomenal strings
this makes it very convenient but also a bit touchy
it makes my strings last longer
well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio
these strings sound super awesome
but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar
this mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our studios here at
they are very longlasting and sound great
considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds
only negative is i dont know how long it will hold up
i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar
you can get them for less than 3 per pack if you shop around
works great and you cant beat the price
i purchase this hercules gsp38wb ag guitar hanger for my yamaha 700
its easy to set up
i ended up not needing it so
nothing bad to say its a fender strap with the hard rock leather look
i got mine in a trade for practically nothing
others have commented on the cost of this capo
ive played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever
the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic
for the most part yes
well worth the money spent
this product lives up to its calling
i have 4 kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect
i think this monster cable sounds fine
with the xedit you call up a canned sound and start changing it
my how things change when you can see what is really going on
i use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg
great guitar string at a reasonable price
for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable
compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard
previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums
its an easy oninseconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets
the stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport
i have been using monster for years
but lets be clear what a tube overdrive pedal is and isnt
again i am more than satisfied
i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is
does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound
this is the neatest little light i have ever seen
beware that there is a learning curve to looping
the behringer ultracoustic at108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job
the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm
im not a guitar player so this uke is just a toyexperiment for me
excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity
i am learning to play the guitar
if you have a very high end guitar this might not work
you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer
this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters
great strap for the price
it simply does its job and does it very well
and im planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program
this strap is very nice and comfortable
6 stars if they had it that high
i still am an sm7b guy
i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money
ive noticed that the current 34most helpful critical review34 mentions this same problem
spend the extra 2 its well worth it
youd best be served with dot stickers
it hasnt failed him yet
both models cost about the same with the pm05 roughly 20 cheaper
thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web
use 5 of them in my case and they work well
this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding
what can you say about an adapter cord
these are durable and long lasting
dont leave any room for modulation or other special fx
like the title says ive been using these for years
this is my second 4 way switch and it wont be the last
very good sound and quality
you check the tuning and its tuned alright but why isnt it sounding right
i love these strings they never stop amazing me
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
perfect for what i want to do
so i plugged it in and didnt really care for it
you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want
i give them four stars
i cant believe the one they sent was so short
its cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well
if youre even thinking about it just do it
its not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are
my plan worked and this is a good quality strap to do it on
it is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly
the cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument
they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings
theyre dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound
only downside is i think the nashville capo looks better
the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only 20
so this cant go in several outoftheway places i had hoped would work
there are several types of practice amps
most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned
for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb
ive heard some complaintsworries about the flimsiness of the plastic
these daddario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking
its a cheap speaker stand
i couldnt understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldnt work
it works great for that
i really like this tuner
i very much recommend it along with some dunlop straploks
for the money this is a great guitar case
new firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects
considerably less feedback 62 this was actually the primary reason i decided to upgrade
for 10 bucks its a great piece
i cannot explain how cool this chair is
but the reviews were telling a different story
what a great little gizmo
there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case
elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic
not the best but not the worst
works perfect for guitar strings
put up against these i fail to distinguish the difference in sound
i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it
cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components
i tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars
i have a fender jazz bass standard
could i play faster with them
i probably have around twelve of them
sturdy and easyt to setup
go to my website and look for it
it is a fender product so it is well made
the package arrived on time
as for the sound  the pedal sounds great
the stand can be used with or without the upper brace
i can crank em all if i want to and go nuts
combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner
the true test was an actual live performance
i highly recommend this amp
this holder grips the ipad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
the sm57 will pop like mad without one
however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity
i am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes
good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should
not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars
it makes it so much easier
they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures
just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job
so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey
i tend to use cleaning sprays
ive been using this brand of strings for years
dont know why it didnt work just shorted out
the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality
it picks up every smudge smear  print and leaves nothing behind
i believe it is 100 sturdy and reliable
his shipping team do great work
be advised though that it only registers natural notes and sharps
put it to work making music within minutes
the uke is a solid little guy
would buy it again if stolen as they say
if i wanted it on there tho its got a peel off sticky back
arrived very fast inexcellent shape
the focus knob is interesting  it doesnt act exactly like a tone knob
very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime
kind of aggravating but no friggin way would i ever use another string
it works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments
make sure you have a good microphone to use with it
what can you say about a pick
011 gauge daddarios are good strings at a good price
maudio doesnt stand behind their products and ill never purchase anything from them again
the signal processing takes place in the unit not the pedal
ive owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years
and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner
so far this board has performed superbly
i know that is just insane
im using it totally stock and its been great
they are always good quality
it stays in tune and dont let the laminated top scare you its great
check the polarity of the tip  is the tip positive or negative
i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band
i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths
you literally cannot find a better guitar for 150 than the special 2
this guitar pays better than some 3 times is value
it doesnt seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar
thats why its so inexpensive
installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster
also  for my baritone ukulele
i would buy another if i needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument
i would buy it again
overall a reasonable value and im glad i bought it
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup
interestingly enough i dont leave this pedal on all the time
and theyre fender so how can you go wrong
so i used the builtin microphone to tune my guitar
you put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x
exactly as described in the ad
it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner
ive never heard worse strings
ive been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now
too long is better than too short
i would recommend going a little higher price
maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it
but maybe its just my small kidlike hands
they are easy on my fingers and give great tone
you can just plug it into your keyboard and play
nice foot switch for the mustang amp
update  1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong
the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy
edit  im nothing if not fair
again the us100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities
i dont expected nothing better this is just right
the foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals
these make great and affordable mic cables
now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice
upfront the pedal sounds great
i just picked up a pod hd500 and i love it
i put a quarter under the 10th
the idea is good and its cute
i love the flat low profile right angle plugs
that being said the pedal sounds great
these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools
the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect
this stand is sturdy and my guitars 34seat34 like an anchor
i have them for my guitars and for my mics
this is a pretty cool item
great sound over the original strings
it is well worth the money
sound quality  the bx5 sounds neutral and balanced
as long as i played loudly everything worked quite well
3 for under 40 was fantastic
my hats off to joyo
it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase
finally it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch
where the stand shines if micing amps
i use mine for recording and some performance
these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality
the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
a great item at a great price
the good news is you do not need to buy converters for them
we love having it around
some sheetsstand units cost 50
this new led version is built with less quality
i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap
as good as a hard case
fresh strings can do a lot for your sound
just so i could make some sort of comment about it
its simple  easy to use
all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it
im using the guides to replace factory guides on my strat and tele
it is a little heavy but that is something i can get use to
they all need an external windscreen but only the sm7b comes with one
its easy for him to use and adjust
im a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me
is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier
thats what you get with this
its tuning range is 12 note
fit my mim strat perfectly not much else to say
a bit invasive and awkward
with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use
make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing
preamp power works well with condenser studio mikes
i have been using these strings for the last 7 years
and the vox is 4w while the bugera boasts 5w
slim and easy to install though longer than the qk10b
but if you follow the darker side keep looking
i have owned two of these stands
i am so pleased and excited with my guitar
im very happy with this little mixer
it does what it was made to do
feels comfortable to wear also
i have been online shopping banjos quite
i really like these strings
the difference between this one and clamp on style is night and day
heavy duty but soft on the shoulder
i dont see this one wearing down anytime soon
though it has no motorized faders it doesnt make my work uncomfortable at all
i have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar
should last a few months at least
if it had sturdier wall mounts id give it 5 stars
the applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified
im sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar
filters out noise well when using the mic
lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument
really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot
again i reiterate maybe its just me
money well spent on this one for sure
i play guitar and ukulele
this gig bag was just what i needed to carry around a soprano ukelele
i have always been happy with the planet waves products
i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work
hard not to like that
these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand
theres no resistance on that joint so it flops down
good mixers especially for multitrack recording can be complex and difficult to learn
the build quality of the super champ x2 is largely excellent
had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not elixir
keep it mind it is xlr for those that havent noticed
not much else to say
its pretty basic but really good for a beginner
the box already fell down 4 times i got small kids
the classic fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth
aside from that though great product
it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that
the stool is very sturdy no rocking no swaying no moving at all
right product at the right price
of course guitar strings can be a personal preference
that was not the case
it supplies my microphones every time i run out
the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting
in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder
you will not be dissappointed at all
pick wearing is virtually nonexistent and i utilize altpicking a lot in my practices
sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesnt make cases
didnt harm the finish at all
so in a way this is the most important pedal you can have
i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal
these strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time
this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well
what else can i say
the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything
so add 10 to get more than 30 minute in tune play here
onehand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner
i couldnt believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price
good brand and good tone
they are still usable as decent picks
no power cord was included in mine or manual
your sound will come out through your speakers as intended
5 feet same as 6 inches right
two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes
oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills
enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees
the products work great applied them to my new les paul ukulele for protection
do not buy  it is a wast of money
but all in all works well
this works and i really like evans
switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal
delay on tuning low e string2
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone
then a friend told me hed switched from the thomastiks to these
so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes
this stuff will lube up your strings pretty well
the mike in the picture looked bluish to me
this one works better than anyone i have tried
i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it
very small changes can have large effects
it is perfect in controlled stationary environments like home studios
rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the daddario flatwound
love that i didnt have to assemble this stand
its made of serious aluminum and the spring is supersolid
i have returned the unit
inexpensive to purchase  easy to mod to your liking
comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding
they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone
intonation is good and ive noticed less breakage as well
these tuners look and feel great
this is an original gibson gear replacement part
my music partner says she prefers the way these silkandphosphor blend with her fiddle
solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly
just nothing with the name joyo on it
it folds and is definitely portable
it just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands
this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitechs tl2
instantly i was in love
darn near as near to an uncoated string that youre going to find
i use this on all my households guitars and basses
restrung my guitar with no problems
upper fret access is really good
my item arrived lightning fast
at lt20 this is a great bargain but it is a very basic bag
i have even sold the picks at garage sales 25 cents each
it works and i feel comfortable with it supporting my axe
so i took a chance on this little stompbox from china
i can honestly tell a difference
its easy to take on and off
for what its supposed to do it works very well
that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit
you will not be dissappointed at all
but compared to a buddys roland and solid state ampeg its downright mellow
because the slinkys are perfect
i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion
thats the price you pay for a flexible pick i guess
cheap so no big loss
if its a new project always drill pilot holes anyway
ive never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion
this is a nicer set
then spend your savings on something else
im sorry but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive
maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb
i am very impressed considering the price
these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass
why didnt i think of this
elixir strings are very nice
it matches my awesome at2035 microphone
3setup the intonation using a tuner
i put these on an epiphone les paul acousticelectric and it sounds so great
dava picks are one of lifes guilty little pleasures
it works as well as other more expensive ones
its an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
the music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion
xlr cables are hard to mess up
i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events
ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time
these  picks  r awsome
get it and see you will be blown away
overall a great little deal for the price
rapidlyfirmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet
the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made
it was my first guitar
i am sure this will give him years of entertainment
my only complaint is that it could be smaller
i say perfection because this amp does exactly what i wanted it to do
you will not regret it
the new driver actually works
when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it
ieutf8qid1357264576sr81keywordsstraplockwhich seem a lot better and more sturdy
the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still
i had a friend with one of these and he loves it
ill have this thing forever
its so simple a child can use it
i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar
the sm57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled
it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit
very satisfied with this one
quality has always been very consistent
one is the bright blue light indicating 34on34
i have an electric and an acoustic hanging up
there are two ways to think of this pedal
there is a lot to think about with a strap lock
it is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions
i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall
also worked great on my 6 strings
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
i would give 5 stars but the manufacturer should provide more information
what a difference with the epiphone
for the money this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use
i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it
delivered in a timely manner
this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up
i needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one
i figure i got at least 249 worth of guitar for 99
another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats
of course they will be elixirs as well
certainly worth every penny you pay for them
but the sound that comes out of that 834 speaker is big
it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune
no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings
wellllllllllll just give it a try
i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up
debatable  clip mechanism  not spring loaded
not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions
i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good
well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this fender amp
great build quality works like it should
the only string ill use
i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings
i took the plunge and ordered one
it gives me the portability i needed to move about my house
this piece of plastic is just terrible
for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around
plug it in via usb and you literally on your way
the footswitch action is smooth quiet and nearly effortless
plays great to the top fret
these strings are performance value and always give me a great sound
metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must
it is more decorative than useful
if so then dont buy this sample pack
then a volume knob a tone knob and thats it
i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box
i like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std
exactly the same as describe here love the sound and easy to play
perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyones pedal board
the 65 deluxe model sounds better with the 57 deluxes cab and vice versa
so i ordered this one to replace it
takes some practice to appreciate all the features
i bought a case of these
i have an abundance of strat parts
every musician should have one of these around
im not sure how much i can say about a mute
my son much prefers the elixir strings
but i just need to stretch them out
best articulate bass string for the money
i use it on my guitars and my banjo
i connected it with mixer alesis 8 input
he absolutely swears by them
once they did communicate they were very unprofessional
those units have their own tone problems but thats another review
to me 1520 is way too much for a guitar hanger
im not a pro by any means
been using these cables for three months now
whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it
my equipment is very secure
for some of you its still a viable option
so far now they sound great feel great
dont even think of using this for music
very sturdy and light enough to easily carry
these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most
made my little martin look almost as good as new
update on reviewjan 9 2013
this is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin
sounds great easy to adjust
no matter i wont be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again
these are great little tuners
i was really surprised at the snark sn5 tuner
i like the dunlop design and price
i was even surprised they included a battery
for the price they are awesome strings
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymore
the c harp was terrible
i can get 4 completely different sounds out of it
this is just good common sense
i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible
so i recommend them but be aware of its limitations
i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads
i recommend it to all aspiring musicians
well made product strong and looks good
adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument
sounds like a million bucks
if youre really an acoustic guitar aficionado youll want to try these
to sum it up i love this guitar
the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived
i would have expected it to cost much more
and holds all strings down completely and easily
this is an extremely versatile pedal
is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet
however i think my rating will remain at 3 stars
first its construction is pretty light weight
this is a great tuner
i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt soundhole cover
lots of looping time simple to use unlimited overdubs
in this case the strings sound good
i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs
looking forward to more tests
are there better tube screamer clones out there
it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it
he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses
that wasnt the case with the first model
the pickup adds a bright clear sound to your instrument without feedback or hassle
they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison
great little pedal for a very reasonable cost
its only fault is its price
the looper is really why i bought this pedal
its a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness
actually it looks like used pedal not like new
yes it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants
replaced everything but the body
this strobe tuner is cable input only
i see some people complaining about the strings
it worked didnt arrive dead
so i reckon each has to find their own
so minus one star for that
andy said that this product is far superior to any other
minor clean up in post
i will probably buy a couple more of these
i use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner
it is heavy which i knew going in
the pedal cuts through and is articulate
you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response
mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body inside
the pegs line up so they drop right in
it can it does and its cheaper than i can still believe
otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great
feels great sounds great theres a little bit of magic in these strings
just get it try it and see if you like it jeez
thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk
thats just how it is
theres simply no place to clip it
compact size makes storage easy
it does what it says
build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten
i wish it was made in america
handy well made small easy to see
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
not high quality but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks
i dont like a pick that is to stiff and i like the grip
i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness
definitely recommend this slide especially for its price
however these ones are great
once i get around to playing with it i will write another review
cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality
still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender 34f34 logo
it does exactly what is expected of it
got it a while back but have just started to explore its capabilities
you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea
i would recommend it to anyone
perfect for hanging displaying your guitars
everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it
bottom line this is a nobrainer
nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all thats needed
and honestly for me thats what i need
it distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though
these strings are great for a 12 string
the clamp is strong enough that it will stay put
ive had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it
and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc
the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture
i had that one first and it is horrible to use
bought another for my strat
are just about all the same
that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia
i really cannot recommend this bag enough
my guitar is absolutely beautiful
ordered a few of these
all in all a perfect buy for the money
put em in your case and dont be unprepared
nice work joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist
no mud clear mids and highs with clashing
shouldnt it have a full battery since it is brand new
but it did the two things i wanted it for
kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point
if yore looking for a new strap i highly recommend this one
ive used it to record my garage band shows
how many high notes will i be hitting on this baby
this is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars
used these for years on sons electric guitars
it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet
this takes the guess work out of tuning your hides
would not buy it for my own guitar
the rubber wont hurt your violin bridge or strings
its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists
it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it
i have used roland and fender amps and pas
this includes taking the time to store them for use
it is a single strip of leather with no padding
i appreciate its compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock
they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product
solid no problems with the solder joints
these are high quality thick guitar picks
sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time
i tried these and they make for much easier action
ive only used plugin types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise
as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals
the price is great im planning to have several of this
it has a fresh lemon scent
the bottom line for me is  it does and it doesnt
they just are not the sound i was looking for
not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords
im not sure what i was expecting
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar
the improvement in tone was immediate  this little guitar sounds pretty darn good
it is not too short as one reviewer complained
they dont sound overdriven they just sound distorted
but it sounds great with singlecoils too
its a very well designed capo
nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls
overall some of the best strings available
this can give some cleans and drive to distortion
probably a centimeter or so wider
yes i spent more than i ever have on a pedal board before
i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner
still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar
i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware
adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some
there are 2 ins and 2 outs 1 balanced1 unbalanced on each channel
add two monitors and youve got yourself a nice little pa
it links well with other pedals
loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone
keep em in every case
its also great for vocals as well
before i bought this i had to use a tuner on my laptop
this is a great stand
i have several brands some more expensive but i always come back to gls
only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds
qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii
i had the red snark and a couple others
this probably doesnt matter to all of yall though
works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from amazon
i have purchased two sets of the mini locking rotomatics
the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use
i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag
a nice pedal to have to be sure
youll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc
ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job
i bought this product to use on my amp pots
my fingers keep hitting the strings
the model number is 333001 probably also discontinued
i will update this review when i have that information
looking back cant see why i really need it
its sturdy and gets the job done
finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless
i highly recommend planet waves cables
just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on
ive used many brand for my guitars for years
i usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days
it is well made and stays on without falling off
stout stable and even looks good
maybe its my signal chain
but you will not hear a difference
i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price
exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money
love the all black look as well
they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly
i have five guitars including two les pauls and they hold them just fine
at this price how can you go wrong
he would definitely purchase from here again
this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars
great foot rest its not flimsy
it wont break the bank and it wont break your back
maybe 5 times in my entire career
responds fast display is incredible
it comes with really nice looking stickers
i have been using dunlop picks for a long time
ends are made of leather
i have a les paulmarshall class 5bb preampep boosteranalog chorus and carbon copy
the tuners are basic but they work well
just to keep picks in my guitar case
i need to have alot of pick speed
this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal
love love love the hastlefree access to my picks
no more dead 9v batteries
its lightweight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck
now all i gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah
from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance
being a studio owner i didnt buy this for stage work
amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem
sound great and look great
what more can i say
these arent the dirtcheap  these actually have some nicer connectors  midgrade level
get it one you will love it
to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
i will always buy snark tuners
it works great to hang a standard size guitar on
ive been playing guitar for more than 20 years
great little controller for your daw or whatever
ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitars neck
what more can i say its a sheet stand
they offer good middle of the road accessories
good idea but it doesnt work
i plan to stick with them
they are easy to install on the bass and the strap
also please check your intonation
you shouldnt be disappointed with this item
for years i have used a kyser capo because i like the trigger action
sounds good with both guitars  especially neck and center positions
beautiful solid tone and no buzzing
i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for 6 strings
i love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals
come on capos dont have 34tone
i had to give it a shot
so because of the limitations i rate it as above
the design is really pragmatic and effective
this daisy chain worked very well for me  no problems yet
and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use
all have their good and bad points
easily worth the extra dollar
it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass
wow im really impressed with this tuner
i get a good clean sound on my vocals
i stuck some repurposed rubber feet on the bottom
a review mentioned it didnt come with batteries
some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use
tuners old style not sealed
also compact and very durable
i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more
all i can say is wow
does its job very nicely
recommended to one and all
and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing
super stable and doesnt take up much space
get it you wont be sorry
but these are just wish list items
this unit is like a old blue jeans
feel like its a tricky rebate
quality product at a good price
first impression of the guitar was terrible
a little nicer than i thought it would be
i use them with my pedal board and havent any issues with signal quality
this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved
the accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings
its simple and works well
i never use it so i really only wasted my money
i like cool gadgets  and this is no exception
i would buy another one if i lost this one
recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all
had issues before with company but they resolved all issues
its like any other snark super tight tuner
if the unthinkable happened id buy another one in a heartbeat
a good old standard that ive used since i was a kid
but this is the switch for that amp
this item has sewnseamed edges that will not fray
if i would have paid 20 on this strap i would be furious
today i had one of those finds
a fender aftermarket product that didnt come with some sort of defect or problem
if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one
get one and have fun
the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use
its fun to use and also very challenging
i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word
the locking mechanism is strong
therefore after playing i always wipe down my strings to extend their life
the adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees
the cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew
can double as a mic or boom stand
ive owned them for a few months now
it keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely
very nice product and fits well and good quality
the switch is also loose
i tried it on the boom arm and it made it topheavy and unstable
it cuts your changing time down drastically
if youre looking to buy a capo id recommend this over a kyser
i buy tons of them all the time
this is the stand you remember from the band room
i am very pleased with the product
very nice effects on both channels
once hooked up i was very surprised how flimsy it is
i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal  what a difference
the xls are comparable in gauge to ernie ball regular slinky yellow
great product and one that i will continue to use
i think its time to sell them off
i am confused by this hellish portal of confusion
essentially a waste of money
the plate was delivered on time and as promised by amazon
the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning
works like it is suppose to good quality
the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good
well built and looks even better in person than the picture
i enjoy playing this thing so much
fender makes a nice standard pick
simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines
the ampjack is chromemetal backplated to the body its not coming loose
after consistent use its going strong
like always boss products are just amazing
just place it upside down
for under 10 and prime eligible what more can you ask for
it works well i mean it doesnt crumble apart or anything
well here it is friends in all its glory
if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs6
i think what happened is i just left it on too long
i have one of these and the amount of detail is great
just good ol genuine fender parts
it fits snugly but well
these are very well constructed and function very well too
more than worth it though
i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks
it has no paperwork or owners manual
i am very glad i got the h2
nice sturdy and portable case
they are a little flimsey but are ok
it does whats its suppose to do
as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall
these picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick
very portable though the holder can be a challenge at times
it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble
weight is pleasantly light and the semigloss finish is comfortable to the touch
and the functionality is great
it functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun
but it does the function perfectly
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound
this product meets all my expectations
this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting
ive got a bunch of these little tuners i keep one with each instrument
now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want
im more blues orientated now and love it at the end
this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without
this acessorie is well builded and dont change the guitars pitch
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely
i have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables
any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally
i have however had a slight issue with certain d strings
i bought him a set of these
the factory presets  61120 are not modifiable
what else can be said that isnt implied in the title of this review
as far as longevity and durability time will tell
what can i say i am a string snob
you can pay more and get less
a must have for any blues player
even without strap locks im comfortable going crazy on stage
these nyxls from daddario are definitely in that notch above category
im not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing
padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion
if youve read some of my other reviews you know im a serial hotrodder
the metal musthave will be in the family a while i can tell
as clean as a marsh possum
great cord for the money
i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul
unlike other cheap chinesemade ripoffs ahem
i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box
my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic
also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it
8 opened garageband got  no input message
the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected
they are also in a good color so they dont stand out too much
first its all tube so it sounds really good
bb is displayed as a
output of high quality material also sounds superb
i dont hate any of them
i have used monster cables for years and with good reason
this product puts my older laptop besides newer ones
get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain
make sure you order the right size
rubber washers come with to size for different necks
it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well
this is not a great quality microphone
it is hard to describe the sound you woul dhave to hear it
great stand durable folds down nicely and really does the job
the simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat
i used daddarios for many years
worthless and its now holding my sons 34 size classical guitar barely
its a quick release with the buckle
all in all this is a great product
a nice strap for my lower tier guitars
oh well i went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead
well i must say i am very happy with the purchase
they are just faster and easier
on the plus side for soloing you cant go wrong with these
i started experimenting on strings ill try using bronze strings
still using it today 2 years later
switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm
the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo
both of those elements are present on this signature amplug
better yet refund my money for the product i paid  minus shipping
i have issued the refund of 704
a monkey could have written a better driver
i got it for my son and he wasnt impressed
the tone destroys the line 6 and the features crush the vox pathfinder 6watt
i should have totally returned this product
if youre a metal or hard rock player dont buy this
but variable speed would have been nice
i havent had to change mine in almost two years since ive had it
this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar
what more could you want
i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin
it is small and doesnt look like a huge lump on the headstock
in addition to all the other fx too
the strap locks do work
it does just what i wanted it to do
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
its hard to beat the quality of monster cables
it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring
the picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order
i have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart
great extra light polyweb strings for guitar
until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders
easy to do and youll notice an immediate increase in distortion
it is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard
these provided an easy inexpensive solution
i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo
i didnt know headphones could sound this good
its not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me
every acoustic is different though
this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to
closing thoughts unfortunately there really isnt a usb interface that has a good driver
very nice grip on these
first you guys who complain about the plastic housing
manual should have been include not sure about the cord
so i found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine
quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well
doesnt leave the strings oily or full of residue
whatever engineer was in charge of this  you screwed up big time
they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway
i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons
dont get me wrong the sans amp is still great
works on everything i own which is 3 acoustics and 1 gretsch hollow body
the ditto is great for practice though
beyond the halfway setting it wouldve hurt my ears
ive been using elixir strings for many years
it is not cheap but it is well made and useful
price them at a store and you will come back here
i like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack
great tone great string life with a little maintenance and very reasonably priced
other than a great display and accurate tuning
so far ive had no problems
this product works just fine
now could you use it for a gig
i should have gotten the 15 foot but you live and learn
added 08nov2010  the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing
it fits well on my les paul and strat
got this tuner for my new bass
i use it a lot on my practice rig
its simple easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound
love this capo on my electric guitar
dont waste your time with this
not too much to say about a cable
even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end
i dont notice much difference at all though
it can do some strange things and get unique sounds
good sustain and strings are holding up well
no matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound
but if your gonna use it live
very easy to use  clip on and go
bottom line  every guitarist should have one
ill always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board
i thought i could take the smell
spend a few more bucks and get a padded one
fabulous clean tone and great distortion sound running off a solidstate amp and pedals
they really are the better string
it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight
it takes a while for the shipping but thats stated in the description
anyway it all comes down to preference i suppose
looked at a lot of cases most priced 90 or above
i wholeheartedly endorse the product
you cant go wrong with these guys
great little amp to mess around with
quality strings do sound different and nearly as importantly they feel good too
i know ill never be able to blow it away
but the instructions say it should be fine
note that there is no guitar cable
but these ones really get the guitars shining up really nice
it is well crafted and cheap
still enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use
i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand
i would still prefer classic style
if you dont mind spending the time to learn all its capabilities its great
for such a little thing
in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively
for the money you cant find a better deal
you cant go wrong with these
my mom bought me this one
i am pleased with my purchase
can sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars
it is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back
i gave one to my grandnephews
very clean quiet and durable
i re soak it easy 23 weeks or so
the tried and true shubb works great at a great price
you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible
ive had good success with this piece
i have a few shure sm58s which cost more
a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it
very satisfied with how it worked
these are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong
it looks like it will last too
the two together make a nice portable recordingproduction combination
i ordered two of this item on 0318
i was warned about the shielding but i havent experienced an issues yet
the great features are 1
this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole
ive used the fx600 for a couple of years
no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music
the packaging was also a bit confusing
the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about 18 inch
i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them
for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use
ill never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this
now im glad i chose this one
i love the red the swivel head the green
i cannot begin to tell you how much i love this guitar
the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth
its quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily
all of my 734 tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits
this mic in a studio application smokes them
all these harmonicas in one case and they sound great
these can take it and come back for more
a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin
it looks and fits just as shown in the picture
great seller and fast delivery
uncolored 20db of clean gain
simply fantastic piece of equipment
all pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar
the clean tones on this are just great
i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home
i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable
this is my first mixer
bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal
overall a good deal for the price
2 i use the black white and blue colors
they sound great and are priced right
i have it custom mapped for multiple softwares
the result was very sore fingers
these perform well on single coils specifically telecasters
these snark tuners are really cool
i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain
and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do
my bass is not that old but really needed to be cleaned and polished
the latest 34bargain basement34 squier strat bullet is no exception
i just wonder what other people have encountered
the head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily
its fun and easy to record my own songs
it is simple and does its job well
i lost one and had to buy another one
you dont know how good youve got it
so these are  pretty great strings
in a much much more obvious way3
mine has a white case
any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use
there is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke
this is fun and easy to do
after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured
often times it even stay in tune the next days
i bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room
this strap is pretty thin
and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce
im pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sps
in order to be used effectively the tuning space must be relatively quiet
weighs a ton cool logo made in usa
it works great and looks better
i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on
it gets the job done easily and very fast
the anchors stayed in the wall
you simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it
cheap price and does the job
is there anything else to say
despite this installing them was quite easy
good for my small space though
these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality
these are such comfortable picks
i bought primarily for travel and im pleased with my purchase
its a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff  love these patch cables
dont miss out on this great deal
very pleased always have a spare pair in your case
so i tried this cable and it works perfectly
but its not light weight
so much sustain for a bolt on neck
i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one
the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read
i just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting
they were perfect for my pedal board
but i have no concerns after using it on two string changes
i keep various guitar picks clips pencils etc
a perfect match for the original i replaced
im a beginner and is more than enough for now
ive been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great
way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic
so while i got this for my soprano ukulele
easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments
so the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens
all in all id say the design of this is very user friendly
seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far
the shoulder rest is kinda useless though
the issues include what i think may be premature breakage
used mildly it gives the sound a more natural feel
it gets softer with time and use
they dont touch the floor
really close but they were terrible in operation
well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa
they are ctls so im a bit confused
it hasnt seen heavy use
but its a fine guitar
they stand out too much
the adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably
in case you were wondering this is a clone of the boss compressorsustainer
they also sound good with any settings i use
now it looks beautiful again
using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks
i would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on
stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal
ive been using daddario xl strings since the 80s
size and fit were good
my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion
i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life
the heavy bottons 32 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone
he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny
one is the stock reverb
this item really speaks for itself
the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made
no desire to test other strings
the pedal itself works perfectly fine
i think tascam would be wellserved taking that into account
nothing gave me better tuning on the first try
i was surprised that it was good
the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way
what can one say about a cable
looks like 18x18 to me
they are not too stiff or too flimsy
this one was cheap and does the job
for the price this is an excellent case
bluray surround with the band was just amazing
well i must say this thing rocks
also i couldnt see any effect between engagingdisengaging the tone button
more versatile than the sovereign
i can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke i want inside
it seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around
they need to fix the info on their web page
pretty cool knockoff of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo
ive had it on for 2 and a half months now with no problems
very good sound quality plenty of gain
they sound wonderful and cost very little
received this item in good time
its about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball
perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties
you will notice that some areas soak it more than others
its just soso in my estimate but in some cases soso is good enough
it just might not be your sound
the bands on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job
worth the money and is built well
i was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so
easy on the fingers too
will order again if needed
this is a pretty cool product
i also like the xlr connectors on these havent had one go bad yet
it is extremely silent save any noise i would generate anyway from my rig
if it breaks ill post about it
so i do carry and use these occasionally but they arent my everyday pick
just remember the key words  slow and gentle
this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice
i used the daddario j53 black nylon strings
it even comes with a handy pick holder
sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose
even without a guitar and an amp its still fun to have
this product is simple does the job and is well priced
i couldnt be more pleased
but that is only a personal opinion
ive tried every standard pick  even bone silver  really expensive ones
this little guy worked just as advertised
okay i bought a 1966 telecaster brand new back then
they have a very comfortable feel and great sound
i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars
great gig bag for acoustic guitar
this is a great little tuner and i recommend it
the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward
if its there i missed it
for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do
i keep it on all the time since it always improves soundquality
it is very sturdy and very stable
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
i never had a problem with their stuff
fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume
i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it
have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon
so if youre looking for a vocalpodcast mic this is a great cheap option
but after purchasing i realized that a tool like this isnt too necessary
a great investment thatll last quite a long time
the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe
ive always been partial to nickel wound particularly semiflatwound but i digress
i had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram
seems really sturdy and well made
the fact that it is wide is nice
i am extremely impressed with this great guitar
crystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console
i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit
keeps wireless unit very snug and tight
but these pitch blacks are not bad
ive read the revues and some dont do them justice
these are shred picks they are very accurate
i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos
other than that the strings are just a little squeaky
it just feels good in your hands
this one is not so stiff and is very well built
i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks
they sound good to me
the leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps
this modtone here seems solidly constructed
i used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show
i am thinking about getting a 2nd one
so in short id buy it again
i bought this for my daughter for christmas
i have one thats over 4 years old and still going strong
you dont have this guitar
i am sure i will get more
i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings
the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
while it isnt it the prettiest guitar out there its by no means ugly
the guitar has good tone and action
i have more use for an overdrive
mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar
i like much more than the joyo fuzz
saw this in tv yellow and had to have it
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too
purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my sons acoustic guitar
as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home
you can get some insane sounds out of it
but you can get them ultimately
the size is 34just right34 not too small or big
very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs
i use it every week and it still sounds perfect
bright and warm at the same time
perfect for its intended use
they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity
will buy more in future
imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity
just pure creative sound that wont break the bank
actual description is a blasted 34design34 which is what you get
and of course they sound excellent too
it didnt smell like the other reviews said either
i use the green 88mm picks and also the orange 60mm ones
i dont know but i am satisfied with this purchase
it could be that the string included is a cheap one
the competitors that ive tried do not
intonation is spot on looks beautiful too
but you need to attach it with something
i am going to look for a decent one
in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box
first of all its huge
with this new capo i am happy to use it
these blue steel light strings sound like gold
lets be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes
seems to me as good as any connector ive ever bought
basically the cherub is just too sensitive
i have a 180 amp but was looking for something a little more portable
ive got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed
i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it
not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer
if this is the case spend the money to get a nicer filter
i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else
switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull
i really love monster cables
all in all a pretty good device
i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little
this is a handy little contraption
i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line
these exp16s are superior to them all
the pedal works as described
i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass
this one is the most basic
it was cheap and affordable
excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised
for the price its worth it i guess
it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined
there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases
you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc
as the description says this is a mild overdrive
winds the strings fastpulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wiredoes not scratch my guitar
the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator
finally i gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely
just gotta love that vibe
i have a tech 21 bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs
they sound good on a variety of models like sgles paul rickenbacker
if you are looking for a small plug and play amp
i fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability
the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be
the answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking for
this is a 5 star stand considering the price
perfect for restringing your guitar
there is little to fault with it
and yes pop filters are a must with condenser microphones
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it
i am glad i did
but for casual use this one is completely fine
thus any uke that is concert size or greater
its the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place
but i discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds
pocketsized headphone amps and so on
daddario always makes great products at great prices
the shielding on these planet waves cables are great
i have two of these
i use the  exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads
whenever i played with traditional strings my fingertips would turn green
its built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely
it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp
from experience they tend to just die without notice
you can dial it right in to get that srv sound
cause thats what this bad boy or girl to be pc does
2 make sure you know what length you need for a cable
its soft without being limp
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
this is a fun pick
these flex steels are excellent
i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them
if you buy 34items sold from amazon34 you can depend on free shipping
i highly recomend this guitar
the battery cover on mine fits very loosely
thats been a few years ago
once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was
im sure there are better ones but for me this works well
been playing for 30 years and i have used tube screamers extensively
without this i would be lost
mixed bag and at 200 shouldnt be
the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone
i record to daw and the recordings sound fine
use at your own risk
the neck feels silky smooth
if i used it a with a passive guitar pickup id want external preamp
and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled
it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down
it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes
not a issue with manufacturer but dont drop it too hard
these stands are just what i wanted for my studio
my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds
i bought my first pack over 7 years ago and ive been hooked
worth every penny mind you
i use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern
this mic is good considering the price
in life you mostly get what you pay for
all i can say is wow
he found just what he needed and at a great price
i compared this to a vox valve modeling amp not even a contest
in my sample of 2 it made highend guitars sound worse
when i first started on guitar i put
so i thought it would bea good opportunity to try a 34nonstandard34 strap
to my ears its not in the same spot on all presets
this one is good just that i regret paying so much for it
very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician
and was way cheaper then the line6 adapter
like many have mentioned this pedal is like a ts but without the midhump
it does almost everything i need
authentic replacement screws if you need them
if not for the hum it would get 5 stars
and before you ask 34is it perhaps your output jack
hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music
ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo
this is incredibly easy to use right out of the package
he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more
what more is there to say
however this product is wonderful
i bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out
but it does a good enough job for what it is
the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesnt alter your tone
it is growing on me and i wouldnt part with it now
great mic for the price
i love the fact that this controller has full size keys
simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp
but i like the build quality and the speed control
overall im happy with this brand
they work and they last
this is a great small gig or practice amp
this strap works fine on my fender strat
i didnt notice much of a difference between these and runofthemill daddario strings
the trigger is a rocker switch
it came today like the computer said it would
again its very good at what it does if you dont power the microphone
i wont hold it against these windscreens
this works very well for all of them
they sound great and stay in tune
provides a cool bright clean white light and will cover three or four pages
this one is definitely the best
it works awesome with electric guitar too
i bought 2 of these as controllers for my alesis drum machine
it would keep me from buying another one of these
whatever the waveform is its not a sine wave not smooth at all
a straight up product well worth the money
theres not much to say about this pick
the classic vibe 60s strat really impresses me through this amp
it might work in a busker situation
there is also an embossed model brown offered at minimumly higher price
the reason is its not designed properly
simple to use works well on the squier strat
a more forward lead guitar sound
my first experience with levy and completely satisfied
its bulky but it works well
we learned to play thanks to this kit
the tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful
i guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection
ive only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so
playabilty is very good with low action and good tone
they sound so full and strong
no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going
too low and it does not sound right
i prefer a string with a little more volume
they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock
this pedal covers the 34white room34 by cream tone perfectly
i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led
i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail
an all around tough mic
i would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point
these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on
in this case you can look forward to getting a great product here
i bought this amp for my 7 year old son
surprisingly loud really its amazing that much sound comes out of that thing
in comes the planet waves
our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready
comes out as easy as it goes in
joyo continues to surprise me
capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary
the sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost
an excellent value and a great gift idea too
been using it for a month or 2 now
mostly it goes in a pocket
ive installed them on every fender i own
thats not bad in itself
the adjustable parts are easy to use
i would imagine it weighs about 1014lbs
all their cords are quit and are quality produces
this case will definitely do the trick
i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts
i will never be without one again
i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome
it wont give you the brown sound
wouldnt trust it again so i returned them
and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out
perfect chain for most rock sounds
increases projection and tone to any stock strings
nice as a tabletop effect
good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes
i like on stage stuff
describing its sound with words helps but doesnt really do it justice
they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase
this amp is for you
this is probably the least useful part of the amp
i will buy these again
easy to use and very secure
works very well and is portable
it does its job and its well worth the money
at that price its an amazingly good deal
i had the boss looper with 2 pedals and it was noisy on playback
overall a four stars product imo
i have nothing but praise for them
some of them had the white dot some didnt therefore they didnt look uniform
i like it korg has never disappointed me
this is the perfect amp for bed practice
and they produce no audible hum into the circuit
i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal
also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek 5881s for jj 6l6gcs
i have a monster m rock12 cable
this one by far evolved from good design
i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name
it makes restringing way easier its pretty stable and sturdy
i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash
you wont be disappointed with this amp
these are fairly pricey but i am very impressed with the quality
i recommend this cable without reservations
one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button
highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro
link to a bass amp or subwoofer and you definitely have full sound
you can stick it to the guitar
what more could you want
but no harm done still works great
bought it to hear how my harmonicas would sound amped
this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied
this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money
i intentionally got the jf02 after reading positive reviews all over the net
are they better than the 100s
i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong
overall great entry level interfacesound card
i just save the fast 34lower played34 songs for last
i also have a danelectro  fab echo and this just blows it away
the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely
somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain
and a note about the looks
pros  inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal
that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy onoff
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order
they fit one of mine perfectly and another not very well
this amp cable is perfect
comes with a power supply
the switch is conveniently located on top of the light
easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em
helps greatly to control acoustic feedback
and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful
theyre also awesome for live recording use as a monitor
it still would not install
i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards
i originally rated this pickup 5 stars
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer
has a nice smell works like a charm
for a regular venue i have an extra marshall 500watt speaker system
they are all bold and in your face
other mics i own dont have this problem to this degree
i ordered one the next day
and daddario never produces junk
what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere
this isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what youre getting
the beams are narrow but you get two of them
i love this little tuner
well i love da fender products always have always will
i like emeven if they are purple
it seems sturdy and well built
yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space
i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard
with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else
easy to use easy to read and has options that i dont even use
it works perfect with my boss pedals
great product for a great price
the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package
it fills out the sound and yet doesnt add any artificial high end
made me able to use a strap on my guitar
no more winding string wraps around the tuning post
i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup
and on the mims fenders either cause both of mine are american standards
flawless comes to mind here
and there is room for more if i need it
probably would be improved with a set of aguilas
its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside
the percussion loops are fine  at least provide solid guides for recording
i do mixing and voice overs so i needed the real deal
what more do i need to say
my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding
sorry  i had rather not comment until it is used
that really worked well to tune the guitar
a bit small for my preference
this makes it very comfortable
the sound is kind of acoustic guitarukulele banjo ish
wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh
very useful for connecting rack components between
works perfectly with audacity and windows 7 plug and play
i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned
they continue to work to this day
great stand for the price
this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded
i was surprised at the sound that this amp produces
it sounds great and it has loads of power
a bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good
it is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream
the orange gearlux logo looks pretty cool too
there is absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks of any kind
the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele
concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger
this left the saddle too low to the neck
it is no lightweight either
there are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators metronomes etc
i write and record my own music
and for the price you really cant beat it
i wish it had a power switch
adding to that is its convenient small size and being unbelievably cheap price
using this on my ibanez art100 electric guitar
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
for the working musician or home recording man this is great
what can i sayi love this thing
works great for that and for uke
good little tuner at a steal of a price
theres too much tension to do it with your fingers
bottom line is elixirs sound great play well and least a really long time
i dont own a strat so i cant comment on single coils through it
first of all i am a beginner
the string cutter works better than expected
restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color
probably will never stop buying them
i wasnt expecting pro level gear for a sub 100 pedal
i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech
i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment
it has great sound and distorts like its suppose to
this is a clean simple amp to use
these are really cheap strings but how they sound
i like daddario strings but these did not impress me
and the price it right
its good for keeping things from getting too buzzy
i lost my trusty slide and really miss it
best distortion i ever used
i bought this guitar nearly a year ago
i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back
they sound better more prefessional
1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack
i used to use fender medium picks only
high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best
i love this little tuner
it has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone short or tall
even in perfect condition its still a subpar case
it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price
this little instrument tuner does everything
trustable quiet good materials durable etc
needless to say im not very pleased
the quick release and secure connection are great
the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some
these strings are just prefect and feel awesome
the destortion works well enough
at first it didnt work
the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier
finish stitching and adjustments are quality
so i snapped one up just like everyone else
for this price its another great tool for your arsenal
maybe i will try it again at some point but
it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have
im going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good
this pedal is tubescreameresque but not as midrangeheavy as a ts
every bass player should have one of these
not to mention how great they look
behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it
i love the little thing
great microfiber polishing cloth for a great price
i knocked it to 4 stars because they dont match up
i highly recommend this tuner
but i havent dented anything yet so perhaps im just too skeptical
the thing is dense and build solid as a rock
this strap is very long if you need it to be
see my other reviews on these pedals
these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive
the colorcoded end balls help with the restringing
it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table
i got this for use with the boss dd20 as a taptempo
the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird
used them for years  always loved them
the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6
for hifi music recording however youll notice it is a cheap mic
the thing is that they dont seem to stay
this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank
the digital reverb has a spacious feel
i do have my eye on a martin though
its fine if no one hears you
this fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along
very good tray to put small items
rubber no skid bottom is a plus
stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully
you cant honestly ask for more
what more can a guy say about a little box of screws
it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off
it is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects
changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore
i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly
he liked the result when i switched out the gt 12ax7
first and foremost this amp is amazing
make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance
ideal for gigs as well as studio and home
these picks are nice but just  too small
would it be only a one trick pony
outlets 182113 can all be used to power either 9v or 12v pedals
made from good materials and is attractive
great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations
i tried it in the key of g and got useful results
it will polish and lube things like floyd roses
these strings are what i use on all  of my acoustic guitars
no matter how i adjust it it has a muddy sound
i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup
i own many tuners and clip ons of many other brands
what really can you say about switchcraft they just make good solid parts
quality product for a good price
have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them
why else would you be reading this
if you want a cheap childs gimictype toy this is for you
each string is labeled so you know which goes where
i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals
as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and roadrugged
it is a  great product
one star only for this product
this is the least expensive holder i could find nov 2013
it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine
im thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin
i didnt expect them to  but a guy can dream cant he
theyre fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying
i didnt remember where id gotten it or even the manufacturer
and it did the same with a usb phone
needed a boost with my headphones while playing rocksmith
after a while it just stopped working
this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps
ive been a musician for over 40 years
i compared this against the fostex mr8mkii which i also own and like
for quiet practice youre best getting a vox amplug imho
they are wellshielded look nice and handle well
you dont need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt
once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner
that said  the ds1 does exactly what i wanted it to
im not sure if this is normal or not
the sound is a little too electronic for me
other than the price the strings work great on my guitar
when i wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth
and no im not hawking epiphone
this little dude does a great job
and the string winder itself also works well
the mounting process was simple
based on other reviews i made my purchase
a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality
does not get me excited
i have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades
the rogue analog delay is wellconstructed and feels very high quality given the price
hopefully this review will be usefull to you
for blues jazz or light rock its brilliant right out of the box
heres where you get those strings
that being said this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi
no noticeable noise added to my ears
all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days
its the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument
first i want to make clear that this is a dark bassy pedal
otherwise it would be a 5 star
i got it because i need a second tuner
been using the snark tuners for while now
the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use
over all i think daddario is great for warm balance tones
i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail
i have them turned all the way down almost
sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs
this was what i needed and it was cheap
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar
this little gem is worth its weight in gold
i finally got it and saw how great it is
these tuning machines are great
i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under 5 minutes
the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well
otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years
perfect size for us big guys
it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances
no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness
the second one i tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage
ive found that the light picks
and its a great midi controller
phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful
still a great product though
i narrowed it down to 3  korg aw2 snark sn1  intelli imt900
you will like them on the guitar
btw thats all i have to say so dont make me type more
i was not a fan of this particular capo
nice texture and it doesnt affect the sound of my mics
they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability
second unit too had the similar packing but no damages
good life they sound good for a couple of months
they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner
that was a disappointment for another reviewer for me its a plus
but i like it because its cheap light and it works
i even like it with the bass
who invented this thing heman
im sure it wont wear out any time soon either
5 feet 6 but actually are 10
if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have
now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners
overall this is a very good capo and i can recommend it without hesitation
my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs
some nice picking with this pick
but wow at this price how can one gripe
you cant beat this deal
its pretty hard to mess these up
i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl
i have several of these
works plugged in or unplugged
thats okay hes got competition and ill be purchasing from them instead
the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings
on a personal level id prefer it didnt say epiphone on the outside
easy to understand with responsive controls
the mic has a headphone jack
it works great though and for the price its wonderful
this proves that easy helps
its a boss its solid  and a great price
i have one of these in every one of my cases
with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers
the carrying case is also nice
id buy this again without hesitation though
theyre not bad but dont expect them to last like elixirs do
i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great
either way it works well
it sounded like i was in a great concert hall
once you setup your pedalboard
skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc
the cradle guitar stand was for a friend
so i had no bass control
i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit
all strings must be kept clean if you want them to last
so stop thinking about it and just go buy it
i have owned almost every octaveharmonizerpitch shifter on the market
i use it the most of all my pedals because its pretty much perfect
i wont be buying these again
but they block sound so well you dont have to blast them
they do the job well
bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me
best buy on the market
roland fender line6 and others still have that niche dialed in
it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices
but after they stretch out a little they sound perfectly fine
it was easy to install
this item was received well packed and on time
theyre easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound
but all are for radiused fingerboards
this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful
i prefer shars overture premieres which are the same price
sorry i dont like these as theyre just too big
i think its the way they trail off
this product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars
i know theyre more expensive but youll be happier off in the long run
works well with the axl pg515
for the price 30 shipped it cant be beat
great quality very strong and great variation of length on them
i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs
the leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps
it does and it does it well
it is perfect for what it is
i got the wrong size holder
other than that its fine and pretty well constructed
this made me take a second look at schaller
both harps very bendable etc
the mount has exceeded my expectations
just what i have expected
the spherical receiver makes the xm8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands
this pedal was priced very well 32 and had nearly a 5 star rating
but the rub is their nonadaptability
these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors
if you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more
the neck had a huge bow in it
i have one of these as well as several other microphones
i used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems
overall my favorite snark model and my favorite clipon tuner
this is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players
you can power any lightweight 9v 12 or 18v stompbox with this
my fingers just couldnt do it for extended play
phantom power and data transfer has been flawless
the samson tech support was friendly enough but not very helpful
smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings
whats even better is how long they last
any smaller and it would be going in the trash
stay away from this one and get a better used pedal
i used it in acoustic guitar and on the ukelele without any problem
i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs
however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar
ive tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound
i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else
trust me ive played for 13 years
however the price was great and the sound is good
lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months
sent it back and did not reorder
from nasty blues to steppenwolf you will have it covered
a quality pedal that should hold up well
well i have to say that it did well
i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times
placed one in a fender blues junior
i love for my practice rig
as a veteran bluseman i recommend it
works like its supposed to
for such a small combo this amp really packs a punch
the lead cuts clean 34mostly34
using  the 12vac output on my fuel tank chameleon works great
other than that the strap is of good quality
as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that
i tested this and yes it does go louder for whatever the reason
i am looking to change if i can find something else
i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune
everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem
clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio
it tuned up very easily and for me it holds tune nicely
i just wasnt at the right height
but jameson guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price
they sound good they are light weight
you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick
lots of relief between strings and body
i then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick
i hear it can be used on other boss and roland gear
id been looking a taylors but didnt want to spend that much money
i figure 12 dozen will last me for years
my first one arrived not working at all
i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor
i just decided to eat the loss
update  121912still working great after 5 months
not the best but not the worse
back to the drawing board i go
i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly
these strings actually save you money because you dont have to change em much
easy to use accurate programmable lights up easy to read decent quality
fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky
turn it on clip it on and tune
but since it does its a good place to hide a 3000 gibson 335
but overall its a great product
i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying
switching to these 10s made a huge difference in tone
but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio
this tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion
this is a beautiful guitar
so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked
i had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing
but passable id return it if i could
i am enjoying this guitar
wipe them down with a little dr
big and wide enough to handle any guitar
does what it is suppose to do
the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze
so its back to the fenders
your attitude and hands create the sound in the end
i bought two more as presents
it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface
check youtube theres plenty on this great price pedal
the tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great
one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune
definitely holds the guitar well
i am using three guitars on stage when possibleroom permitting
i do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable
the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup
construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis
many musicians use two delay pedals
nice airlinesized bottle w safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening
i also use one on my pedal board wouldnt use anything else
the guitalele measures 2712 x 9 x 234 at their widest points
before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen
this package of picks is of good colors and good weight
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15
these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing
the only way to turn it off is to unplug it
i got 4 replacememts over 3 years
other than that for the price its just awesome
i love adding channels to amps and that is exactly what this pedal does
i have been using the behringer acx450 for six months now
they are made well  last
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would
im really happy with this pedal
this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric
lack of a mid control
it sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made
this cable expands the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v adapter
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks
its so darn simple to use
decent strings dont cost very much
ive bought 4 of these over the past couple of years
that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words
of worlds crappiest pot metal
you can get excellent instructions and tips on youtube
this thing is a little jewel
i mean you pay for a quality instrument right
also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables
but come on this stuff is just fine
these strings are really nice
it works the same and is pretty durable
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good
this is too short for most adults that play guitar
i tried all different knob and eq settings as well
seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it
the leather is rather soft
no problems until i got to the g string then pop another breaker
they also came with two velcro ties each
id be lost without this tool
does fine on hard floors
they are absolutely fantastic for the price
the tuner hole size is
every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support
you can never have too many guitars
no humhiss from these units at all
nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great
however i may have added too much humidity
rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like theyll last a while
my guitar had an 11hole pickguard
i did not want to spend a lot to start
save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar
it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear
they were a good price though and they fill a niche that i need
in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input
distilled water will extend the life of the sponge
no changing hardware like strap locks
especially the acoustic version of these
it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do
im a fender fan but this beats their single switch
2 all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit
i have dozens of them they never wear out
the bag is well padded and not to expensive
i know silly but i was not paying attention
guitar slips a little off my knee
which i have not tried
the price is dead cheap
even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing
this one produces a great tone and is wellmade
therefore your strings last much longer
they took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event
the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use
everything was good except for that one microphone
yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of
it effectively quiets all my other pedals
they are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them
it is like the swiss army knife for string winding
it is very robust versatile good looking and not very expensive
i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different
not that i ever use it
it seemed to work very well in this role
i compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own
acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one
compared to ernie balls cloth its good enough for wiping down things
the feedback is good and theyre stiff enough to strike clear tones
like the black and it holds well
my banjo arrived a couple days after i ordered it
this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming
i use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming
it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package
i have other similar models and they are all great
martins are no doubt excellent strings
you can get pretty decent sound out of this
honestly to protect this better theyd have had to contact tony stark
its a small smart tuner
set echo for multiple head repeats
the bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge
update  i have had this pedal now for about 1 12 years
the only strings i get are ernie ball strings
fuzz 1 is a creamy midrange filled sound
i love the quality and the sound
this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player
right out of the box the hd 500 totally blew me away
thanks to amazon for offering such a good product
this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand
good quality bag for my epi lp
so i popped in this kk
on tv theyre sold for 80
ease of use and durable
i love this capo better than any i have seen or used
these are good cables at a good price
if the end leathermaterial is too thick the lock wont fit
i like that the pedal has a wide array of uses
its relatively inexpensive small and light weight
great tuner just bought 8 of them for xmas presents
the brightest tone normal lifespan fair prices and louder than the rest
so why only three stars
i dont need to worry about batteries any more
however ive been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
if your household is quiet this is very much a good bargain
these do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior
they still work years later
however that tuner had at least two limitations
dava 6024 grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey
the best i8217ve used so far
as for quality it has an unconditional guarantee see above
i think everyone has used fender mediums at some point these are no different
for regular sized picks its a perfect product
awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use
it seems much more twitchy than the sn1
they are fun and kitschy
its easy and clear and everything a tool should be
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
the pop sound is completely removed with the filter
some other functional comments about it
lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos
switchcraft is usually a good product
i have another headstock tuner that ive had for awhile
the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return
its rugged and i like it
im sure it would be great on a dark stage
i sing fairly low and airy  works great for me
bag was ripped so i almost lost the screw and washer
bottom line  as a monitor look no further
it does seem like it can deal with some wear and tear
this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics
this replacement so far is hanging in there
as for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generoussized screws etc
i love these pick holders
ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years
thats when i went looking at the cry baby
also bought the 25 length and used them on an assignment recently
last forever and easy to hold onto
works well to keep finger prints off
solid four stars despite me personal opinion
it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand
the switches and dials may also fail over time
just restrung my 12 string
easy to install with patience easy to use
my voice sounds great with this thing
still seems to be good quality
will i continue using the product
these are the only locks ill use now
just thought i let you know about that one
unfortunately thats about all it does
much less surface of the string touching
in this set i especially like the 4th string at
the guys prove that the hype was legit
of course that could just be my expectations
thats part of the fun of tubebased od
the foam is obviously of good quality and its plenty thick
i could carry on forever but you get the idea
both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head
i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness
i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass
been golding up an 88 strat plus that has seen better days
it proudly states the guitars origin of corona
the lines for the strings and frets are very close together
the exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending
not my pick at 150
sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that fatal blow
big mistake it deadened the sound terrible
would i buy this yes if i didnt try anything else first
the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar
square pad allows placement right next to the fret
whats not to like here
this is a great little uke for the money
your really cant beat them
it plays beautifully with my 100w amp
i bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap
not at all what i expected for the money
the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfect
sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here
it holds about 6 to 7 picks
its light dont know if it would handle major abuse but wow
my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand
so i picked these up
works great for my acoustic dreadnought
great match for your bedroom amp
a best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians
we are just playing for the love of it
my guitar is safe now with this hard case
it is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship but not stellar
for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere
id say definitely do not get this if youre a tech or gear head
other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this
dont judge their products on price alone
it cannot be denied that the boss dd7 is a versatile effective product
shipping took far too long
divas will not use the red ball windscreen
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo
they ring so bright and beautiful
this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size
the real jewel in the crown tho is the instruction book
great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics
a must have for any guitar player
they feel great sound great and are extremely cheap
but recently my life changed a little bit
plus its easy to see
i recommend this multiplug to everyone
if not just invest about 6 into an adapter like i did
they work perfectly and havent failed me once
hosa cable gtr210 guitar instrument cable  10ft
this pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a blueridge br160
nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq
best price with free shipping
it comes in different colors also
it is portable so i always have it with me
it was wellconstructed with all the connecting points working precisely and securely
so am i complaining about these limitations
this is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus but distinctly noticeable regardless
looks great on the guitar and works really well
the ones i got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture
these just happen to be my favorite
it works for what i use it for
tried this and was not happy
i leave the choice of that to you the reader
this one says specifically for a ukulele
you have to take the pedal off to access the battery
it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced
my songleaders have tested it and guess what
what more could you ask for
also it cant be beat for when youre just jamming alone at home
weird suggestion   hang on to the box it comes in
however now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome
leds make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range
i see mixed reviews here
this is a great bargain too since its certainly not an expensive accessory
hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling
but dont get me wrong its still pretty strong
ive 34first act34 brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed
ill look silly if it lets me stay in tune
these things work really great
they really do help with speed and accuracy
the guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible and that means
its well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to
just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic
then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over
very pleased with this purchase
the ocd gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone
i love metal rock classic rock etc
inspires my ears to make music
this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board
these strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers
its quite hard on your collarbone
overall i like it and its certainly worth the minimal price
just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen
unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop
its almost odish in its responsiveness
less than one star for this piece of
i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure
to all heavy music guitarist i highly recommend this one
does its job just fine
product is as described and fits mic perfect
yep i said it better than a tubescreamer
soft touch easy care  cant beat it
good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china
true bypass means no tone suck to boot
great price and should last long enough
super simple to install and very sturdy once installed
im really happy with my new picks
ive had one of these for about 2 years now
i must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too
i have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way
it works better than my piano
but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy
id recommend it to anyone
solid tuner more accurate than i anticipated and very easy to use
this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument
if youre shopping for a tuner give this a try
i researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit
hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though
this brush is sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest and thorens
for solos itll boost your mids and your signal
as i said this is small but really not a toy
so in light of the competition the focusrite looks kind of ok
this pop filter is great
i love this thing and for the price you just cant beat it
check your guitars sound hole diameter before ordering
but after 1 song you have to tune it again
no matter for me since all i use is the tuner anyway
for those wondering about latency obviously theres some
for the price this is a wonderful strap
that is where an amplifier comes in handy
they feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard
it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine
i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones
this pick is well designed for mandolin playing
the distortion it gives is good
what more could you ask of strat knobs
we have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive
several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound
when you turn it back on it usally works fine
you cant go wrong with the ts808
4 the case is made of metal
i guess this is typical for distortion boxes
this is not just a tuner  its a peacekeeper for our band
when you need an audio insert cable you need an audio insert cable
i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a 6 practice cable
you cant beat the price for these quality guitar strings
it has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance
these are the thickest picks ive ever used
worth the money for certain
what the more expensive model has going for it is looks
do take note that this stand has a us standard 58 top
overall i am very pleased and saved time on string changes
hows that for an endorsement
found the guardian at amazon and thought for 10 how could i go wrong
great deal for the very low price
i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics
the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance
but i did buy this for rock band
i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system
it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport
dont ask me how it works but it does
over all a nice product
i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days
no dropping guitars around here
it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly
its solid and works great very adjustable
it holds all my acoustics perfectly
so far this has been the most impressive of the options offered
much better than trying to rolloff the volume
some say that the grip is good
a pick that stays in hand
its going back to the store where i purchased it
small enought to fit on top of a table or under it
i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti
i would buy this again or recommend to anyone
its especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming
this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there
nice hardware on this case
and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports
it changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar
amazoncom did a great job too getting this out to me
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need
hardly any breaks considering i get the thin ones
most of the popular options or 100 and up
i changing my review from just okay to contextually perfect
i didnt believe it myself
i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry
its built to last and solid as a rock
i dont and they arent for me
i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly
and nothing happened to it or the guitar
very much worth the cost and i thank amazon for having them
i read the reviews of the few similar options
this thing uses tiny smc components in the circuitry and therefore isnt really moddable
be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order
whats not to like here
ive used a variety of tuners
this power supply is great for me
throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials
coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years
i thought that if its made by hohner it must be fairly good
the medium was the hardest out of the bunch
you can set the height always considering that your guitars dont reach the floor
i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus
i figured i had nothing to lose
i switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable
when using the mxl 24 usb in win 7 no driver download is necessary
they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job
i have heard that some are too long for it
i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button
on stage i prefer microphone boom holders
so it will work the same with both
use them on all makes and no complaints todate
originally i purchased a behringer eq700 equalizer pedal for my rig
chances are its in working order no matter what
its really flexible on how youre planning to put on top of it
no reason i cant make something like that on my own though
every guitar player should own this tool
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board
the best 29 that ive spent in a long time
they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding
unbeatable for acoustic especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy
because you like the tone they provide
i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself
this little box is great for metronome use
it doesnt sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest
exceeded my expectations on quality and price
highly recommend to everyone looking for a case
my neighbors im sure are not pleased
the princeton amp emulation is sweet
have been very happy with them
to keep your guitar looking and sounding great
i still need to read a lot of the users manual
it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room
i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele
the strap ends are great but theyre not really secure
no tone loss at all
one of those duh things i didnt even think of until just now
totally happy with service and product
shines up guitars very nice
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great
i use the fender for electric and the behringer for the acoustic for practicing
im not an overdrive player
the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very wellmade
this is a sturdy case that looks good too
compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal
if you need a longer cable buy a longer cable
it is want i need for travel
havent found any others that sound and feel so good
this stand is made of quality products
just ordered a shorter stand
i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently
you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase
theres not enough throughput in usb 11
the switch is easy to use
nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick but its not for me
other things worth mentioning its not as heavy as my vox all tube amp
easy enough as i completed this is one minute
it will survive a nuclear blast
theyre better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers
and another comment in 2013
much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning
im a huge fan of elixirs
not a good start though
for the price they can not be beat
this music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units
the rubber housing is an excellent idea
the gel in the name sounded intriguing
either way once plugged in it sounds great
just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq
it is not going to come off because its that good
good value and good function
very durable and not uncomfortable either
if you want a tuning challenge the low bass e string is it
the metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions eighth notes sixteenthsetc
my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size
it is of average quality but for the price i wasnt expecting much
jj seems to have a smoother sound than most
a well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product
the color is sort of a metallic red almost candy apple red
notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc
this is my first fender amp and probably not my last
stays in tune very well
very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out
it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily
the 300  350 are cheap and they work
the sound from the 65 speaker requires some space to develop
these drops are not just a convenience
but i will never do that and neither will you
they worked fine at a great price
ha amazon rejected my first review because i mentioned a competitor by name chickens
i would buy this again
this cable works fine for my needs right now
although i ordered three of them
i have 4 classical guitars 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string
with no additional outboard gear if i didnt want
the last string winder you will ever buy
every one is superbexcept for this phase 90 the nonscript version reviewed here
i have 4 of them
easy to hang onto when strumming
this pedal gets me there on the cheap
if you use ext mic
the tascam dp008ex is great
have to reorder soon  great strings for the money
delay and chorus are also pretty good
however i have loaded the software on my laptop
works like its supposed to
long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod
so far very reliable after a few months of use
the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping
had mine for 2 years now and no complaints still as good as new
id buy another in a heart beat
i have used this winder now 4 times
not bla bla bla this joyo pedals are the best any you get
it is solid but light weight enought to move as needed
even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end
second it fits great  does exactly what its supposed to do
it is a decent cable
overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone
i swear by these strings
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
the pickups are really nice
easy to play and they sound great
if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you wont be disappointed
the improvement in tone is in all the right places
buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones
i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isnt my thing
until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane  aha
i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot
it is actually a good little practice amp
these picks are sturdy and wont break that easily
another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor
if had to do over again id pass
construction seems to be pretty good
great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too
i rub the entire neck down before and after i play
to conclude would i recommend these
this stand is great for my 45lb peavey 1500
love the price and they shipped quickly
the g and the d were fine
it is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly
maybe its better under mac
it included a multiplug cable but not a right angle one
also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides
other than that a wonderful system
makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again
unbelievable instrument a pleasure play
but not that big a deal
its a good product just what i expected
a bit too thick for me
has a black finish on it
im still waiting on the return for this
all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for
this pedal really hits the spot
ive used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar
that increases their resale value so the tool pays for itself
you will pay up to 4x more for similar stands
also picks up noise from your movements
i recommend it as a well functioning stand at a very economical price
the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect
the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set
using my dremel tool i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit
i took a look at it and knew i had to have one too
these daddario  strings are great
easy to mount rack components
believe it or not ive been putting off buying one
only thing is that it is big
comes with a capacitor so thats a bonus
great stereo sound out of the keyboards
the price is also right and i recommend
i have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud
often cheap cords die within a year or so
i think its worth a hundred dollars
simple to use compact and well built
great tuner for my guitar class
i bought this for my son so he could record with it
i hate them as a rule
i have finally discovered that the 34perfect set34 is a moving target
the body is very solid beautiful finish mine is a sunburst color
mykyser capoworks on it just fine
i use them all winter long in my guitars
i decided to trythe dunlop formula 65 polish  cleaner
this a great instrument cable
the picks feel great and im having a good time
all in all if you need a budget system at home  get this
this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musicians gear stand
they are all awesome in thier own way
fit my 07 mim strat perfectly
spot on tuning  very bright display and super fast and easy to use
almost the same sound as the pyramids and a lot cheaper
in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight
ill be honest here  i bought this one primarily because of its looks
but i enjoyed listening to it while playing
sorry folks but id skip this one
almost compares to a monster cable
id buy this product again if i had it to do over again
it has worked great now for over a year at least
i first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks
the girls will love you and the boys too
this is a 000  om acoustic
if you want to spice up your board go for some color
i just hope it works in the field as well
ive heard that the adhesive doesnt work on rubber wood etc
the steel as expected has more of brighter twang
theres no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing
update  too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also
definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised
i definately helps cut down 34wind whistle34 on my mic
also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings
sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars
i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels
its also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db1w1m
it has held up with all the kids using it
lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy
when it comes to the low end these are lacking
not too heavy and very handy for traveling
dava 6024 grip tipitem is as advertised
im quite pleased with this speaker
ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life
for sure a good buy
i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks
i am disappointed in this thing
high value for low  risk
only thing i miss a bit is a headphone jack
this tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly
it is more than i hoped for
so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone
i bought these for my music class
the padding is also excellent and comfortable
this came in the mail today in a rather large box
another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic
says so right in the manual
i had it close but its the fine tuning that really helps
the max grips have a much better grip
dont know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat
good   plenty of gain on hand
this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund
it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved
even if this one doesnt last ill keep buying more
id recommend these to someone trying to save some money
small lightweight and very easy to use dose the job well
all in all a good deal
i really like the h4ns design the menus and controls are nicely organized
definitely would purchase again solid quality build
i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner
easy to use and economical product
zt should not have sold this for 450 in the first place
the snark i chose has been working just great for me
good idea to keep more than one of these around
for me the mic has been all its cracked up to be
this is mainly a matter of personal preference
sent it back after one day
great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks
the pins measure  28mm or 1 14 inches in length
i dont like the soft opening
fresh strings do sound better
but trust me this thing is really good
stays in place and works as de
you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff
easily the best quality capo for its price
no more issues with ground loops or other problems
that is all the volume i need for practicing in my home
it acts like a vice in a woodshop project
the lowend on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm
please take a note of that
95 of the time this will take care of the problem
bought this to use on my 1962 strat reissue
i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day
the seem to be all the same company
i like these well enough that i have four of them
im sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well
it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at hp level
this mic is built like a tank yes as others have said
gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings
good quality seem durable enough
it just might not be your sound
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
good strings for the price nice ring to them
youre more apt to grab your axe and play more
finally a product that is as simple to use as a pointandshoot camera
would need a heavier base for use with a boom
this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it
the possibilities are limited only to your imagination
when fully extended the arm cant hold the entire weight of the shockmountyeti microphone
that is an easy fix
this is not a lightweight stand
if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets
my ukulele has a better tone with these strings
its a mainstay on my pedal board now
using it as a back up stage mic
dunlop also makes quality picks and i have yet to break one of these
purchased this to replace a behringer pedal because the behringer introduced a swishing sound
but once on it is great
i got the gold and its goodlooking without being garish
this is a very good investment
my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it
our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack
one certain advantage of the sm58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability
the natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrified
additionally mine came very well setup from the seller aside from the inevitable tuning
its very lightweight and with its optional plug and onoff switch is versatile enough
with the lighter varieties that would be far from true
theres a few schools of thought on studio monitors
fender medium my favorite guitar pick a dozen should last a while right
im changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star
otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
nice big lugs to solder to
ive used these strings for quite a while now
otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger
recording from the internal mics seems to work fine
it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat
it does the job well
this eq achieves almost the same results and i paid less
i need to resolder the ends after a concert though
this capo does exactly what it should
this is a great place to begin
its one of the best purchases ive made in a long time
i guess i have tried about every type of pick around
i got this for christmas and would shop around a lot more
i have the older version of this as well this newer one
you just have to try them and see
other than that great strings
weve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo
recently ive been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the
but all i bought it for was the purpose of tuning mission accomplished
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic
i would recommend this product
this is the only guitar ive used them on but they sound great
the strap would constantly fall off
so i and many others play nickel
there is no doubt about it national fingerpicks are pretty much the standard
great grip slow wearing and they dont break
got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either
i just prefer analog all the way around
just give some days to tuners to get used to
the fingers in front hold the instrument in
its also very good looking
used to tune with a tuning fork
still a tight fit though since theres only 834 of wire
i really should get a case
i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing
too soon to tell if the sn8 will hang in there
it is heavy and small what gave us attack
this unit is very small and tucks away nicely
stick tape holds it anywhere you want it
90 gauge at guitar center and love them
was a clear mike but i didnt detect any body to the sound
this string set offers typical daddario quality and value
no big deal just more parts and weight
bought verbzilla digitech rv7 and the verbzillas ripoff   behringer rv600
those flimsy backless music stands are worthless imo especially on a breezy evening
like i said its a great gig bag
its kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because its stiff
the handle extreamly soft to the touch
it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price
it fits the guitar perfect and is easy to adjust
on tune and back to playing
the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar
the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked
not from music123 it doesnt
ive paid a lot more for a lot less
it is reliable and rock solid
i added two stars to the product
i began reading online about muffled audio on windows 7 pcs
but based on my experience i dont recommend this one
problaly exist betters pedals but its produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything
well it fits but just barely
hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for
this works well with the mandolin
it also seem tightly put together at the ends
sound in my opinion needs some tweaking
for the price paid is a very reasonable option
very quick reaction to string
a dull inept version of a tubescreamer
it tunes the harp fairly well
overall it is a bargain for the price
he would not send a warranty replacement
it will clip on anything you want to hold it
i really like the deluxe bags by fender
neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply
of course it doesnt stay long because it tunes fast
you have to get this pedal
in the past its always been a crapshoot regardless of brand or reputation
once locked theyre not going anywhere
very good quality cable and plugs
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design
it has a cool name but thats about it
my capos include bird of paridise paige and kyser
its easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops
not by any means actually
all in all a super amp
this is a tough unit easy to set and locks tight
it will pick up ambient noise from the front but thats to be expected
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point
bought 6 to replace to older models i had on stage
for the price and quality this kyser capo works on a uke
that is my only complaint
so here it the continuum
it sounds good and looks really nice
this thing is incredibly cool
simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually
i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also
but the dunlop is better to me
the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine
its just more accessible on the desk
ive spent time and money way more than 1000 free advice
this is a very wellbuilt stand
i definitely feel relieved to have them off
instead it produces a warm oldtime overdriven tone
the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use
makes my voice sound fantastic
not good if you were using it in a performance
it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range
i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay
i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
and at a great price to boot
they made my cv50s sound fuller with greater sustain
but for less than 100 nice doesnt even describe it
ive been using this for years
there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector
paradoxical i know but thats where the magic of this strap is
any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can
pros  size size and size
i replaced it with  mini modtone type delay
behringers tm300 is made from tough plastic
it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality
it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it
this was a terrific deal
so if you do get a bum string give them a holler
the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer
i have to admit that this is true
looks like planet waves hit the mark once more
the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone
this has saved my bass drum head from many holes
the sn1 senses frequency through vibration
after testing each of the tripod stands
i use this pedal in my pedal chain
what works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another
the storage compartment is nice and large
so i figured an experiment was in order
i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget
adjusting the height and tilt is difficult
not much to say here
the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss
i was totally surprised that it actually works this good
i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem
ive owned several multieffect pedals in the past even one digitech
all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders
this is what im talking about  cheap but very usual form behringer
save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand
the bulkiness of this cabledoesnt seem to lend itself to easy coiling
i wouldnt buy another one
daddario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around
by the way these are listed as
this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices
a combination of metal and plastic
so for now im good but in a few weeks ill need new strings
i will always have one of these on my board
at least i dont want to
this ampwas a wonderful deal at 300 when i originally bought it in 2011
i like fender mediums because i use them on both bass and guitar
fits the instrument and old mexican acoustic and feels comfortable
makes tunning easy and fast
im not a fan of shaped les paul cases
but that is honestly to be expected
the volume control is obvious
bonus its an active device so it can boost the signal
i installed this in a super champ x2
this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described
this makes sliding on the bass real smooth
at 12 per shot who cares
it works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror
now i dont know why
no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min
we keep a can in every case
but its just not for me
i bought these to go from my board to the amp
so not really a con
recently acquired an ovation mandolin which itself is hardly 34standard34 in appearance materials etc
its eco friendly and nicely packaged
i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality
i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii
its all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn
the strap i got was a levys with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable
it has more flexability than just a tone knob
i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube
i mainly use it in 4 channel mode
flash forward  this thing kills
over all i would not recommend this product
600l is the exact same string gauges
the travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself
wanted it just on looks alone
this pedal is absolutely remarkable
rugged pedal by a little known company
this is the best cleaning product ive ever used
no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing
crank this baby up and it moves air
all that said it is nice and some will love it
with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp
no issues and pretty sure i will never have any
i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone
unlike the bad monkey this doesnt have an additional mixer  cabinet emulated output
you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it
great for acoustic and electric
im getting a few more
the work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple
think lightning crashes by the band live
i used a rubber washer i had and that worked very well
form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed
i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds
i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks
ill keep using them just maybe in a different gauge
i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag
this is a lovely wall mount for your guitar
padded so does not scratch finish on neck
very strong in the set when worn
best 12string capo i have ever usedand thats over decades
the foam is good and the hardware is included
so its like that guy who asks for a lighter
kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use
these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently
it took at least 15 minutes to do that update
the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust
you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal
it does not fix your transmission
i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles
you want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal
good upgrade fender vintage springs
the price is a great selling point just by itself
works as well as locking strap buttons did for me
for some reason this one just doesnt hit the notes right
will but another one if any of them die great product
the elixir 8020 comes out on top
i hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase
so testing on their own mics
means only that dr 40
theres not much to be said about this pedal  it just works
i dont have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand
attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head
it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for
by now they work really good and no interference where detected
they are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable
its quick and pretty on the money
its easy to set up and easy to take down
then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick
mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective
an excellent value highly recommended
there is nothing worse than a bunch of outoftune loud guitar players
definitely the best amp in this
nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick
ill update this review ifwhen it breaks
com when i did and will not part with the amp
if its not the highest quality stop complaining
your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings
once again the controls are easy and direct
my first wah was a morley steve vai bad horsie
im a man on the move and am constantly away from home
rocks my world and back to the garden
got what i needed  a basic capo for a good price
i think ive found how lazy i am
if theyre used for live performances they will not last very long
distortion is more noticeable at higher volume
dunlop provided an inexpensive winder thats durable
one volume knob one tone and one distortion knob
i used to tune my guitar online
ive owned strats telecasters cheapies an alvarez i think
fret work is top notch
yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like seagulls
it fits beautifully and powers all of them at once
i was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size
i think i could write a book here
tonesound quality  the sound quality of this effect is outstanding
they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff
itd been about 6 years since ive had an electric guitar
smells nice and makes your guitar looking new
i had problems getting it to work on my imac
remember  because of the material you will notice a slight difference in sound
may be  the age thing
the light should go out
i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies
small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practicesrehearses etc
so i will probably be using it on my electrics
i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone
i wish it had at least one more inch
everything i have seems to be jet black
everything on it is very adjustable which i also like
the edge is now smooth and nice
this does not mean i will not try others
i cheap buy and it works excellent
bends and slides are smoother than ever
theyre gorgeous sounding especially when new
for a clipon you cant beat the accuracy this little unit gives you
you do need to hit only one string at a time however
nano is small but quite durable
i bought it for a silvertone sd10 which costs about 120
they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass
the sound is clear and crisp for its size
excellent sound quality and i would pin them against bose any day
it is a ratchet rather than a clamp
bought these to replace some gold ones on a les paul clone
overall a good buy for a backup strap or your primary
this music light has one drawback it doesnt have a master switch
if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it
hosa makes good stuff this is no exception
the one i received was completely useless
it goes with us when we travel with our guitars
anyways i buy it from amazon and the packaging is great
every one that ive used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly
does it give you more sustain
works and sounds really good
daddarios nyxl1046 nickel plated electric guitar strings i have the light are the best
i tried to tune it using a clampon snark tuner
all this and a secret compartment for picks
stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely
its a sound that many would like to acheive
this low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked
i said good not loud
heres what it is  an exceedingly wellconstucted amazingly playable guitar
i recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have
i got two of them
i would purchase these again for my needs
it has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister
the build quality seems questionable from mxr
i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day
if you havent ever experimented with capos try them out
no issues with the screw not tightening either
just put a good analog fuzz after it  youre good to go
seemingly no tone loss no added noise and no coloration
they also last a long time before they go dead
it feels reliable and without adding noise
it definitely doesnt add any more fatness
it works great on both very accurate and easy to use
when they say fits soundholes from 3375  35 they really mean it
super tight and easy to lower
didnt test microphones yet but i think this is best price for 7 microphones
i am a beginner guitar player
the design is solid well made and will go the distance
so i sent it back
this will make your fretboard smile
these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guidetree
excellent build and looks great
nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone
there are snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars
in my humble opinion the pictures make the product look purple
this one is harder to lose because of its size
all type of delays are sounds beatiful
these are currently the only cables i use on my pedalboard
perfect retrofit for my 1989 american strat
like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style
excellent quality and is very comfy
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips
this one is easy  buy it
there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i dont blame the device
then i thought this thing cant work very well but it does perfectly
this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date
very analog sounding not digital
yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people
a great move toward a new generation of capos
each band is hyper sensitive
this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way
i absolutely love these picks and swear by them
ive had absolutely no problems with it
but i love the way screen and mount look
zero issues with this cable so far
when i first felt this strap i smiled
it is similar to skb and fits my guitar very nicely
the price was  awesome
so whats then point of all this
connection is secure no worries about uneven connections it also detaches without a hitch
i wish its built with switch onoffrecomend to buyer
im sorry but thats just idiocy in action
it gives wonderful string balance and sustain
i have had 34swing trees34 for many guitars for years
on the cannon the lever was vertical
i used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets
i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years
analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic
it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size
so i ordered another one
its got an attitude but it soft at the same time
i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments
its pretty without distracting from the guitar itself
good bargain though for 699
and this is my favorite victim
hard to describe but if youre used to playing nickle youll notice the difference
for under thirty clams i can look past these things
so it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for
bought it to replace strings for my taylor
theyre especially wonderful because theyre battery operated
i got these for my electric and the ej2610p acoustic electric for my acoustic
these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them
and drive another speaker cabinet which bugera also makes
i go through these quite a bot but for 2030 you cant go wrong
this tuner works by guitar vibration
tone is good as is durability
either way i am happy with them
would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
ive had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos
i was surprised howsturdy it appears
there was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke
im surprised i havent broken it yet
i have bone on all of my guitars
giving these 3 stars is being generous
i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp
have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state
the 10s are my choice for rock and blues
the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable
great price from the seller as well
do they sound as good as a 5k gibson f5
all 5 star reviews on this baby
it works well and seems to be durable
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment
this mic is absolutely awesome
i did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference
you receive 3 felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick
good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups
decent cables and arent too expensive
or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it
the other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built
the feel a little more stiff my usual
and this thing is loud
the sixinline enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping
that being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway
i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work
this is one of the cleanest sounding miniamps youll find
was easy to adjust and is very stable
if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed
sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables
very nice case for the price
the stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things
this was for a friend who needed a guitar capo
i like the length too
i prefer woven cables for looks
and the result sounds really right
it appears to be indestructible
i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out
i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment
one customer said it did but mine did not
pair this up with a pedaltrain board and youve got yourself a sweet setup
you might end up with 6 like meor morein no time
this is a perfect addition to any serious rig
plus its on sale right now so snatch one before theyre all gone
have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon
none of the problems onoff that plague the cry baby
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric736 lbs
thats my experience at least
why do you have to be so difficult
one of these should come standard issue with every guitar
thing is great for multipedal use
i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine
i think tortex  delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by
its also lighter than the others mentioned which is a plus for traveling musicians
the quality is always the same
to the people complaining about it falling over
this also helps those of us using electric guitars that dont have extrawound humbuckers
this should be your first pedal
this was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions
ive tried many others but always come back to ernie balls
th only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere
i use this with my mobile dj equipment and it is fantastic
but i will order more
comes with a 14 inch adapter which is nice
i dont know why others rated it as a 4 star
i wouldnt recommend these to anyone
i was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own
generously ill give it 2stars
i use it at practice and during our live shows
and yes this pedal will do that
i bought this on a whim
this pedal is very nice
honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing
i really like the soft flexible cable these have
well i didnt expect much due to the price
the learning curve is moderate
i use this clamped to a table and its a superb product
it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation
can be done but not as good
for the price you cant go wrong
but make sure there are return privileges
mod switch adds a perfect 34chorus34 effect for 80s metal ballads sound
exactly what i needed for testing guitars and playing at home
this review is my honest opinion
that wasnt really my goal
anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad
also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over
i will try the sn8 shortly and give this one to a friend
what else can you ask for
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster
i know thats bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming
this is what fender calls blaceface clean
after a week im already playing songs and im not a string player
i have finally learned my lesson
i will buy it again
you can just plug in your guitar or bass
the pm05 has more boom but less treble
i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead
suggestion   find a wall stud and use 3 screws for heavier instruments
this thing is simply beautiful
for me it was a good perchase
a buddy of mine got one and hes killing it on the bends
at 220 id have to love it to keep it
they are a wonderful product
it is well made and i would buy it again if needed
obviously not everyones head and neck are the same as mine
i get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack
i still pull one of these out every once in awhile
for what its worth i am a professional musician with perfect pitch
no odd muting or dropouts
only needed minor setup adjustments
unlike the clamp kind like the snark its hard to share
easy to put on and take off
nothing sounds as bright as these strings
if the answer is 34hell yes i deserve them all
my father is a fulltime gigging musician primarily on steel guitar and telecaster
the colors are nice as well
ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one
i bought a power supply never looked back
it has cushin padding so my guitar is safe  its small but stady
thanks to amazon for the quick service
i would highly recommend this pedal
its well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market
it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying
this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great
first real harmonica i have owned
the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 75
it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg
they are good quality and very durable
hello musicfriends  this is built cheap but sounds great
the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are
this is a great little item
nothing bad to say about this strap
i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action
focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this
regular on is basically like a standard lead channel
you just press the button and start plucking strings
this mic works better for some people than others
it took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions
i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too
its made by monster cable
looks good but disappointed that they arent made in the usa
this is my new favorite rock pick
a phaser is a very specific sound but i love it in small doses
this microphones quality is amazing
great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to
you do use them right
but first some details about the tuner
i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background
5 stars for this one
i figured it would go the same way as the threeway  wrong
i put these on all of my guitars
i hope its analog but theres nothing about it in the documentation
wish that it had a onoff switch but you can get around that
for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super 250s
it just does it all and well
but it is a complete kit
his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products
angled end is a good fit
i got this because of the price
its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound
no worries about using this with an expensive instrument
this is an absolutely amazing reverb pedal
over all  this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag
so its basically like adding another channel to my amp
theres enough reviews on here that state the obvious
point two  any form of gain will create a ton of hiss
that said i purchased this for my home recording studio
i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything
in that environment i thought it a nice instrument
a very nice addition to my collection
otherwise its well built and works
i use fender 150ls and with it the longevity doubles
i dont like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes
people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix
they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect
here are their key points  good quality construction
again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands
a google earth view of their addressed explained it all
i didnt use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs
slap and tap an dont forget ur strap
the price was very good
works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation
the promise is a 34bolder high end fuller low end34
the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there
this is a really nice thick strap
i have only 2 requirements for a tuner 1
i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere
to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling
cant go wrong with tortex
annoyance 2   this is a 20 watt amp right
convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside
im not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra
the first two are pretty heavy and bulky
i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean
this mxl is usbonly 4448 only
my first thought was now i have to learn how to play this thing
i only wish digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper
but thats a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument
this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off
fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue
its supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasnt tilted back or fallen over
it tunes without any problems
got a new tenor uke and couldnt resist putting my fav strings on it
pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily
im glad i bought it just wish it didnt come with the stains
im a real klutz with my cords
it came down to the ac15 fender blues jr and the ibanez ts15
lizzie wrote back and said shed take care of it
so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again
maybe i should get that for cheaper
in that case i would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier
i recommend this little amp wholeheartedly
i like a lot this pedal
i actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus
but this is a case of you get what you pay for
it holds up very well also
i received this yesterday in my order
this dunlop ergo pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar
its what they do and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal
i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great
when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection
attaching it is a snap
i shouldnt have to feel like this thing just barely fits me
still for sanitys sake id position the stand close to a wall
on vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you
obviously cardboard isnt going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths
4 stars is my tops anywhere
you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model
the distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy
i folds down to a very small size but is quite strong
the display is easy to read and easier to use
this combo is very rare
some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge
watch youtube to compare models
and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this 34leaning stuff
it even comes with a case with two zippered sections
the overdub layering is simply superb though its saved as mono
it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast
this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings
unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website
i love the sustained bright tone
danny gatton did so and i wouldnt have it any other way
even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well
matte flat black finish is nice
i removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit
thats exactly what i wanted from a desk stand
as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years
take 1015 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor
it does a fantastic job at that
this isnt the best power supply available
overall this is a really good bargain for an extra backup or kids mic
70 db would be better
i have lots of tuners and several brands of clip ons
but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal
the snark is great and the price is amazing
they seem bright yet still soft
i was concerned when i first open the package because of its size
the bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box
and if youre not careful it may find a permanent home
well padded and will not damage your instrument
i read many negative reviews on several sites
speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first
this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars
behringers mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price
i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour
really efficient way to go in my opinion
these are good quality cables at an economical price
this set is not for everyone
the tuning is accurate the lcd screen is clearly visible it works great
really simple little review here
they say 24 months ive never come close to even a month
lets have a go  im glad i did
it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps
it works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar
for me i like the heft of these cables
34you know your man is working hard
would like different holiday designs like this
having the pick pocket is a neat feature
initially the product didnt work
so many over the years i cant recall
a little noisy  but what do you expect at this price right
i recommend it to home studios also those who travel with recording gear
also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak
had them over two months a they work great
you cant get better than this
plus wow its a great price
most of them that ive owned you have to plug into your instrument
so now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works
i definitely would say this is a musthave
i wanted to like this
yes you can bend it
i have a set of the original locking tuners on a 84ish strat
ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings
does not fly off the head when playing
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg
no one hears themselves the way they sound to others
easy to see when positioned correctly
works right out of the box
the software is a little lame and doesnt always work properly
not so with this pedal
ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment
works great with my fender super camp x2
they stay on in their cases
you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc
but what do i know
or just buy a better guitar to begin with
i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp until now
it runs fine on batteries also
dont buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca
quite pleased with this little mixerpreamp
these are the only strings i will use on my les paul
more importantly the sound doesnt deteriorate with higher volumes
inexpensive solution and quite handy
i liked the string spacing on these nuts
unfortunately the top end isnt as defined as a at2035 or nt1a
i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed
fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks
it works well hasnt broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned
unfortunately i think the roadrunner is better quality thicker material
this pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds  and is very versatile
ill never buy this brand again
its really really an amazing program
im quite happy with it
but when i grabbed this pedal i was blown away
put a battery in and plugged it in
not a lot of bass
not sure how well it holds a tenor since i dont have one
grip is good and the thickness is just right for me
great as a booster as others have said
in fact i have already bought them several times
first i was fortunate enough to buy one for 300
this is a very good and stable stand
what im getting at is you get what you pay for
plus the battery life is great
no more to be written joy o the american dream
they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome
i tried other strings but i always come back to elixir
i have several of them and they have all performed well
even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well
i wish i would have thought of these
this is very accurate and also very easy to use
it also has a 14 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well
if you cant afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul
when they say small they mean small
those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion
90 is very inexpensive for a guitar
i have always had trouble holding onto picks
it was in two words masterfully made
it actually delivers much more sound than i expected
i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband
i use them for playing bass
works for a cheap bridge on my cheap stratocaster knockoff
i also really like the daddario pures
both of my snarks have broken off at this joint
the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great
pros  works really well and is easy to use
the leather is tough and will last for years
behringer has done it again
sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me
for the price this works really well
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
this polish works well for what i need it for
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget
i bought new strings but havent replaced them yet
this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value
one star short of a 5 star review
ghs allows me to minimize that
it fit perfect and gives the fender name to a saga kit guitar
this is what gives them their charm and voice
it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter
well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo
the thing is quick and accurate
never using another tuner again in my life
nothing special but the price isnt out of the world either
the strings last a long time in my opinion
performing nicely with a stock mim strat
these speakers worked great for 14 months
long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate
it may just have been the one i got though
i bought one about 4 months ago and just ordered a second
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
with that baby cranked i spent many happy hours in tone heaven
response and visual display are awesome
its sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works
liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads
the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable
i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites
i will be working on this
the supplier refunded some of the postage
here are a couple of more casual notes 1
like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele
we just need to be open to it
for the price its amazing
this stand is worth 1000 tops
this is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments
there is definitely a lot of clarity here
this is an awesome capo
update  january 7 2013
didnt look tapered to me and i cant use it
that low cost is obvious
so just make sure you get the right one
i have only had to replace the battery once
but it sounds great to me
i mean very loud radio background and i couldnt get ride of it
and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us 100 worked
some electric bassists still do this
the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling
sounds all right to me bright and well balanced sound
it also looks very nice
all the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid
i am going to an a pickguard to this one
these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords
for an 8 item you cant go wrong
something like this really should last at least a year or more
the hohner special 20 just seems to have this little extra
very close to the sound of an sm58
also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more
i tried this about 3 months ago
i will be buying more for all my guitar cases
i have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy
the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before
fender has done an amazing job with this amp
very responsive very clean sounding
the price is not too bad
absolutely tickled with the look and performance
pro co rat2   great dirty distortion pedal
the face pivots around and the display is nice and bright
this is the second one i have and it works well
i would really recommend not going to a retailer
i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest
also has no affect on sound of bass drum
the only reason i need to buy more  i lose them
it is possible that this capo may become my favorite
other than that its great
the user dials in the frequency sweep they want
let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide
i use all types and all brands and fenders are always predictably great quality
i have used many clipon guitar tuners
you can barely tell its there from the front
when my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced
you can tweak the echo in 100s of different ways
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
hey now youre eric clapton
believe this 5 feet cable is no small thing
amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience
i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound
i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming
they play great have nice action and tone
and compares well with other very high quality gear
basically this is a niche tuner
not so pleased with the sound quality
now stop reading this review and buy this capo
if anything i try to err on the side of low
this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives
update december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider
thats a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses
not much else to say
when it dies i will buy another one
i bought this because someone told me they really liked it
it would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons
i love the picks the tin they come in and the ease of use
i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument
im using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick
the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker
buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldnt have any worries
its a wah and wah and does just that
my go to capo for years
the oval shape is perfect
it did what i wanted  then some
the plugs are the standard screwdown type with well soldered  joints
i will get another for my monitor
but for practicing in your bedroom or similar its perfect
this was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and tone
you can still monitor your playing using the ipads headphone jack separately obviously
tests multiple types of cords also
as of 0313 the plastic seems pretty thickdurable
users of mxr carbon copy swear by them
tap function also helps a lot
the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly
i bought 5 of them from amazon because they were such a good price
again nothing that cant be fixed with other effects
gotta keep it simple on this review because its a simple item
it helped some but didnt get rid of the noise entirely
i would definitely recommend but its kind of expensive for what it is
so give them a try
but daddario pbs are a great place to start
the mistake i made was buying them hastily
pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue
the amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings fuzz twang etc
on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for 360 to 380
i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects
great product ive use them before and have always thought they were top quality
hasnt had any problems with it
this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings
i could not be happier
the streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical
just thought i would point that out
like the capo and metronome feature
its a great pedal period
the max grip just is very difficult to drop effortless to hold on to
you dont need to spend big money for tubes
but when i turn pro ill get something better
yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference
i prefer the warmer tone
that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book
for the price its good
for the most part this is a well builtdurable gig bag
but dont let that deter you
solid and super easy to use
the string cutter works like a champ
i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more
ill add it back to my own collection and upgrade the electronics
i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c1s
works very well in this capacity
excellent fine manufacturing good finish
we recorded in 4ch mode with two extra mics
truly an amazing little gadget
the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound
even the crunch button is just a louder sound
reverb sounds great as well
lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal
high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes
my buddy likes the case so i am happy
the taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should
this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played
i couldnt get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal
if you have issues with the driver definitely update
thats what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses
i would buy this product again
hey  stop reading this and order it
i bought this stand after trying two others that didnt work well
very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price
bought these for my squire strat
months into using the gig bag and not a single problem
so much so i may send it back
the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out
i like this a lot
this capo also has a pick holder
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them
right out of the box
these are stiff thick and heavy
it flashed a locked tempo but i really dont need that feature
that makes what seems like a lot 60 slots get filled up pretty fast
tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely its pretty sensitive
good length but very slippery
i wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well
goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now theyve updated its look
i purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar
i dont know how long it will last
this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string
are they as good as dedicated 100 per stomp box effects
very nice protection for my luna
no problems with distortion or noise
make sure your mic holder fits
but it sounds great with a tube amp
this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard
automatic  shutoff helps too
it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat
these are three times as high at guitar center
it works well so far on all my ukuleles
wipe each string when done and they will last longer
this is a great guitar case and a great price
thanks d8217addario for providing an awesome product
my old mic just wasnt cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface
just arrived in good shape
the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these
you will have to adjust your strap from the other side
i also dont care for the color coded rings on the strings
it rejects whats behind and to the side but in front its pretty sensitive
the master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular
use for small music gigs and djmc uses
all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts
would i get another one
i saw some hybrids on amazon and had never heard of them
i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal
the price is right and the size is right
everything is so quiet with no hum
it is smaller than i thought it would be
there are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers
i can put 6 7 picks on it
this capo works very well
thanks guys will be shopping with you again
the price was right from amz
they also have a nice full sound and are holding up well
it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously
this is a fun and very good guitar for the money
this is an excellent alternative to using it as a usb device
i bought mine used three years ago and it works great
highly recommended for acoustic guitar players
get it if you need one
this powergrip pedalboard mounting tape is velcro on steroids
this is super warm and can get very trippy
its my own fault for not looking at the specifications
just trying to decide what speakers to purchase
i have to wiggle and hold to get signal
its a really good deal at the price
they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in
best thing ive bought for my ipad in a while
i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick
they work fine for me
i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good
well surprise surprise surprise it didnt feedback and it sounds great
this mixer has four mic inputs
and this is the best price ive found
ive been using these strings for many years
it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy
i use it and my granddaughter uses it as well
if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner
sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time
everything works exactly as planned
how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable
and most are planet waves already
i use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesnt fall
it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do
it has its own level btw
i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks
they sound clear and bright and they last a good while
i write and record my own music
the only reason this is not a 5star review is because of the drings
if youre looking for some ridiculous review this wont be one
when i put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly
this board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply
jams and festivals bluegrass folk whatever became seas of intellitouch tuners
i will buy some more of these
the quality of construction is absolutely superb
this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified
these types of pedals are toys
line 6 has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week
humidity  not a problem with this stuff
these are by far my favorite picks
ill never buy their strings again
but then i remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and i thought okay
i just appreciate a great value and daddario strings are just that
ive tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer
cons  none to speak of
easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connecthold very solid
to be clear  i am quite the newbie guitar player
just got it so far so good
i also perform live in a cover band
it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either
im a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher
this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording
this strings have good sound and hold a tune well
for under twenty dollars pylepro cant be beat
i do wish it could rotate both directions
i have several of them and use them often on many guitars
this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars
the overall quality seems good and i have had no problems
the more  you spend the better
it holds tune and has not failed yet
incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it
it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset
i recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb
i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good
i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is
it is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise
how did you test it
you cant beat the price
anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic
im glad i bought this
so this is some good stuff
the mat protects the guitar body
this pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless
very light very sturdy and at a low price
this pickup is actually a really great product for what it is
steel strings only  does not apply to nylon or gut strings
i will definitely pick up more for my other axes
because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary
great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great
i would recommend it to those who can afford it
i believe these are nicer than the epis
a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceage sounding
i use these on my acoustic washburn and they stay bright for weeks
it wasnt supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look
well see how long it lasts
some strings sound dull right out of the package
by some sort of mixup i got nanowebs by mistake
this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect
the blue power light is blinding
havent had to change tuning once they settled in
i also ordered dava 6024 grip tip guitar picks they are nice
definitely worth the reasonable cost
smooth but not dull sounding
and it looks very professional
sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string but generally works great
id guess they have about 100 years of wear on them
as far as the sn8 is concerned
the basic stuff on the bullet is very good
the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it
it comes apart quite easily
i am very pleased with this purchase
i am editing my earlier review
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic
added mass easier to tune
this pedal has flawless colorless sound quality
as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach
i use this little guy in connection with my daw and digital piano
i like them i dont love them
i kept the switch because of the quality
the gold plating ensures a solid connection
im rapidly becoming a behringer fan
happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to
i got two of them
felt just like the day it arrived from the factory
this seems like a nice high quality cable
highly recommended for the occasional strummer
they are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet
everything rolled into one product
second these are musical instruments
the other ones must be for some special type of music
very durable and gets the job done
it is a great option if not simply the best
for the price they are worth it
the drum presets are fun to use
its small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk
my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made
that being said this has been the best interface ive ever owned
teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
its easy to uphook one and hook the other
that doesnt make this valueless
they look good as well and they are easily adjustable
a real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses
mostlly notnecessary for me but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too
daddario make the best strings out there
a good variety of different picks
remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp
great value  highly recommended
it has a ball joint construction
i bought this for my son to clean his guitar with
i feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks
this does just what it says it does
very affordable and good quality
i guess i thought being felt they wouldnt be so stiff
it has a remote to control it
if youre looking for a creamy true bypass analog pedal then look no further
great case for small cash
i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from
this string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body
if youre in need of a side boom look no further
theres a slight hiss too
it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books
the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease
that aside these will greatly improve the way any set sounds
got this for my electric guitar
i just loaded the whole prerecorded track into a slot
what you would come to expect from lanikai
nice solid construction and vibration mount included
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic
one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings
they are certainly worth the price
they are not too stiff nor are they too soft
if youre thinking aout buying this guitar dont
this mic stand is a great value
the planet waves pwct12 is my new favorite
we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system
for me this pedal gets you 80 of the way there
i got it today in the mail and i already tried it
i was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked
i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one
they do work and theyre effective but they are too pronounced
one issue is that this is not a plugandplay device
i hate changing strings without one anymore
it is hours and hours of fun
i purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter
not much of noise and practical carry
i have always loved line 6
for one thing theyre pretty stiff
in those 7 years i havent broke a single string
try a set and see what i mean
thankfully i still have most of these picks
plastic attachment clutch and extremely thin gauge metal
they do make noise kind of like an old album
it came in perfect condition
for 100 usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for
i have one for each guitar and just leave them on
i think i paid around 495 for most of the ones i purchased
these arent diamonds or gretsch but theyre fantastic
holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get
on no setting could i get rid of
isnt that what its all about
never thought itd be my goto pedal
anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one
otherwise a wonderful product at a great price
it will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking
it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously
now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter
i was sure glad that i ordered this cable as a backup
i am not an expert on guitar strings
these dunlop straploks are amazing
get something better that doesnt twist up an ravel into knots
straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need
the negatives and why i cant recommend it are as follows
not as much padding as i would like
sustain is very good as a result
im not going to recommend this over the 15 capos
everything i wanted and more
ive got a mxr mc404 cae for my concert line pedals
order it now while the price is this low
its a very cute little capo
great sound and stays in tune
excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player
i just got mine today and tried it out
it gets crackling knobs going again
they seem to be made well made
if that time comes im sure this will be a great tube
mine seems to be fine doesnt look or feel flimsy at all
there was no greaselubricant qualities
since the string is nylon i gave it a chance to settle
very sturdy and very well made
give it high marks for form and function
i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews
its very light and thin sounding
these tuners are just awesome
wide overdrive and tone range
it has some other advanced features but i havent need them
this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles
just clear as a bell
since the headset has a monomicrophone this adapter works great
the pedal is quiet and solidly built
i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic
though  i like the kyser the planet waves triaction is super slick
the materials feel high quality
you can compare both at guitar center
it really has its own thing going on
it is a good fit for the soprano uke
i wish this stuff had been around when i first started playing
i say this one just may be a keeper
you should check out the 78 badasss distortion from mxr too
this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does its job
i read the description but it did not say cheap
i also tried high and low but set it back to middle
the couple more that came in had a wider slot on them
it sounds great for recording
and dont be too rough when winding or it will break
now for jazz and metal i use this pick
always getting the question34can i hook my keyboard into your sound board34
but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin
i would recommend these for any guitar player
i like them and my playing buddy likes them
best buy i have made on a product i couldnt try out first
its no peavey but it works just as good
i actually like this bench a lot
solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge
there are better guitars out there but not for 170
this guy really had me believing in smallvibrationtuning
i just put it on my baby taylor guitar strap
it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender
treat it gently and it will last forever
it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints
if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can
i cannot do it with one hand
i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners
you can spend more but this does what you need it to do
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and theyre just bad
i normally buy daddario strings here
after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference
good quality cable with a good price
175 for a roundback is really a no brainer
the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure
even when at low volume its tones will fill a room
im a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves
i am going to replace all my old screws with these
this looks to be well built and should be reliable
you can jam for hours with this thing its awesome
way cheaper than i saw in guitar center
it took weeks to receive them in the us
all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand
the display pivots to any angle
not a model of a champ amp the real deal
the shape and ergonomics are a mix between a kyser and a schubb s1
this levys jacquard strap is well made and comfortable
i have a similar one but it has blue fire on it
it has just become a needless expense
all i know is that it just isnt working very well for me
love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks
i got this guitar for my 9 year old son he loves it
however if you need a lot of pedal space read the dimensions
i cant really explain why they just feel right
this is made with a moveable arm between the tuner and the clip
keep it up technology gurus
i would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap
they fit they work they are quiet and they wont make your life miserable
i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound
this guitar is just for you to practice scales practice a tune
no pickguard and it doesnt need one
terrific trippy pearl tones and azures
its kind of tough at first but with experience its very easy
this is another in the mxr distortion line
not cheap or poorly made at all a great value
but chances are both will sound good
the only place is on the box after you have received the item
i also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a celestion g12h30
i just wish it had a power switch
the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark
no corner protectors on this
i cant write a great review for this
overall though its a good buy for your line 6 amp
i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar
finish playing slide your pick into this and its there when you play again
great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp
it is short but works with the small amp that i purchased
for the price this is the perfect pop filter
really reliable great sound got no complaints here really
everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing packageing and shipping
nothing as good as even a ds1 pedal
you cannot find a better guitar for this price
youll be able to hear them rattle
the metronome has a flashing light too
the pockets are very handy
please dont pay someone to setup your guitar
decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar
ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly
just to find out it wasnt working
this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard
another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves
the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off
i know theyre incredibly durable as are all boss pedals
think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier
however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build
and in general im pretty satisfied with it
i wish my car dash looked like this thing
youll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter
not much of anything is worth the money these days
strings  the ones that came on there sounded great
almost sounds like a bad recording
the tuner works like a champ
the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to 7
and its more than the switches difference which i dont use anyway
placed it on top of my 18 crash and it looks great
if youre an active performer maybe
but i got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap
it does the job but it is a little low on the quality side
easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general
mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe
some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics
what i love about this pedal is the tone knob
im running windows 7 64bit and everything installed flawlessly
even though i ordered large
that would make this one the best
i just wish i had a better feeling about the premature breakage
took them off within an hour and put back on ej16
when it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly
i should of bought this a long time ago
this strap works fine for that
it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights
im currently using the snark on my guitar
these look great and work perfectly
goes great with my guitar too
not much to say about a basic bag
its built like a rock  has a very fine finish
i use it with the medium dunlop picks
and they are absolutely right
all i can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing
they hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out
only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps
my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case
these are basically the same as schaller strap locks
turns out they are talking about a completely different item
well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one
some have noted the zoom doesnt have speakers built in
its easy to rename the files you just open wdmausbinf
if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound
i recommend this one to anyone
i definitely recommend trying out a set
i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space
overall reasonably satisfied will give them a good try later
i should have bought another one of these instead
i get everything on amazon now
all workand the distortion control
why do i like this bag better
i know it can do standard tuning i just cant figure it out
easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at least
it can do subtle lowrate lowdepth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles
i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals
4 stars seems about right
added a couple drops and it worked like a charm
ive been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970s
the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described
dont expect miracles but this helps quite a bit
i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2
my guitar thanks you as well grin
its easy to use and it overdubs
to let you know what i need in an interface 1
this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps
i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit
besides that i am totally stoked and happy with these
i dont know about a 7 or 8 string though
this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables
sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on
ive tried eh nano grail
does what it says it will do and it does it very well
you gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel correctly
it also is bright and is very accurate
no more thick calouses on the fingers
effective and built like a tank
this happened at least three times already
for the price i think its hard to get any better than this
if not your money is best spent elsewhere
bought so i could teach my son bass
i would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun
ever since i started playing the guitar ive used the nylon dunlop picks
the speeds are from 40208 bpm
install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment
the pedal comes with a 9 volt battery
hate to see how the mediums fit
i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon
this amp is a ton of fun
it is very lightweight which is also a plus
built to last and great price as well
i bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from hercules
live up to expectations and is comfortable
by the way this unit comes with a 9v battery
nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive
it really makes my solos rip
it looks and feels great on my luna butterfly
this was so inexpensive i couldnt pass it up
i continually look at it and cant believe i only paid 30 for it
i put these on and what a difference
it has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all
if your looking for an small amp
oh and the return process
the lower settings are bluesy  the higher settings are bright and dynamic
this is a fantastic little recorder but not for 300
i bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project
seems solid and well built
really nice product for the price
but is a good product
nice and stable for my classical guitar
but even so theres really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low
will be getting the amp in a day or two
i have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work
does not have good sound but hey
dual track with lowhigh volume sliders
i actually have the same criticism of my tech 21 triac really excellent pedal
this is my favorite od pedal that i have
this is a great music stand
will and have used it since
like them and never an issue
the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing
five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs 12 shipped
well you get what you pay for  leather looking paper wouldnt hold guitar
the point is this pedals so great and has a great range of dirt
construction is fine and you can set it up in 30 seconds
it sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches
they do the job brilliantly
for my limited purposes this works great
also with its size and brightblue color its anything but a stealth machine
these should last a long time as long as theyre not abused
but its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them
im not much for brand names on my guitar cases
i purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason
i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps
i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help
as a beginner these make much more comfortable
thinking about buying another one
i took it out of the box and started to play
im hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension
im now a convert too
not for guitars with nitro finish
the name is pronounced phonetically as follows  dadairyo
very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep
awesome crunch and great sustainability
whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar
a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life
very easy to take it off holds the strings tight
bought these for home karaoke and they work great
they all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers
it kept opening up even without a mic on it
in particular i favor the dual design
my only small complaint is that they dont use a center punch
so especially for the lead guitarist this should be a major selling point
this dries quickly every time
besides it wont look this good
quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather
73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick
this is just an excellent product
so far iv used it on my 67 electrics and my taylor acoustic
you cant view the snark sn4 at any kind of sharp angle
these are not 85x11 paper size
theres nothing to write about
the usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe
i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great
i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner
good material good zippers good design
once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer
for 2500 it a pretty useful pedal
it would be more suited to home or hobby use
but i do like the rotation of the display
with the humidpak you have a lot more security
it has a very natural sound is reliable and amazingly strong
the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eqd for saturated distortion
overall product quality is good
the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them
great stand holds my mid sized keyboard up very well
great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar
always good to have a stationary mic on the floor
this is my first noise reducer
and that one doesnt look like it will live very long
it works well for my home recording
i is accurate just doesnt respond to the string a fast
these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others
i am a long time user of the big fender triangular picks
awesome unit for the price very happy with it
in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it
so why this particular capo
it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe
it is not what i received
i made the r28 c11 and c12 modifications
the length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children
this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar
i especially liked the unreleased version of for your life
or where ever you play
what about the eh metal muff
you just cant beat the speed and convenience of amazon
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply
they destroy luggage so i dont think it would fair well
shipping was faster than advertised
a nobrainer as far as i can tell
and hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change
it doesnt happen when i boost my overdrives ocd  hardwire cm2
it works for what i need
it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though
goes well with my black squier strat
i am definitely a behringer fan
i thought they would be the same but they were not
also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip
still its a typical snark
after playing a while the set started to feel more natural to me
i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat
add 6 picks and start rockin
great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f335 perfectly
not the end of the world but i just dont understand why
just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection
i tried every brand until i got to these
these are not shure sm58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs
too large or stiff and you will not get the sound
now i can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2
makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body
lately i have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings
a real needed item is you play in darker rooms
its nice and easy to use
for me great studiorecording use but thats it
i am able to adjust it to the length i play with
of course its not great
elixir is my favorite brand of strings
i ended up switching to their padded strap
not sure what else you could want out of it
they bend but not easily
i have ordered 6 or 7 or these
the box for tuner was a little smushed
i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies
plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking
these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness
the most diverse pedal i own
i intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use
and nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive
the chord works great no noticeable buzz
i am done thinking a good pedal must cost 200 and above
win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes
i received it and the first thing i did is try it
seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box
this little dude weighs next to almost nothing
for the price i guess i shouldnt complain too much
so if we can save a few bucks here and there it helps
one reviewer says its made by fender
i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two
we didnt really expect much except a quick way to record ideas
not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze
the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all
the behringer 302usb premium 5input mixer is just what the doctor ordered
theres better ones out there
keep up the good work
many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed
its more like a preamp
the output is also a little less sensitive than the d5
i am so glad i did
basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion
these elliptical pins are great
but i was annoyed that they  the bushings didnt fit the standardvintagesized
i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine
for at home but i really wouldnt recomend them for gigging too much
when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion
for 8 you cant beat it
it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument
will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only
for the money i doubt you can beat these microphones
the look is not that inspiring but it protects your guitar
its heavy weight solid construction and very stable
have not used the strings yet i bought them as back up
ive used shubb for years
the unit is very heavy and rugged
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
i dont hate boss and use their superoverdrive in my chain
i cant believe im writing this but its ture
it worked just as it said it would
and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section
one user even claimed epiphone should sue him
they make a strong connection between pedals and dont sacrifice any sound quality
everything about it is exactly how you would want it to be
you will not be disappointed
very quality recordings so far
they have very little string squeak
anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing
then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages ibooks etc
i have several now one for every guitar
looks like made of good materials
the plate has five screw holes but doesnt look bad using 4
well designed and made from descent enough materials
smooth as silk work great  as all grovers do
highquality cable for expanding the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v power adapter
these fender locking tuners are top quality
the display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever
you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off
not a big deal but worth mention
works wellseems to hold up well alsotreatment lasts for awhile
i couldnt see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name
i only use aquila strings on my instruments
if you own more than 1 pedal and we all do you need this
do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one
ive had similar problems with other pyle products
they hurt my ears so clean
nope but it has some tricks up its leave for the price
the finish looks very good
my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively
a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic
granted it doesnt look as nice but it does its job
i first used this pedal when my green screemer died
i never give anything a 100
the pp400 ultracompact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like its ultracompact
pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand
the only thing i didnt like about these
i put one in each of my guitar bagscant live without it
yes this may be another tube screamer clone but its a darn great one
thats 5 stars in my book
so this switch is a useful little bonus
they really are well shielded against rfi
but i am sure other people may disagree
just clip it on tap the big button and play a note
this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height
these mikes sound almost identical the b 2000 and the shure sm
if youre into that sort of thing
use it all the time
as i said the hardware on the case is really good
i love the red burst design of this guitar it looks absolutely wicked
i tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it
this compares very closely to my high end od pedals i own
the only thing i wouldve like different is the accessory box inside
its very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap ive ever had
tried it on a martin d28
i play the soprano concert tenor and baritone
both have excellent sound quality
the locking top is a good feature as well
low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it
im a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play
more expensive is not always better
these work well with the telecaster tone and string through design
the yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as youd expect for this price
i got mine from musicians friend
the sound from a 40 pedal is outstanding much better than i ever expected
mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up
and i still dont sound like alvin lee
dont trust the products anymore
this is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings
ends are not too bad and it works for what it is
the med is pretty stiff
flexible good tone good quality
faster and more stable tuning
it takes some practice and patience
its a good quality strap and i have three of them
greatly improved the tone over the stock sovteks that where in there originally
played as well after the change as it did before
i really like this strap
the software installation is optional
and this amp is so accurate that i can
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar
all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups
something else that weighed into my purchase was durability
gives a really broken sound
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
when i unboxed this guitar i was floored
i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality
plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck
i also found using a compresser before it helps
this gauge is perfect for my 1970 gibson j50
with this amp everything is built in
i love the design and the strap holds up very well
everything is tweakable assignable and flexible
i have since gone back to delrin and nylon
my last thought on this this is a secret come closer
the strings have a nice feel to them
plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see
it has a metronome which can be fun
it fits tight but its fine
spend a few more dollars it is worth it
the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light
this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion
this is a heavy duty strap
it nails those sounds well
i can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand
violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem
this amp is non stop fun
overall good strings good sound  this set simply didnt last very long
the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin
its a hangup of mine
i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap
cheap and convenient iam not disappointed
mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine
the spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high
i am absolutely delighted with this tunner
frets were smooth rounded and played nice
this quality bag would probably cost more like 35 at your local music store
the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does
i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal
i am not a slap style player so i cant comment on that
a good piece of kit
i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing
my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led
all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark
ive never used strings that bend so well
it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do
is all i can say
it would be nice though not to have had to do that
cant hold tightly on 1st string low c a little buzz
the builtin mic records very well compared to those tiny handheld monorecorders
good quality parts on an essential product
that just means it will breakin that much more quickly
its springloaded so it comes back up by itself
im using it with an lr baggs m1a active soundhole pickup
you can run any number of power sources to it
best ukulele strings i have found to date
a lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar
take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music
a great item for the price
epiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar ebonyhello again
it was not what i wanted
ive knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged
than you normally do and give these bargainpriced nickels a try
you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks
if you can pick one up used like i did all the better
i am playing out of a peavey but i hear a tweed
so far they seem awesome
only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back
its a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny
in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57
great unit for the price
i dunno cause im stingy with stars
i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars
they bend too easily making rhythm playing impossible
daddario is my favorite string hands down after almost 40 years of playing
the snark sn1 is by far the best
its 2 what did you expect kevlar
and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box
i really like the 38 second looping function
its rugged well thought out solidly built and simple
i dont remember who makes what strings for what companies though
i had to unplugplug maneuver into place
merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix
wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables
nice and stable  no issues  works perfectly
but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing
it restored the soundpower and clearity of my amps
second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it
behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass
i loved it very much
i have a real problem with these patch cables
this little gadget does the trick
i couldnt say that i loved it
latest review the product is back at 5 stars
this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new
play an ibanez acoustic electric
the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short
this is a substantial stable very solidly built stand
the perfect accessory for the stage or studio
never fear you need to see this film
its just hard to get a clean sound out of it
youll definitely want to check these out
it was cheap and came fast
all switches knobs plugs  display work fine
wood finish is nice look on the wall
let me make it clear
dont listen to the whiners
and this guy did the job
just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices
i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac
it fits the mic well
dont use the bridge pickup as it doesnt sound too good
no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning
i just ordered 2 more of these
theyre pointy so theyre good for fast picking
it works as it should and saves time
dont worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound
they engage and disengage without binding or looseness
seems sturdy enough to last a long time
all are fast and accurate
guess i am not a gimmick person
the cleans are ultra clear and the rock tones are amazing
i havent checked yet but id say there is a 4050 loss in volume
without those picks its just black molded flab
i feel like it is a bargain at any price
it adjusts to fit different guitar necks and just sort of snaps in place
they hold a variety of guitars just fine
i bought 2 of these and will order a few more
i use it with a small amp for singing
i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin
its as good as it looks
the amp simulation is top notch
the martin m140 strings are good strings
so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing
multi color and easy to use
they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price
the pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus
to me it wasnt even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs
i am using on a yamaha board
might purchase another one eventually
guitar pics as the gods of rock intended
no to all the above
seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt
i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school
nice sound in the acoustic too
well constructed with quality woods saddlenut and bracing
turning it on though the display is quite different
thats only my opinion and everyone has one
works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro
the level knob has a lot of juice
great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply
well i found out he uses a 990 as well
these work just as well
can tune several different instruments
this also provided a additiional 3434 separation from the wall
i did and they love it
the picks are great and i couldnt be happier with the order
ive been using the daddario strings for about 10 years now
these cant support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily
the 90s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it
i wouldnt say its agreat instrument but way more than i expected for 60
id bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt
id be satisfied with the daddario they do sound good
same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with
i am old school and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful
likewise it worked well with my 4string bass as well
it stays where you set it and works wonderfully
its very easy to use and rugged
havent popped one outa my fingers yet
decided to try the dunlop
this liitle box works great for my needs
no issues at all and would order again
hope it goes away soon
you cant really get there without actual tubes being distorted
the tone has continually improved as ive broken in the speaker
the only one ive found that doesnt is the kyser
and its so cheap it wouldnt matter if you lost it
went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive
i pretty much just leave these on all the time
a 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the back
of course the board is layed out a little differently
these fit snug on my shure sm58 beta a mics
it has switches so each input can be a linein or microphone preamp
if broken or lostwho would steal it
you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal
the material is nicersofter than the original so that is a plus
they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive
i am quite pleased with this product
it is sturdy and small
ive now retired the boss pedal
this product works the way it should be
arrived early and is of great quality
i love it so much ive purchased this and my  own shure mic
for the  should be more dependable
its held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone
very smashing pumpkins feel to this
i really like this cable
its like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on
cutter works great winder makes the job really fast
if you dont have one get one
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws
above all it fits my epi lp perfectly
pads take too much presure to activate
the sound quality is amazing
both ended up in checked luggage
i got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted
the secret is always use the least you can get away with
not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago
definately get an adapter for this
sometimes lower c and lower a look alike
this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand
very cool gadget and well executed
the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal
this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well
i am a little disappointed
the 63 spring is great the plate is also really good
sure its a bit of a onetrick pony but its a pretty good trick
theyve inflated to 160 and thats just ridiculous
cheap and easy to use cant beat these picks
i totally recommend this product  you wont be dissappointed
im completely amazed with this capo
it curls around my microphone stand well too
it is tough sounds like fire and will serve you well
works well even with a room full of noise
the unit is extremely small but dont let that fool you
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do
simply it does what its supposed to do for a low price
how many of these types of noise boxes do we need
i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away
it could be less dense i think
plug  play with windows 8
could be more tapered for such a tiny pick
ive always used shure or heil mics that cost over 250
personally i just love the daddario strings
made in the usa to boot
but were talking 1000 tube amps
y con una buen duravilidad
fist off guitar center had this for 29 bucks
it delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me
this simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables
cheap accurate over mic even better over jack
theyre the cheesiest looking leather ive ever seen
i can really hear the difference between new and old strings
they bendnicely and sustain just as well
its so much better than my korg ca1
this one works better than the smaller rubber ones
perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes
a lot of players say you have to have a set glued neck
picks make a big difference to sound and playability
these things are so great
i will update if any problems arise in time
the high strings were plenty of flakes
for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever
and as an end user a upc sticker serves nobody
it was set up well and has played well out of the box
di bass is the worst
if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is
original reviewi have had similar tuners in the past
it doesnt do many different tones but what it does it does very well
i absolutely love them for my fenders
great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while
has a rich warm tone like tube mics
theyre as good for speedpicking as they are for strumming
work well to stop pops and lisps
the 7000 model does the same and doesnt take as much space
one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use
amazoncomgpproductb000ws1q4e direct box i purchased from amazon as well
behringer us600 ultra harmonistshifter pedal is pretty good
i currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate
i found it right here it  works well with no problems to report
highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost
now i cannot live without it
these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything
and 20 for a levys leather strap is a good deal
one step on the cord and it came apart
these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name
i got mine for less than 20 bucks
it is firm secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla
i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on
well worth the small cost
call me old school i hate the packaging
it also seems to be very accurate
these are a great deal
i plan on using them as backups in the studio
this is a sweet guitar strap
i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak
my disappointment is with the sound
maybe i can put a few potted plants on it
besides that its highly recommendable to anyone
easy to use and accurate
just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced
you can also just clip it to a nearby desk
the truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them
i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised
but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected
nice enough that i wouldnt check it at the airport
these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance
used this to dress up the saga tele kit i bought on amazon
my larrivee rs4 came with these and converted me to schaller
its got a better build quality than the snark for sure
this is the best capo we have out of three
this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap
when i want a more gentle muted tone i use dandrea pro 346
bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am redoing
three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility
its not meant for metal
it does all of those jobs well
very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff
works great in extremely loud environments
its just as good as any i love the joyo pedals
the unit is simple to use and the builtin microphones do a great job
its heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off
it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory
i love this little guy
other than that quite useful and durable
totally nofrills rock solid metal construction and you cant hear it at all
if you want a really good sm58 clone i would recommend a behringer xm8500
now im faced with working out all of my own presets
this was a great buying experience
one of my favorite picks ive tried for electric
the quality is great for the money
tortex picks are the best
fits any guitar banjo or even a cello
good cords with a decent length
i wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals
cheap works great for playing and foot controllers
not having a cable was kinda a big deal
good quality wired correctly cant complain
for the price very hard to beat this
the instrument just doesnt have enough power to carry some types of music
if you like warm sounds you should see something else
this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones
and the pick holder is a nice touch but
i either use the 9s or the 10s and detune them
i have used the mxl 007
as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove
the presence knob isnt a midrange control but does boost the upper mids
not much to say here but is really nice to have around
they withstand a lot of play and i dont have to replace them often
this is the last of the cool from shure
may work other applications that require the same type of plug
you can barely hear it in the next room
the strings are well made and ive never had an issue with quality
well made and easy to adjust
there is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about
with a little sanding this fit my fender american strat perfectly
i would recomed this product to everyone
anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool
in fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days
the time it saves is also invaluable
i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them
i love wicker on and tone off
thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia
you can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings
but it doesnt work right so its like running with a flat tire
they say that they are true bypass but they are not
a booster makes your signal louder
nothing else i can say  take it for cheap guitars
i bought this to replace an actual fullout pa and was very pleasantly surprised
beginnerintermediate level player would be very pleased
read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many
these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver
compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board
so far so good with this pedal
rogue g10 10w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing
ive bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit
excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend
received in just a few days
the heil pr40 is pretty good but doesnt have any onboard eq options
the guitar is new and has the strings that came with it
i bought this one and it works great
its just an imperfect design
bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from
it leads me to playing for longer periods
overall im extremely pleased with my purchase
distortion pedals go much better with solid state
if you are a bass player just buy it
a good value box set of quality products
i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable
quick install works like a dream
i put it in my cart and continued shopping
they hold up for a very long time
it claims to stop 34string talk34 when you rub fingers on wound strings
bought these for my sons electric guitar
i note that there are reviews here as old as four years
these are high quality picks
all and all for the price its a 5 star
nice part is it works on all stringed instrument
thats a winwin in my book
are they made with exotic materials
i have been in need of a tuner for far too long
i will order a smaller size
maybe the maxon made version
the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent
i dont know how eminence did it but i love it
it is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock
a 90 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration
its an optical illusion but not a sign of higher quality instrument making
it simply works well for the price paid
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
con packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks
they have been very dependable and easy on batteries
effects  there are 9 amp models ie 57 deluxe metal 2000 etc
you cant go wrong with the bright blue led either
they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country
small enough to fit on any pedalboard
you can google it for better instructions
i gave it five stars
dont force anything and you should be fine
works greatgreat little tuneri would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner
seems sturdy and well made as well
great strings and the best packaging
it could be from shipping
very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass
these schallers are exactly what i wanted
very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites
third buy it if you are looking for a new tuner
it looks amazing in use
youd be dumb not to get one while theyre cheap
i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one
not even holes for them
strong spring that good start
if you dont have these already you better purchase them now
i play 5string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff
the cord that comes with it is worth more than that
even with that little extra expense youll come out ahead
not the fingers but the hand and wrists so
you can connect an ipod or laptop to it
i cant imagine not using it now that i have it
other reviewers commented on accuracy
however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems
a dab will do ya
the leg that you can use to prop this up isnt very usable
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
but i like them a lot
the finish is much darker then the pictures online show
all the hype and positive reviews you read are all true
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install
this mic gives a great range of recording purposes
it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate
its not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives
i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio
it matches the mic well colorwise and fit
i knew i had found 34my strings34 after a short time playing with these
for the price it should be and is great
i bought this to use on my fender pbass
solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect
yes this pedal is made of high strength plastic
but this is a great stand
i like it its ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion
if you never used it get a can you wont regret it
im pleased with both stamps
so far it still works well
and it arrived a day early
planet waves signature guitar picks  always the best always reliable
will last forever sound great
if you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star
still this is a good deal
this is a quality stand
i thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk
these are well worth the cost
i dont know about the
id recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there
i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic
i use a keeley in my live shows
and really any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes
several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it
its well constructed and i have not encountered any issues with the twopiece bottom
they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones
the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords
their tone is slightly bright but not as 34harpsichord34 as the exp
with interior pocket to put your accesories like capo string winder etc
the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry
ill update this review if i have more to report
they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings
i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
i have recommended this stand to others also
first it did not appear that anything was coming out
id read a lot about the one spot power system
seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick
excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right
great accessary for yamaha keyboards
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first
it does 80s hair band and 80s metal very well
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this is just adequate for my use
its the latest boss delay pedal
pedaltrain makes a great pedal board
new tuners like the snark sn8b are a joy in comparison
so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money
now its in the effects loop just like my other delay
power to the pedals rock on
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at2020 yes
i bought a cheap 34 guitar that sounded really bad
this is my second and i love them so much
with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood
pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards
but for now i am very pleased with this tuner
it will probably outlast the guitar
but thats where the similarities end
with priceassortment in mind i give 5 stars
one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on
another doesnt and is very clean even on the factory preset clean
i would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication
for a number of reasons
just to make sure you have the proper humidity level
mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping
it is plastic but it suits my needs
the plastic housing might not standup to the road
chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes
but as far as run around and taking lessons
i also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument
its a fact of life
and i like the sound better
need a little variety in your life
this pedal does exactly what it says its supposed to
i will definitely purchase this kit again when i run out of the supplies
nice bright and full sound
daddario always puts out a nice product
it isnt the softest strap
the teens really liked the colors to choose from and i like the price
ive 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsthe intellitouch is simply champion
the jack was visibly wiggly too
the protector needs to be longer
i did like the style size and color
some may need a clamp
why no 5 star review
i started using these a few years ago
on my el cheapo violin these strings sound quite nice
it may not be much to look at but it works really well
it cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid
on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy
for 7 dollars its a really good deal
this amp is perfect for me
but some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle
super vivid easy to see color
this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hardearned callouses soft
this was a great purchase
i like it4 star rating according to amazon
packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require
ive been playing for about 17 years
they cost a little more than other strings but theyre worth it
dont think ill fool anyone but what the heck
it said it was brand new
i recomend trying one out some time
it works really well and its really thin
there is no hum when the unit is on
ill make a video and post it soon
the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precisionmachined
the capsule is surrounded by this truncated conelike metal screen enclosed on all sides
you cannot go wrong with this mixer
in fact i sold the delay and slow mo recently
for the price and intent i almost gave it 5 stars
comes in a pouch which helps to put it away
this little tool will prevent that
but im glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test
especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time
the color in the pictures doesnt do it justice
i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics
the strings dont break either
the led is really bright
i have several clipon tuners that clip directly to the headstock
i have 100 confidence this will never tip over on its own
i will experiment with different instruments  write more about the quality later
im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder
i found that out quickly
they make two  a 3430034 and a 3440034
i bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar
ive been using the blue tortex picks for about 14
the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys
i have several of these capos one for each instrument
but its just not a good product
so make sure you try before you buy
the strings sound great and hold up to the 34whammy34 just fine
i have an epiphone dot and i installed a bigsby v5 on it
analog dry signal thru with digital delay
the neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing
nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though
i feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better
very happy with my purchase
why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe
this is a great tuner
i use the chair for guitar bass keyboardsukulele and even cooking breakfast
both picks have their own unique tonal character
these strings are the bomb
i own a red blue and now a black one
never had one bad set out of over a hundred
thats not uncommon among studio monitors
if you dont try one
jc clean black panel brit combo and rfier mean nothing to me
i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex
customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this
first of all it is a beauty
i really dont have anything more to say about it
a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily
this one seem to perform just fine
also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me
stock this tuner was awful
years ago i used the clayton 34small teardrop34 picks
this was an impulse buy
price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on
it certainly wont be for everybody but so far i like what i hear
i dont know what i was expecting
my bassplaying has gone on for 50 years
thats one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals
this product has improved my productions beyond its price sold
it also helped with the rather high action
if you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin
its easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician
i replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar
it also has a worththepricealone space feature
wire frayed at the right angle jack
the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke
they work great were easy to assemble and not expensive
a power conditioner will sometimes help as well
even as i learn the notes on the guitar fretboard
when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened
once you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhere
the nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear
the tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable
after 40plus years of playing daddario rocks
good product at a good price
my fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought
all snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner
the display is good and the tuners work well
also use these on my taylors
be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off
also the case is nice
easy to take with you or set on a small shelf
i would recommend this to anyone
great for a quick practice and really sounds nice
the balance between quality and price is good
i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s
they can be switched back and forth even while youre sustaining a note
nothing special just the will to get used to it
extra light gives good action for my small guitar
then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm
well i dont really know what else to say
the price is fair for all that
high quality hassle free design
for those folks these will elimiate the resulting pings and such
great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these
i never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor
at that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy
i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades
are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication
if you use more than 2 of 10 max gain it sounds awful
the davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control
dont expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though
for me this is perfect doesnt make any noise with my conections
two downsides both are about the noise
not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise
maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise
after i plugged this little bad boy in it brought my amp to life
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
the description on amazon fits the c1u not the c1
does what you want and need and looks great
i bought one for every bass and a spare
some people say they are too slick
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
this is my second black suede leather strap ive bought from levys
i think its a good choise for any pedalboards
maybe a preamp would have helped
noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price
maybe thats what they mean by balanced tension
otherwise this is a nice strap
quality at the right price
as the title says these are a great value and work well
i bought this along with a clayton large glass slide
and no digging the the parts bin for screws
the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver
with a twang twing twong nothing wrong
the screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight
it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch
it responds really well to my pick attack
ive wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
im so proud of my balls
it is a very handy tool
there are scores of chromatic tuners on the market
it works well for holding up a guitar and it looks good doing it
there are no frills and theres no latency
the classical musicians in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something
forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal
i am now a believer
its a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder
hangs my guitar around my neck so i dont have to hold it there
good cheap strings for guitar
all my guitars use this quick release clip
it has plent of volume which is good for boosting
i use mine  daily and it hasnt failed me yet
needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget
for value and use as a wee pa its a 5 star deal
i paid a lot more for the gibson and 149 bucks for this epiphone
a little goes a long way
my kids are all interested in learning the uke
i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this
these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price
i used the standard dunlop nylon for years
they are easy on the fingers
they sounded great all up  down the fret board
i am very happy with how it performs in both situations
i dont drop em anymore
the toneprint feature is amazing
i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly
ive had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing
from stereo to 51 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs
b  recorded dr40 and printed to cd
it feels solid wellconstructed and not very heavy
its durable and works perfectly
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
but this is the original and the best
for the money you cant beat it
listening to music on them is a joy
very high quality and a sleek look
i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition
this was a filler item for a much larger order
without debate this will add weight to your guitar
across the web reviews for the to800 are uniformly favorable
threaded fine and its heavy enough for any mic youve got
work much better then the other style of string trees
quality is really outstanding for the price
i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones
this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned
on the metal channels it really drives the gain over the top
nothing but chinese crap for sale anymore
this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow
nice cushion on both sides  onstring and the back of the arm
they said well mine was only 45 and mine was only 40
however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot
this combo string winder peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately
upgrade it to something better
it feels safe and secure
best purchase ive made this year
the newest pair live in my gym bag
its fast and easy to use
well padded and has enough carrying options
the legs are easily removable for storage
longer scales like a strat
i bought the case for the case not for the included harps
so why only 4 stars
amazon comes through again on price and product
what more can you ask for at roughly 2500
measuring for fit and specifications is on the money
it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in
well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions
i dont think this can be beat
im a beginner and i try to learn to play guitar
this picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones
its very simple and is perfect for me
works as advertised for my purpose
i would recommend others to try it
its not rocket science to make them work
if the strings are in individual labeled packages theres no need for the colors
dont let the system absorbs you
it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks
they have a long life and do brighten your tone
ive not yet had a broken string with them
my guitar doesnt fall down anymore
but good product and price
you end up using just the right ammount
i do not like them
cant argue with that track record
wow yes that is it
5 stars because of the price and what i was expecting to get
except for that 22nd fret oh well
it works as a beginner tool but only that
these mopads are pretty amazing
actually while the amp is cheap its also fairly durable
this is definately worth the money
i put a baggs ibeam pickup in it also
i also use the ghs standard
this really does shine up your wood quite well
no big deal really unless youre a real tone freak
so be aware of that
sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords
you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks
you cant go wrong with this stand
excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic squire strat series
easy to use and the clip is sturdy
for 13 its hard to say anything bad about this gadget
brass tacks  is this the greatest mic in the world
are usually north of 200 which isnt practical for a casual player
solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience
when playing at home ill use the more gentle schubb
and then there is the the metalonmetal clankyness
plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game
theyre like most other brands medium
great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board
a very wellmade strap with great looks and a super price
the next day the guitar neck looked and played great
not all uke players use straps some do and some dont
how about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall
but this product was a waste to me
most of my recording lately has been done with various apple platforms
ghs strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these
punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range
other than that your can change amount of distortion
it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it
that is a great strap and has held up wonderfully
this strap is really beautiful
originally putoff by the low price i went with the reviews
it is so accurate and works great so far
this is also a pretty handsome looking caseif thats what you care about
whatever i didnt like about them got drowned out when i tried electric
im a pro musician and music teacher
has a great sound in my opinion
thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt
if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise
best strings for my ukulele
i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget
there are a few more different models and brands that are good
the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths
there are exactly as described and do the job
very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong
otherwise sound quality is excellent
switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato
the system is super easy to use and store on your amp
the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well
the weight is great for my style of playing
cant wait to see how it does after it breaks in
so for linux users this may be a very attractive option
they had a very nice and balanced mids and highs
1st time i saw it was 40 years ago
this is not worth the money
the 2 important things are not in bullet  the sustain and the sound
anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed
like the title says the timeless combo of neutrik  mogami is better
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano
aside from that this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit
i also have a small peavy 50 watt solid state combo
a tricky process at best
its a must have and thats really all there is to say
my gear used for testing  fender american deluxe stratocaster
i feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing
its just a great option to have for casualbudget guitarists
if your experience is like mine youll be very satisfied
or it could just be in my head
its go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel
from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only 40
awesome value for the price
i always keep these around during string changes
this is a very transparent compressor
bought this rosin to see how i would like it
but i think if youre lucky if just might get the job done
also i compared them to the sennheiser hd201
i plugged it into a small guitar amp
i own the old ibanez ts9 that i modified to the original keeley specs
it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat
nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board
theyll be easy enough to fixreplace when they fall off so no worries there
its holding a gibson les paul so it has to be trustworthy
these will work for soprano
i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily
it is a concert size which i like
versatile and great to work with
later saw this one and decided to try it
still i think is a good tool to have
id say the effects are just soso
virtually every genre is represented here
these strings feel great and sound fantastic
nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad
the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend
they are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap
i own several of the snark tuners
never had any problems with them
i did buy some more expensive magami ones and i cant tell a difference
mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
this is my 3rd vox amplug i have purchased through amazon
it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke
looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand
okay but i have a pickup want the mellower tone sans finger noise
i am six feet tall
both ends are a loop
they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great
great value good quality and sound
im gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp
the g7th performance capo is priceless
i use mine on a martin hd28 and have had no problems whatsoever
34 i also prefer the sn2 display
the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in
i guess i dont like the way the uke sounds when using them
these are great for connecting effects pedals
its a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done
the stand is sturdy too
my strings stay in tune even better with this installed
at least i know that they fit snug
after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case
i will use it until i can find a better one
its okay but it could be better
but it is perfectly adequate for most purposes
its a guitar instrument cable what can i say
they sound great to me personal opinion of course and are priced right
my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff
i imagine it would work great for lead players but im a rhythm player
looks good and has the fender logo prominent
for the tube amp snobs
its quite expensive for 4oz
no metronome but thats what im keeping the korg for
this guy filled the need
overall extremely happy with this purchase
and find a nice set of strings
and purchased a license for reaper
it was held by only one small tac weld
this product is great i use it after every session
arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger
exactly as described and very affortable
i use is this mount to support a samson meteor mic
first off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable
im just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider
ive read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also
the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most
its really smallnoticeably smaller than the red jazz iii picks
it clips to my guitar strong and stays put
i found that i had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal
i bought 2 of these hangers and theyre rocksolid
i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together theyre fail safe
music 123 is a musicians friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars
the bad news is that this configuration is very buggy
still id rather stick with a copper slide
does a great job of checking cords
plus the price is right
these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer
i have several for our electrics and acoustics
for a cheap 808 clone this is the best i have used hands down
this little device is more than worth the money
overall i found the available tones to be excellent
dont let the term 34nylon34 fool you
now we have the beehold picks
these are nicely made and the one i bought is working well
the highs were clean and bright
this is a great little addition to both my violin and my mandolin
it cost 99 and i figured i got less than what i paid for
i am thinking of selling my bass
ive tried them all and i like the shubb the best
not a finger print on it anywhere
easy to use and quality built
this just was my choice this time
this is definitely a high quality cable
i thought id give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews
this stand works fine if you dont need a shock mount
based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these
save your money and buy a better cable
it does what its supposed to that other capos dont do
it shipped in an envelop
this guitar is wonderful and sounds great
no buildup or residue on your fingers either
oh and this goes without saying upgrade the stock strings
but this is my favorite muff thus far
it works well with several different instruments that i have
the boss ac3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator
check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord
its a small amp but its bigger than i thought it would be
the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad
just clip it onto the bridge
but its been a trial  error for me
hope this helps with your decision
this guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was
the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think 34perfect34
after watching a side by side comparison on youtube i decided to buy one
dont put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years
all you need is a 10mm socket and your are set
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
the response of the exps sounds very consistent to my ears
these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch
one was an ev and the other a rather costly older peavey
and that my friends is the problem
the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
i would definately buy more
but they may work fine on lightly braced guitars
it does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back
because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs
i had to tune my guitar and i bought this
if you are picky these are all eye candy
for guitar bass or keys
id think its was a cheap knockoff childs guitar
hands down the best pick ive used
i regret this purchase for what i paid for it
super leather very well puttogether
different in a wow way
the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out
the padding is better that i expected
if you use various guitars on gigs this pedal is very useful
is it a monster cable
no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested
i would not recommend this pedal
i think its better than the sovereign
works just as i need it to
roll of the dice i guess
replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand
bought this on a whim
actually i bought two of them
oo if you have a burkes outlet near you
this is a great value
then switch to aquilas for playing
my original review very easy to install didnt require drilling
i have had 2 of these tuners youd think id learn after one
i cant recommend this enough and the battery last a long time
the back clamps firmly to the guitar without maring the finish
tried as i might i could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of
it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for
in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money
unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black
by far the best acoustic strings period
ive owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw
the build quality of the mic is excellent
the strap is about 6 too short for my seagull s6 guitar
mine opens and closes ok and the lock works
i ordered two pdmic58s and they came with an xlr to 14 cable included
not as a professional tube driver but quite well for the price
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isnt very friendly
cable looks great  feels of high quality
it has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesnt
i decided to go cheap and got the rp255
it has a midsweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone
i had some noise even at moderate volumes
i have 4 of these so far will get more if needed
i bought one and had the same experience
it is very similar to a guitar in many important ways
it is so simple and so reproducible
the resulting sound is absolutely topdrawer and completely belies the incredibly low price
bottom line is that it works very well for my needs
2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars
not much to say about a xlr cable
this thing can do anything
using it on an acoustic dreadnought and its plenty long enough
this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box
i hated having to put the pick between strings
as with all boss  roland products the boss fs6 performs as designed
for the price this is a great deal
its a guitar strap it does the job and looks good
perhaps i got the wrong thing
if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up
the nodelay headphone jack is great
so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented
for 99 dollars  quit looking at other wah pedals
i wasnt happy that its form was deformed
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum
this is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range
big bold bottom end with some singing highs
really satisfied with the chair
theyre not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones
hope they work when they do finally arrive
this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments
i am very happy i did
our son has four or more of them too
i liked the big boss tu1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations
first and foremost  use single coils
not to mention boutique quality at a working mans price
from simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all
the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation
very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows
the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made
a little disappointed with the cable
i use this mainly with a double neck bassguitar
you get what you pay for
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks
its almost like having two stompboxes in one
it is after all a cheap chinese stand
there are other solutions to this dilemma
im a really happy customer now
both ends are the same  leather
there are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the windows handles sound
yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible
there are something special about these strings
i purchased this for my daughter who is 10
i ordered this bench for last christmas 2005
i have 2 of these actually
ive always liked the parametric eq on this pedal
the primary draw here is the bright lightup display with wide color bars
you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise
anyone else noticed different color leds
this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used
my daughters use all of them every week
the strap wouldnt hold my guitar any longer
my favorite is this delay and the echo
the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps
this tuner is a real good buy at a good price
these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings
really wanted to like this one because i loved the price
great guitar by the way for the price
i own several small tuners including the enote nano tuner and the snark
so far it has been wonderful for intonationinitial setups
at orange county and amazon
it is cheap to buy at amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning
i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years
not what i thought i was getting  dumb me
it works well pretty good buy
im a bass player and so i dont deal with cut picks much
i have the kt7800 which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust
i have used a few different capos this is far and away my favorite
its light but stays in place okay
saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car
im using it more then i thought i would when i first bought it
overall they work really well and look sharp
60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic dunlop pick
this was a great compromise between portabilitystorage and sturdiness
with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that
i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal
the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small
i am happy with it
and also for the money a great deal
it sounds much much better now
ill keep it as a spare just in case anyway
also i believe the very best value for the dollar
i like the playability of the
i was on the fence about whether it was my winner
drop few more bucks and get something else
running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong
the dimensions are  41l 14w at bout and 3 deep
i am going to be waxing now on
ive used this live since i got it and it works great no problems
like the retro tweed look and the sleeves that go under the ts jackets
the plugin accessory is great and my pedal board has an outlet
when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy
fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap
the best strings i ever bought and ive bought them all
i would highly recommend this to others
it does exactly what it says it does
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
i suggest ordering some better ones
its tri pack with great quality strings on good deal
they play extremely well and last a long time
now a word about open back banjos if you are considering this stand
really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality
if you own special 20s then you already know how good they are
reading the product description may give you an idea about this product
and it really works well for home practice situations
fender cords look great and work just as well
i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me
overall they are just not as good
a little goes a long way
other than that it seems to work well
this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online
34  ive been used to the traditional 3position switch on my other telecasters
i cant expect miracles at that pricepoint but i certainly expected better
the wider clip spreads the stress out
however the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws
for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once
i placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer
sound very good and for the price it cant be beat
perfect for clear loud picking
works great for changing guitar strings
i have had several mxr pedals through the years
simple light and does what its suppose to
tends to slip on the strings however
as a musician im in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner
but these microphones were a game changer for me
i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it
played well right out of the box
picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed
cant go wrong for the price
to my surprise there wasnt even any tape on it
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
the only con i could give is if they go bad
it does a fine job
i loadedthe effect into a slot
no fancy designs but a great value for the price
thats what i always say
i will be buying more of these
theydont get in the way when being used but look almost out of place
i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads
easy to assemble and use
the cloth is just what i wanted
theres no instruction which is fine
its a great musicians party favor
cons  a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass
take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean
the bass attack pedal did not disappoint
better strings are worth the extra cost
ok so they are just screws
it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it
if its not good at least youre not out a lot of money
a nice extra piece of flexibility
its a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in
its the only strap ive ever used
wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free
id recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like
i love these cheap little pedals
if the behringer dies its going in the trash and ill buy another one
martin is a name that means quality
when i tested it out i was blown away
i bought anew bow for 62100 so
very well made and beautiful
the sound quality is surprisingly hot
this is a great effect
first behringer pedal i have returned
im a huge fan of daddario strings
i wanted an amp that would have overdrive and i also wanted some power
ive been playing for 29 years and i highly recommend joyo pedals
its nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play
these daddarios do both things and do them well
it is also very sensitive when set to room recording
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes
the to800 gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank
i would also by the dunlop lemon oil as well
good grippy picks for some types of playing
my verdict   go with medium or hard version
a welldesigned strap that looks and works really nice
just as good as any 20 xlr out there
i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar and what a difference
this small stand does not hold most all ukes
other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends
i cant practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv
however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several
the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth
the tone as i say is pretty darn good
it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads
just what i needed to position my guitar while seated
lastly the old standard dyna comp
it gives me great sounds
it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet
i have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on
cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue
i really like this stand
i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine
this cuts strings with no problems
this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals
i love the size and wouldnt want anything larger
you cant go wrong with the ts9
they are much more precise nearly good enough to intonate an instrument
no complaints about this hardware
presets tap tempo and a nice feature set
good product after you get it assembled
ive always been partial to
quality german manufacturing as always
i hate overprocessed guitar tones
once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product
i was immediately struck by how solid this case feels
no tubes means no tube issues
pacific hardware is excellent right up there with tama
i like them so much i bought another one
i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time
very simple and works very well
i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place
i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space
no there is still a little digital overlay around in there
always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm
dont even hesitate buying this thing
this is the new and improved snark
for the price this is one great little dynamo
the first one worked great and so does this one
i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter
these will now be my default locks
the case is also really well made good zippers and stitching
ive been using ableton for 4 years and it never crashes
ill try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said
very happy with this purchase
it is worlds better than usb mics like the blue snowball
i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price
the price is right and they keep them safely stored
it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe
these harps have no volume
that last 14 63mm of movement on each leg was worth 100 improvement
i love the sound but dont want to change strings every week
i always use ernie ball on everything
this corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out
what this tuner has  accuracy usability durability versatility
as a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks
i really like the mediums
the portability factor is huge in my opinion
just what i was looking for
once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now
i use it for my small solo gigs
i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smellfree case
several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck
good quality strong and excellent finish
i will buy more if i get another guitar
downside seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings
this stand is very good
this amp really surprized me
i would not suggest this to anyone
a good moderately priced guitar stand
these are only good for garage practice on a budget
i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago
not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some
works great as a stand for the elec
for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable
and roundwounds just didnt have that acoustic sound
i definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together
my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them
so what if its not 100
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
i love the pick attack with these
no worries though now im learning my new favorite instrument
i dont detect any loss of tone
be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less
sturdy welldesigned and frets the strings well
you might even become the next joe satriani
the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job
good  cable works for me using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch
dont hope to take chords on it
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy
the legs make this thing very very wide
this is good quality for the price
in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat
it works great so far
they are smooth and bending is a breeze
i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up
not too much but at least something
if lost or stolen id buy another
for one thing this is a guitar ill always enjoy having around
ive never had any issues with this
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
seriously for the price these cant be beat
i could not believe the sound quality
i was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar
very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing
i would buy more if i needed them
so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input
i liked these a lot
bottom line  this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price
all that said i still gota give the item its due
one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ
still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick
easy to hold and very soft
he hasnt had any problem with the capo yet
it does not hypnotize beautiful women
they are durable and have a nice tone
they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too
they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification
overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be
ive played this pedal for a while now and really dig it
more importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedalboard space
i havent seen much more expensive ones with these features
i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing
all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase
takes you hours to play around with all the sounds
i ordered a pitch black for 70
but i figured how can you go wrong
the one i got is labeled both on the package and on the clip
from stern to port this instrument shines
once together it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably
you can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it
its 15 watts but its loud
it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone
it only works with a power adapter no battery
i dont require professionallevel equipment so this cord serves my purposes well
also it quit working suddenly after about a year
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product
bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings
some other people have made the same discovery also
i have more room and control with this pedal
for the price the honeytone cant be beat
i have used dunlop straplocks for 32 years
the 3 modes are nice
a string is in tune when the rings stop rotating
i can deal with it
this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level
youre still getting a good deal
this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
my fretboard hasnt been cleanedoiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry
cant even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like
this was very easy to put together
it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever
well if you do you need strings
its sturdy and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position
i wouldnt buy anything but elixirs for years
im only sad they dont make a noise gate or something similar
this pedal works great and doesnt slide at all
thats a total of 12
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it
it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping
second this instrument is no lightweight either in heft or playability
just a basic female xlr to 14 inch male adapter
i like the pick pocket too
this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length
these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy
great speaker stands well constructed easy adjustments for different setups
outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time
doesnt make a difference in the sound
the quality is good i would say  not great but not terrible either
vibe is very trower like
the price went up nearly 50 on them though
if you need cables these work great
maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me
it wont a guitar break
overall though i am very happy with the way this stool feels
tried them on a gibson j50 and they seem to do good
but i did have to give up tube amp option
i must say though that i had no idea it would be so huge
before we get started i am more pro than amateur
for 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion
while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and visversa
the next thing to do is to block the tremolo whammy mechanism
for that purpose these are made well
also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning
you wont go wrong with this capo
playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking
i got it to have it if i needed it
and it was necessary to the group
nowafter i did this it is sweet
tunes all my instruments fast and easy
i love them on my strats
it only says what the product does have
i have no complains about it
i just wish i had found this guitar sooner
almost all of the reviews i read were positive
2 1534 speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet
this pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out
however i returned them because they are not locking
you cant beat the price
they are a sturdy but lightweight stand
distortion pitch shifter chorus then out
i also know what notes are in each chord
these great little accessories are a nice convenience
i bought this right angle 10 red cable for my older ibanez guitar
works like the picture shows
you dont care about a telescoping boom and2
the great part about it is the design
the pick pocket is cool though i wont be using it
he mentioned the need for one so got it
ive used elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again
good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point
well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning
i had previously owned it digitech jam man i also try the boss
terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly
the ability to control it with an external pedalswitch
this neat little tuner has it all
it is as good looking in person as in the pictures
this is a great complement to study theory
the construction is sturdy metal and actually heavierfeeling than a boss pedal
it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the onoff switch does nothing
great little tuner very accurate and portable
it gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft
this capo isnt quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar
i am so happy she did
this is a musthave item for drummers and the wellorganized
5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer
it is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well
easy to plug in i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband
for the money you cant beat it
not much to say about a chrome neckplate  its largely a cosmetic item
these stands are great for my lesson business
works perfectly for me it does got a nice made
alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like hendrix
i only use the clean side or input one
at the time i figured all picks were created equal
i cant brag on them enough
for 100 if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well
if you aint intelligent good luck
very well built cable and so far no hum at all
i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in
lets say you use an xt or a x3
i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc
its pretty easy to overpower the computers input and cause distortion
it really nice made in canada not china wow
i found that it just added more weight
the last and make playing a breeze
california with the classic fender name scribed
no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing
i now have these tuners on an american strat and an american tele
so im sending it back
tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results
this has been a very useful tool
loose grip little sweat slick finish
i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot
not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still
it has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse
plus this will look good on camera
the portable feature is great also
they hold a nice amount of picks
tubulaarrrrholds my 8 string 6 string acoustic etc
the tone of my ovation was back
they were both amazed with the sound
very happy with this low cost strap
they look good and perform well
man what a great sound
wow best ever in this category
it also lacks 14 plug one rca input you need an addapter
great pedal and it is still built like a tank
i use it in front of my shure beta 58a and its absolutely perfect
ok 6 trs patch cables 6 long each for 3000
very good deal for newbies like me
they work well for that
why are these little elliptical end pins so brilliant
it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read
when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly
but these are great and you should get em
mics are like pants you have to find the right fit
i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less
i used a manual ratchet screwdriver
the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well  it delivers massive fuzzplussustain
this is the pedal to own
i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way
not to mention that its hard to strum and sounds awful
tuning then became a breeze
folds up if needed for travel
the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch
make sure the voltage matches
i dont know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not
i dont use distortion pedals
this will definitely last a long time
curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate
i have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons
i still recommend the mic though
it will help you tame this pedal into what you want
each one sat just right
i would highly recommend this especially at the price
so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you
the surface is matte and not too slick
maybe try those but im sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops
and i love the tweed cover
very smooth action when using the vibrato
i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead
i really like the cherub pickup
if you want 90 sound reduction however you will need a metal mute
i got this for our church
they fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads
just well made and functional
its super cheap and i dont mean the price
i have tried several different brandstypes of tuners in my 13 years of playing
i returned mine as it just didnt fit well for my uke or mandolin
amazon is great to deal with
im 6 so it might not be high enough for a very tall person
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
call me a satisfied customer
this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal
but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort
look it up on youtube
the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 34 size ether
the 9led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern
i have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic this being the second acoustic
seems great need more time to explore what it can do
this plug works very well
and i have to really hammer on them to trigger
nice to have the whole set again
sturdy provides good support and looks good
it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection
i would definitely recommend it to a friend
for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start
ive used one of these before and dont remember it having lock washers
it has truly elevated my playing a few notches
im a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished
for this price 15 you simply cant go wrong
but it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient
very pleased with the product and price
i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp
my expectations were frankly low
not much to say here other than it works and works well
fits perfectly in sound hole
i didnt realize it was so small
i think i have 3 or 4 of these
this manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars
it fits my jasmine es31c dreadnought acousticelectric guitar just fine
i was impressed by the quality of this product
good lows and clean highs without any hiss
go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s
it was worth the wait
but for the price it does work a lot better
i will be selecting solely on price
i will use them again in the future
ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you
i paid about 75 for mine and have zero regrets
i would definitely buy these strings again
after reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what i needed
except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels
buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone
the high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep
it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar
we got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar
the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out
they have a great rating from other musicians
the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing
this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugerabehringer product
the base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it
thats about the only pro
i use audacity to amplify when necessary to normalize always and to edit from
until i can install it i can only really vouch for 45 stars
this will work with my daughters ipod touch generation 4
i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily
i would definitely buy them again
010s in stock as well as over a dozen
but its not a 5star cable
and they dont move around so much like with the bigger triangle one
you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud
with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it
for the price of these strings you cant go wrong
this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized
sam ash was very courteous in fixing the problem
the primary difficulty was in the how the users manual was written
it had been a while since i had some ebs
just squeeze and slide it where you need it
my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin
its also squeakily noisy when string winding
you wont be let down
for the bread this is a great strap
it holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed
these are a staple on every single guitar in our band
first of all i love the crybaby 535q and i recommend this wah pedal
the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change
not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso
far as i can tell good strings
you also still might need your other fx
i have purchase 2 to see how they were
the case is very nice and sturdy
i use this tuner to tune up my violin
absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret
the bench is also larger than my others
not that many good productsaccessories for ukuleles
excellent price and product is as described and price was right
this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble
im still using my roland stomp box tuner
who said learning the guitar was difficult
the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up
i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications
i love these little guitar stands
great great great great great great great great great
i usually use it as a midboost for solos
mr miyagi couldnt have said it any better
the grill and the frame around the grill are solid
anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill
remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor
it replaced my roland boss tu12h
i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp
they are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding
bone does make a considerable difference i have found
my first elec guitar im 60 years old and this guitar is perfect
you can also reassign the presets to different effects
this is a pick for the precision player
some things just dont need to change
i can give these away to beginners that dont have a capo
understandable as it was made and shipped from indonesia
and the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other
this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings
i buy these for my son
no but it doesnt cost as much either
they already have your money
it was easy to install and the finish was perfect
should the need arise it is also easy to disassemble and assemble
this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal
the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed
i dont this is it for meat least not on acoustic
and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer
slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter
you really will not be disappointed with these
the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze
it has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch
for the money its a great pedal
then theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed
it could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps
but i am going to keep using my dadario strings from now on
the orig still the best
013 which frankly i cant feel
will need to check them next week or so
i have never been much of a fan for coated strings
this is a good budget uke
much better than a standard clip on a mic
always the best string i buy
personally i prefer the snark tuner but these are a fairly close second
they dont know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings
is that this thing is heavy
ever since i just bring a bass and this pedal
this one was a huge disappointment
each to their own i suppose
i just got my snark tuner and im very impressed with it
great price i own many of these
seagull to me is overhyped
theyre an industry standard for a reason  you dont need 15 dollar strings
really cool looking and are nice picks for the
string sound is a personal thing
so far no problems at all
it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd
one of the the best lights i own
what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led
great fender quality for a great price
that said the only thing i like about this order is the case
that tube is an excellent storage tube
when it comes to music it is34 that little extra34 that makes the difference
the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined
that may seem like a small issue
you could say that requires two hands in order to remove it
for many years ive been playing with proel and 34fender34 cables
arrived fast had them up and running in minutes
this is the greatest practice amp ever
it has one small pit in the red finish
its speaker is a 10 inch 8ohmspecial design fender
i have several of these straps in different colors and ive never been disappointed
the rubber feet are also smaller
its a little stiff and im sure it will soften up upon more use
well made and you cant beat the price
worked out of the package and was cheap
it literally gave me chills
this is easy to remove
i am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands
i got both hi and lo g sets
i have purchased six of these over the last couple years
but why not give these lighter strings a try
this is more for your parlor acoustic setup
works great and no noise
its possible that i just lucked out with a good one
another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site
they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced
spend some more money if you want something good
you need a boom stand
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
it sounds so much nicer
just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner
these are great patch cables especially for the price
i have tried the intel krog boss etc
this particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar
it seems as accurate as my other tuners
i had a lot of questions and concerns when i ordered this
it was 4 dayspast the delivery date
i now rate it at 5 stars
this is good for the money
behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc9
theyre elixirs you just cant go wrong with elixirs
the sn2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn1 doesnt
im giving 5 stars because daddario makes great strings
this takes care of that problem for a couple of bags
my friend hated that part too and i agree with her
light weight and very portable
however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise
this thing should sound louder next time ill buy a duncan pickup
like my first hosa cable this is a high quality item
otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference and it should
was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat
and take your time and this device should work fine
the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button
i take my trusty fender esquire
it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target
they are a little scratchy on the edges
i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings
other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal
as of now i hardly use them at all
no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly
they are not expensive to replace
note   this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack
i would pay the price again in a hartbeat
do not use these or any other foam for that matter on nitro finishes
it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me
as other reviewers have indicated a squier bullet
this little stand serves so many purposes for me
im very satisfied with this pick
see the picture and youll understand how it works
the box is very good quality with nice large controls and metal foot switch
purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that
this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod
i would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet
still have my effects rack
guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features
this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar
i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too
i am so happy with my changes
it does its job in fantastic fashion but doesnt last the longest
lastly these plugs are huge
i love reverb and wouldnt buy an amp without it
stop reading this and order them
maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit
ill report back if it doesnt happen again for a while
it belongs in front of a tube amp period
its handy having the wire cutter built into it
it shipped on time and the packing was good
they are plastic and will wear out someday ill buy another pair then
the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors
i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick
all speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot
i play for fun and relaxation
the absolute best guitar stand made
thought the guitar is beautiful ive had it for a while
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot
excellent product it is well cushioned
its different sounding from the crybaby wah
ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal
my choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics
not easy to set up hard to tighten down
5 plus stars for this one
the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar
then your oktava will fit just fine
5 feet is a weird length for a cable
its tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe
good quality for my casual use
this has come in handy many times in my studio z108net
even the light picks are thicker than the 34thin34 picks i had ordered before
i did this drawing on my guitarplaying knowledge
ive tried several 34portable amps34
some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to 35db
youll still have a nice cord you can use on any mic
this guitar is extremely well made and put together right
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
crisp and fresh tone for a long time
tiny and seems to be accurate
so many things i have developed
this is so darn cool
for lead i needed to use something harder
and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has
mine initially came with middle position
i wouldnt buy anything else
as far as durability goes they are the reigning champs
ive been using it for a few weeks and im extremely happy with it
i currently own 60 or so guitars
its for bedroom use only
it was a pain to take out too
i will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables
if they d35 sounded dull id notice
the beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response
but heres my issue the distortion is not crunchy
you cant go wrong with daddario strings
for the price i was really happy with it
these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool
my capo is 8 years old
id suggest buying them by the gross
i think they might have made it a little more durable since then
i highly recommend this quality xlr cable
a little stiff but im hoping it will loosen up with use
will buy another if it ever wears out
plays well and keeps in tune
09 strings without additional hardware
nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated
is it easier than soldering
the tone is bright and snappy
powered usb hub in between
i like that its adjustable to various heights
im looking forward to learning more about this pedal
14 phone f  stereo 14 phone m
does not stay in place well
thumb to little finger i can barely reach an octave on piano
solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise
i liked how solid it was
certainly superior to the old school bandbased jobs from yesteryear
i love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings
it fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes
but to my luck i found out what the problem was
nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great
these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles
they are clean of any electrical noise
the accuracy is as good or better than any ive used
i may order another if this one performs well
if youre not using a pedal board these are just what you need
i dont want anything else
they were buttersmooth and great for flat picking
if you need a simple normallength strap this should work fine
it is not variable speed
i really wanted sure sm588217s but the budget did not allow it
no way this thing cost lest than 40
good price for an pack of pickups
to my ears it sounds quite good
these seem very well made
unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging
they normally go dead in a week or less
other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems
always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases
it is solid yet flexible in height and angle
the top portion that rests on a table surface is about 14 inch think
having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation
both stands showed up in good and working condition
i purchased these picks because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band
but thats been my overall experience with digitech stuff for a long time
a real workhorse for sure
i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again
we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating
you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often
just a great chorus with not much to tweak
i like it enough that i bought another one
friend loved it very much
but for me these work just fine
each one different in it on right
i play professionaly and this is the best thing ive gotten in two years
after a time the pinch is bit much
3 downloaded the 650 mb zipped installer
i didnt hammer the strings just played easy mostly the eagles
i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good
can be fixed with some oil
especially for the price range
for anyone who plays acoustic guitar  these things are so handy
nothing more to say but it said i needed 1 more word
one is for my ibanez ak75g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly
i recommend messing with it quite a while
you really cant go wrong
seems like it works just as described
this mini telescoping boom is the bomb
highly recommend the classic rock  5 stars
im glad i bought it
sixth you can add an sd card not included to expand the memory substantially
so i say go for it
also works to cut ukulele strings
each adjusted to and held its guitar securely
the price on amazon is awesome
this is what all distortion pedals are judged by
i didnt like the ac adaptor
if i lost it i would definitely get another just like it
the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well
some are very dull looking
my son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings
the snark sn1 is small accurate and easy to use
second its 15 watts and is pretty darn loud
update  the software works well  is very useful
this tabletop mic stand works
b205d is a powerful speaker system
perfect for my home studio holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard
people ask is it loud enough to gig with
it actually really surpassed my expectations however
this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box
its a solid pedal that gets it done
i gig and record with these
vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular
just put these on my martin dcx1e and they sound great
can set different pitch than a4404
24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain
but it does its job
the color advertised was not the one i received
im told it sounds better now
sound great play great keeping their tune
im going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light
ive seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more
it turned my partscaster into a blues making machine
i bought three more after trying the first one
it is fully adjustable allowing for all body types
moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward
i bought my dad one too
after extensive research and listening i decided on the maudio bx5a deluxe
now im not a professional but this is just my opinion
i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away
it is not so long as i thought
the tuning pegs gears were stiff and a bit hard to turn
i just sort of dealt with it
additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar
you really cant go wrong with this capo
i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio
since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand
best money i ever spent
i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats
matin coated are good too
dont know what it is but i love the sound of these strings placebo
btw  12axt and ecc83 are the same tube
i thought they were crazy
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
the box is a solid cast metal box with a very heavy metal base
but i had wire snips from my jewelry kit available
these the dunlop primetones felt picks metal picks etc
just put in a 9v battery and it works right away
you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time
easy to withdraw and replace picks
i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner
one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself
im happy with the tascam us 100
this stand is useful for small instruments
why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job
another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal
never really had to mess much with this item
i also heard about the wonderful warranty that monster has
100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist
and yes its still in one piece
i always have a set in each case
any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive
the digitech bad monkey is one such example
just as the others have said
if you fingerpick this is your amp
perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms
also these picks have a noslip grip
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
i am extremely pleased with this amp
i started getting nice compliments about the guitar
if looking for that oriental sound this is it
i had a boss rc3 looperit involved too much bending over for me
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
ive bought an additional two since my initial purchase
by far the best distortion pedal out there
this device works well but sound is far from perfect
the hue control gently affects the tone
the pics also shed easily making your instrument dusty in no time
use for both reference with a gnx4 and guitar and easy listening
i use it on my acoustic and electric guitars
you must use a 9v transformer which is not included
second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy
it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too
i really wanted this to work but it doesnt
i have the snark 2 but read that this was the best so far
i reattached the item and added a windscreen
there is a white stripe running around the outer edge
should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it
i strayed briefly on a fender smart capo
they have all the features and versatility youll ever need
the capo is pretty good
i suspect most folks are in the same position
they are good to go
yes one side in my test sounded better i felt
in the mix it was more subtle
but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable
i also tried the bugera v22 all tube amp at the same guitar center
my ipad lives on this thing
i recommend this mic for vocals
the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies
but its a nice cable
this tool has high marks for one reason  it works
i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc
the wound strings also seem quite stable
i am very happy with the guitar
this is the second clip on tuner i have bought
im super happy with my joyo pedals
just a little cheaper in cost perhaps
this is a great bag regardless of cost
this is the best pricevalue purchase ive made in a long time
took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings
i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch
it is also small which i appreciate
if not then the fishman is more your speed
ive plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too
holy buckets of tone batman
that way i can shuffle through the presets with one stomp
i was also hoping that it played well
theyve come out with the sn8 i hear which ill buy soon
they sound  feel great
it is a guitar stand
its no gibson but it is a lp
small enough to take along
this is a simple elegant strap that inspires envy
for this kind of money you cant really go wrong
also the blue led is very bright
looks great on any guitar
great case didnt really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about
fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time
holds the guitar out at a safe distance
i use this on all my guitars
snug fit for my mic
very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue
then i tried the digitech rv7
spend a little extra on another brand
im not complaining i just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups
this strap looks better in person than on the computer
costs a little extra but well worth that price
the dr600 was my first behringer pedal
i like them and so does my music teacher
in summary its ready to be used right out of the box
i bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp
now i will be checking all of them for sure
when this showed up in a cable search on amazon i jumped on it
now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these
many great features including an onthefly samplerlooper
i wouldnt trust this strap without a strap lock
these are fine but didnt fit well but they are a quality product
the display is nice and bright as well
puts out pretty good power for a little 5w
these will be my mainstay
works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely
for the price you can not beat these
i used this and the color became rich and less dry
this was a great addition to our studio here at
its easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well
try the underappreciated md2 mega distortion or the excellent joyo ultimate drive
you cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal
this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards
this one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be
i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better
spend more money get some quality mics
luckily i bought the three pack
this model has the cedar top
be advised the low e string is thick
34hey can we get blue turned down a little
this guitar sounds even better
these picks are bigger than i expected
ive been stringing my guitars with daddario for several years
swivel head for ease of viewing the screen
make sure thingie outputs at least500 ma if you can
the guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it
i do not know if it will fit other guitars
fortunately i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve
it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker
i think it would do fine in a live setting as well
it may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys
it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend
it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for
i like the extra heavy picks
these are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables
are you guys really hearing anything
but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for
love the sealed bags to keep the air tight seal
i love my teles but i cant stand fender strings
silent tuning so on stage its almost a must
but my aggravations are really small ones
most small tube amps dont have built in effects
i have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetishcom which works well
plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap
im pretty happy with this one right now
the right pick is a personal preference
turned it down and the sound got much better
the light works really well and that was what i was looking for
im very happy with it and will buy more as i need more
a good buy well worth the price
summary if you need a preamp buy this one
i am usually oneto read directions thoroughly but not this time
the daddario exl110bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great
ive used these for years
it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe
like a perfect marshall but with more organicness
i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another
they have a really nice sound and dont cost an arm and a leg
the jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime
this particular one is just ok
for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well
huge time saver and works as promised
i prefer the more precise and wider scale 1 readout of the snark
the battery drains like a mf
it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable
holds my acoustic 6 string great
being able to angle the unit is great
i just received these tuning machines today
in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have
other than the radio part
i wasnt planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar
cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me
stick to nickel and you will be glad you did
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage
a good polish cloth is a must
i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom
it works great not much i can say beyond that
most of my pedals are 20 to 30 ma
so the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight grayblack
i doubt that the 200 stuff is much better
nice mic to record acoustical instruments
now this is one great piece of kit
there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport
ive owned this mic for 2 years if youre curious about durability
i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed
i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck
these picks work well and look as pictured
bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding
long time shubb user but decided to try something different
job only took about 15 minutes
it fits my mxl mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem
seems to take a few bangs without problems
it sounds just like i hear on tv and it sounds great
as for build quality my h2 is like new after almost 18 months use
i mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do
been using these for years
it is very sturdy and stable
nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price
is it equivalent to a boss dynacomp visual sound or keeley compressor
its portable and runs on 4aa batteries
this pedal is remarkable for useful tones
even the acoustic sound is majestic
still evaluating how that will work for me
fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one
but its not a distortion pedal its just an overdrive
i am sure i received a new case
this is one of the quietest mixers ive ever used
small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play
i really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality
pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings
you cant easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues
what else can be said about them theyre good picks
play with the round side for a fat tone
i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan
i thought they were all great
if fender solved that it would be perfect
this can be used to  semi  record music too
if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this aint it
came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd
they are quick to release and adjust and fit very well
this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging
exps make my guitar sound like it should
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
so i sent them back
and it sounds great too even better than their wellregarded snowball series
i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays
changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better
darn i meant to test before this review
i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist
bass tones response and resonance are superior to my ear
i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since
the pictures are uploaded on this product page
great picks would buy em again
consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision
although this plays well i was disappointed with the workmanship
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
i have a small 714 hat size too
ive had no problem with this guitar stand
ive used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d18 for several years
i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one
i could immediatly tell the difference in both feel  sound
its a nice little tuner and my guitar is sounding great
my favorite pick out of this bunch was  the dunlop jazz 3 pick
the colours help with organization
i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul
it works but the levels are too low
would buy these again ifwhen i acquire new guitars
i really couldnt find anything wrong  with it
i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price
i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end
nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch
is a great way to change the sound of your guitar
2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly
do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this
for instance the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright
this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for
the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport
they work just as well as the more expensive ones i have used
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
and in that regard these are excellent strings
they have a brassy sound to them
these strings have made me a daddario customer for life
love the bright light gauge sound and playability
i seem to like them all
if it doesnt sound good then i try something else
snark has a good tuner for low price
works well with polish on natural wood instruments
i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one
and i agree and i add to that total
it is my tuner of choice right now
you cant go wrong here
the strings came very quickly and are of very good quality
cant go wrong with this one
bass into one channel ipod into another headphones out
so i have to give these three stars overall
just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar
in short   its a winner
the old one had a lot of handling noise
its a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive
i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews
leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes
they have a long cord and ill talk more about it later
id prefer a better stand however i question its existence
however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price
with these i found myself overshifting both high and low
after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase
purchased this for my son to use on his guitars
there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things
sturdy enough well priced and simple to use
my wife uses on her 6string acoustic and electric guitars
not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie
the leather itself isnt a bad quality but its not the finest
no this is not the same as actually being loud
small piece of adhesive tape on the back
ive already returned the tuner
doubt it works at all
its a pretty cool little gizmo
they dont need any string cleaners either
arrived as promised in a frustration free packing
great for the dedicated guitar player
cut them to size and stuff them in
im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard
this is an awesome amp
there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time
great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it
one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp
amazing strings they last longer feel better on the bends than any other
now i just need to get used to playing with 5 strings
the product arrived within 23 days i couldnt believe how fast it got here
i received exactly what i purchased and works as it should
is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue
i found that quality nice when dealing with
they now ship without the clips
purchased for hanging two rockband pseudo guitars
a mono mic jack no other inputs
if thats not a problem definitely worth the price
when im in a apt
this one is much better although not quite as portable
and for its price outstanding
us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings
maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit
i bought the abalone ones because they look cool
i considered a few different brands and even other line 6 pod models
these and the extra lights are great strings
but ive confirmed i like heavier gauges
both are going to be used for years
i would recommend to anyone
it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them
but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster
there isnt much to say about this product except it works as advertised
i do like this set of speakers
i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage
my hartke 410vx cabinet was designed by an idiot
dont know what the delay was but it took forever to get here
it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning
i have not used them for a regular guitar
this worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet
fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube
but thats an 80 custom shop pedal from mxr
this is a great item
this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm
little did i realize how good this one really is
i believe some people call it 34pixie dust34
i was expecting it to be a little stiffer but im glad it isnt
several other combinations are excellent too
you guessed it  distortion
ive heard the boss verbs
hence my purchase of these felt picks
no brainer built to last and the carrying case its outstanding
so we kind of wove it above some and under others
my budget must be tripled at least
i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
my challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room
this is just what it looks like  a very economical strap
cant say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design
they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings
i have nothing to compare these too except my lee oskar
it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop
i used to buy leather straps but not any more
call me a snob but i wanted these to match my fender stratocaster
i have always found their quality to be very good for the price
let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel
this gets the track started before it clears it
its a beautful guitar and and im loving it
im impressed with these exp16 guitar strings
it works and i like
stick to known brandslike shure ev at etc
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
2 the bass cut and presence boost are convenient
ps  i have the russian variant
a rat is a rat whether theyre coming from china or the usa
this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build
i bought 2 to try them out and i intend on buying more
windows 7 install worked fine
i would recommend this to anyone
something you might want to think about before getting one of these
i am 66 years old and have been playing guitar for over fifty years
i think i payed like 8 for it so whatever
the quality is great price is right and delivered on time
so i got these and they are awesome
folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal
i am very happy with my purchase
i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains
if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it
i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good
the j53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks
i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do
its called train your people
of course i just got it
then i stumbled on this cherub pickup
in a church setting this is obviously not an option
i had the ones that came with my strat which i believe are schallers
this system does not fail
i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player
here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller 1 bulky
i am very pleased with the quality of this stand
attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product
the eq effect just kills the pedal for me
i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros
definitely worth the price you pay
overall this is a definite buy
and these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply
not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand
snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down
you will not be disappointed in this product
this little 12inch model is highpitched but has that trashy wuhan sound
while the product is everything it said it would be
if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did
this capo fits so easily
thick non scratch foam is a plus
i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar
i have not noticed any sound degradation from using it
virtually invisible from the front of the guitar
shoulder strap works just fine
the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster
does a shock mount make a difference in sound
ive bought much more expensive cable that didnt have the quality of these
so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly
just to confirm several other reviews  these hangers are really nice
this discipline once a habit is good enough
it handles these without noticeable signal loss
its cheap and easy to use
this is a great pick
the joyo ultimate overdrive is simply a great pedal
you get either room or hall
its so stinking small and thats what counts
if youre just wanting a toy go for it
these clips are 116 in
works good w ableton livedislikes  drum pads
besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me
my son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford
in my humble opinion cotton twill is totally the way to go
none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string
even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar
provides everything i need from a mic stand
however as simple as it is it is definitely a useful tool
its a loud 15 watts
i play lead and rhythm
less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp
there are other wonderful strings fremont flouros worths etc
i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box
i play and practice a lot and i abuse strings
i recommend this mixer for your home studio
they are flexible but not flimsy
i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate
it pretty much takes over your entire sound system
for the price however you should not expect any better
that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp
this pick holder works for me
60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups
still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed
for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these daddario strings
hopefully there wont be long term issues
i was very impressed by this little guitar
i am a tech as well as a guitar player
i have been using these strings for 7 years
this beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my martin
the dr07mkii has worked well for over 100 classes recorded
its a cheap box that works
but 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck
got this short cord to go from amp to waa
it is portable folds up easily for storage
i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings
top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable
is sturdy and good for price
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
i bet more than a few of these quietly show up in nashville studios
purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home
if used with an amp maybe
these picks are really hard and last forever
other than that its a good deal for the price
does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units ive used
about as sturdy as a tripod can be
no sharp points to damage the guitar
for a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat
thats a huge range for any tuner
i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money
what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings
there isnt any and it does not color your tone one bit
add the limited lifetime warranty and gibson support and this guitar cant be beat
guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic
my more recent snarks are still running on original batteries
like it even if its a bit long for use at home
does what it was intended to do
i like the speaker on this amp
thats another amp i was considering
cant miss dealing like that
i notice mixed reviews here
you may be careful around it but its hard to say for others nearby
so no hope of expanding
it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp
awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life
the package includes a black nylon gig bag
whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future
almost didnt know what it was because of this
the draw back is the battery installation
had to return the first one
this is a good buy
i bought it during the black friday sale
just use a smartphone to record stuff
this is not a toy  a great addition to your mouth harp collection
trust me your money is best spent elsewhere
these are my goto strings
definitely glad i bought this
as i indicated i have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol
the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel
i really like the idea of a 34pick34 pocket in the strap
i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo
i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for 80
i always use martin on any acoustic
but it sounds great when your recording songs
i would highly recommend it
the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking
capacitor are a nice generalized  choice
even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results
i didnt expect much considering the price
fits my behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine
have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have
it may even give you aids
the fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing
the input and output connectors are excellent
the h4n is a great versatile field recorder
i  fits well in my hand and is well balanced
and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own
very glad i bought the  planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter
overall great buy for a cheap little money saver
a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less
it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost
im not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby
in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale
because they feel good against your fingers
they are half the size of a regular pick
i finally ended up getting the tascam dr07 which i am very happy with
the flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked
this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves
they mate perfectly with 14 receptacles on guitars and amps
they are a fantastic mic great quality and construction
i rate it five out of five stars
it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up
i would buy it again
i use this for working on my guitars mainly
so easy to tune with it
i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by
im just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool
i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway
i love the ej16 light gauge for their size and ease of use
sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother
had no problems with this cable though
i am very careful how i adjust and have had no problems
i does the job that i wanted it for
so it is an amazing critic for us beginners
that said i lovebehringer products that i own
this capo is small looks good and works very well
this is a great product that does what it says
overall great deal for the price
regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing
its as well made as most i think
recommended if your budget is limited
although i should have just got the universal instrument tuner
it is so durable filled with options
he thought the guitar cost 300 above
ive owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk
sooooo everything i said initially is still true
see my previous evaluation on a similar product
but the width makes it feel better till its 34brokenin34
easy to use and accurate
theres a nicelycompartmentalized carrying case
only thing make sure you read the description well
i bought these for my new strat
this pedal is great only a couple notes i should make about it
but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica
a word to best describe it
the pick pack contains 24 picks
i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster
almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost
most modern devices will do just fine
it does exactly what it says it does
here is the gorgeous tone i had missed
ill be buying another one of these
they sound awesome on my acoustic
you cant go wrong here
dont be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better
it does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant to
jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow
the microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand
doesnt say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned
yeah theyre more expensive but theyre worth it
this is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp
i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either
i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display
and they look professional too
anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing
this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound
they would look great on a either a strat or tele
these strings sound great plug and unplugged
update now working got my mate an aussie genius to have a look
it is wide and has leather ends
you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher
it gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs
then come the newbiesa few models from mxl etc etc
21234 width worked well for me compared to the 434 version
i bought a 34like new34 product describing faded or damaged packaging
heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be
but ill be going to coated strings next
almost a gold but not quite
the strings were easy to work with on installation
these are the strings for takamine guitars
feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise
i just really like the look feel and features of this smart design
since they swivel my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks
theyre 2 days on and sound fantastic already
btw i am a verified purchaser just cant say enough good about this cable
if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure
every strap is a levys
its strong and durable and well designed
they are easy to install
i should have researched this a little bit more
if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again
playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever
this is one of them
i bought this becausehey a wireless mic for 13
it looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands
perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart
weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down
but with the string and bone upgrades i cant imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic
this is a fantastic product that is well made
they are very smooth and warm and magical like a mythical unicorn
i recommend this capo to anyone
the display is bright and clear
the plastic tension section just snapped off
these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price
i cant recommend these enough
these cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else monster cable
there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar
but it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum
i hope this helps your decision
anyway the pickup sounds very nice and im happy
you can always remove more material but you cant put it back on
my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings
the title says it all
by that time half the youtube video was over
it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold
this pedal works like a charm
great stand for managing multiple guitars
all joking aside these heads really are great
wish it was better made
eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasnt expensive
it was like a dry erase pad
great product  well made  worth every penny
they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought
works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg
i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward
to get those flawless professional sounds
a great product no matter what gauge string you choose
i have several behringer pedals and other behringer equipment
this mike is a great way to start recording at home
the colors punch out nice and will1
a simple device yet so useful
the only problem in my household is
pretty much defends its self from the old 7080s songs
i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though
sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars
i havent banged it around but have had no problems with durability
the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life
even from some big makers
did you think you could fool all of us out here
i buy this cable for my dj system and work great
there is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too
this brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings
ill take ernies over martins but not over daddarios on my guitars though
highly recommended by this writer
built very sturdy with metal and not plastic
its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it
someone will appreciate it but not me
this strap was great i was glad to find this well made wide strap
i like the ej 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar
i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i didnt
i guess they think you need big think strings to produce volume
doesnt suck tone cables are sturdy and they sound great
dont like that its difficult to change the tube
plays sounds feels and looks great
ive been sad ever since
they are certainly worth having
these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work
having said that i dont like them as much as a regular nylon pick
this cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use
rich but not too over powering
they dont wear down as easily as delrin tortex or some other materials
ive used it a few times but dont see the benefit
it alows you to fine tune each string
and it works darn well in a quiet environment too
its fine for the price
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand
it was like there was no pick
these may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length
definitely got what i wanted
you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volumewah pedals
they caused me to go out and buy another amp
that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does
taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers
the arms are adjustable  stay where you put them
cant complain about a price like this
rest assured ive voted with my feet
so far they are holding their tone and brightness
this is a nice leather mandolin strap
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
at this price these cables are a bargain
keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks
this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar
no guitar effects or drum patterns like bosss br micro 4 and 80
the guitar picks were exactly what i was looking for
the first is that the finish is not as good
it also powers everything else and looks fine doing it
these picks sound good and have lasted well
ive purchased many snark tuners
one constant high pitched screeching tone
the plastic is solid but not unbreakable
i just put theplanet waves pwct12 ns mini headstock tuneron my stratocaster last night
this product has a monomicrophone input and a stereo headphone output
i needed nylon core strings
i plugged in my martin hd28 and all went well
i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews
just give it a little thought
i love the freedom the g30 gives me
generally dampits can be used over and over for years
mine is modified with the monte allums trigain rectifier modification and its absolutely killer
my loyalty is certainly not shaken
storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks
great tool and good quality product
its also very easy to install
the 65 twin reverb on the orange level is by far my favorite
they dont break either although they do wear down over time
im neutral on this one
the price seems fair enough
a 2 item cost 1770 for shipping
you can also do this with all the other channels too
the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates
its ready to gojust plug it into your laptop and start recording
banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice
even at that i consider it a good buy
if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it
they are used by other artists that approve of them
easy to use very accurate highly recommended
its very inexpensive needs a little work sounds very good
however there is a downside
and it does make some noise in my chain
they are definitely more comfortable
enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
for the money you cannot even make your own
the quality of these guides is not what i expected
i found this one to be made well enough that it plays well
read my review on those though
well i was dead wrong
i will use these for my lower end stuff i will probably sell anyway
i really like epiphone products
sticks are well organized and always in reach
pricey as far as strings go
i love this thing love it love it
but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka
after a little break in these brought some new life back into my amp
i normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar
the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage
any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it
this amp would sell for double the price tag
as far as a cv controler
if you like being in tune this is probably for you
the a string too doesnt project as much as the standard strings
i forgot how dim led lights are
how much can you say about a patch cable
this is a great invention
its really not a 200w system
first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express
fast and reliable and accurate
also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little
i hate minimum word review requirements
i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons
are my behringer eurolive active pa speakers as good as my mackie srm450 speakers
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty
these are great did the job
for the cost these are a smoking deal
if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it
allinall its a good strap for the money which wasnt much
i have to admit my own vocals arent perfect
this is a great product for a beginer
i dont use them all too often because theyre a bit too stiff though
i lose picks so easily i needed a pick hold
but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem
maybe it is built better
the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud
so far this cable has worked very well
the mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance
this item does the job
the 12pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity
i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome
so far that was an ok decision
doesnt have the same feel either
i got it earlier then expected and i love it
it holds your guitar up
the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping
glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on
i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp
small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners
this unit is of high quality though
i have enjoyed my protec strap
im satisfied with these picks
add in some delay and it will give you an organtype swell
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
perhaps i didnt take the time
besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years
send them back until you get a perfect set
its really overboard in a way that i didnt find musical
i actually bought three of them
each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky
i will buy another in a second color
in fact it may be overkill
it has excellent bass and treble tuners
this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused
this is my favorite light weight guitar stand simple and does the job
sometimes i find it a bit too long but i dont mind
first some clarification is needed on 34tube34 vs
u wont be happy either
i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly
not much of a chore
it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right
but this case fits my dot like a glove
it was inexpensive and fun to use
sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work
this works in some applications but doesnt work in many others
there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob
im not a fenfer fan but i really love this tuner
i use sound studio but the included free softwareaudacityworks practically as well
i store my picks in there and i put it by my table
do not use these to polish your guitar
just remember that this model is for standard type axes strats teles and such
it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name
overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals
as far as the vintage tones go
nice cable could be a little heavier
those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work
stays in place and cannot slip out
the velcro seems to be of decent quality too
but they are kind of a pain
at first i thought it was the noise suppressor
now i know i would love a better one like a fishman
all adjustments keep position well
this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well
stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock ping tuners
it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
delay  flanger phaser  tremolo  pitch shifter
they work better than tuners costing ten times as much
great bang for the buck clone of a tech 21 gt2
does the job for now
the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful
the bag is well padded and i cant believe the price
i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldnt really tell that much
again though not that big a deal to fix if its not
the tone feel and bend is whats important
in 40 years i have had every kind of capo out there
but atleast for me it does the job and does it well
all youll need to get your pedal train wired and running
seems like spring is a bit too strong
it looks really good almost like an ornament
for live performance this thing would be perfect
unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem
hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands
34 anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price
i have amps that have this feature that due a better job
a very well built great sounding guitar
and yes i double checked the packaging to ensure i was shipped large
they arent bone brass wood pearl dont expect them to be
what more can i say
i just cannot get any octave sounds idk am i missing something
which never picked up the phone
spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat
for the price this is a pretty nice strap
you disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods
perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets
your strings will thank you
my son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more
but they really dont do all that great a job
what can i really say
i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer
es el output original de fender
but give behringer credit for providing a manual
this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours
and out of all of them i like the snark the best
i bought these primarily because they are so cheap
power adapters are your friend
this is the best mic for its quality and its price
but then again i didnt have to buy these
when these slip away ill order more
the planet waves capo trumps mykyserin both speed and ease of use
this may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventually
this tuner did just fine with the low b on a 5 string bass
i just dont care for them
i love the elixir strings
49 for a 199 microphone at amazon
now rocking and basic recording its how its supposse to be
needed these accessories to match a brand new fender pick guard
its just a perfect standard wah
itll protect your mando just fine
combine that with the great product design and im a happy customer
long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time
some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho
obviouslyin my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs
i still use this for practice at home
an hour after its applied it sets up and doesnt get on your hands
i have all the volume i need and great tone
the martins are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball
now off to buy some different bridge materials
not a lot to say about it really
the more aggressive recording level solved that problem
these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut
well its a cloth and i use it to wipe my guitar
im just learning what i want and what i need
i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit
it only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying
this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings
the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles
lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound
i like the thickness of this pick
tried rebooting a few more times still didnt work
its a bit easier to see the display
it is very reasonably priced as well
it is very precise and accurate leading you to perfect tuning every use
i immediately noticed a difference in the quality fullness and volume of my amp
i can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the gb card
but these are great for about any electric
i know some will disagree
the dunlop does not have that feature
the wahs were usable but just did not sound as good
this amp is something else
this is a good product
hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space
it does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs
ill also note that its even affordable while its brand new
its adjustable and allows me to fit a clampon microphone boom arm
they look great up on the wall
036 respectively which i can feel as well as a slightly thicker b string
didnt have to install any kind of driver
you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger
now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines
otherwise the size of the dialface the clip itself is precisely the same
i solved the battery problem by using a 1spot 8outlet pedal power supply
july 20 2012 just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat
my sons mom thought it was a toy 34its so small
just be sure to use a good quality speaker cable like the gls
a less important issue has to do with the grain
it takes some doing to figure out which does what
i was not disappointed at all
cheap case but does at least fit the guitar
they securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely
i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solidbody bass
the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less staticlike etc
it was very digital soundingat this point i wasnt sure what i wanted
great upgrade for squier telecasters
then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware
i really dont like it
hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point
it is a great pleasure to jam on it around
mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014
that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better
found a sweet spot near area 34234 on the weak instructions
its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to dawdat interface
the jam man solo is an amazing pedal
the cables are very long maybe too long if thats possible
i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs
best recomended quality and price
surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board
i really wanted to like these but theyre a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin mess
i would definitely buy this brand again
currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount
i gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully
the action is set perfectly and i dont have any issues with buzzing strings
i really and suprisingly like this little gadget
they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably
i needed a cheap mic stand that didnt break the bank
it can be confusing during the first time i used it
it is built sturdy and sounds really good
this gives me the same recording ability 9624 but it is much less expensive
youre probably also buying your strings by the box
it does twist around a bit when you handle it
then again i never mistreat my equipment
brass color lock that comes with it
has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too
i am very happy with the elixir brand strings
it connected well in the nady smpsx1 phantom power unit i bought
what can i say that you havent already read about this amazing pedal
they are all better than the line6 every one of them
treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot
used them while building a few prewired pick guards
28 coiled plug end to plug end
i got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall
i change strings every two weeks
they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time
would and will buy again and recommend
great padding yet still lightweight
the tone is much bettter too
cant ask for much more than that
it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings
others complained about this and they were right
read the description so you can have a sense of size
fast forward a few years and ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals
it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano
sorry yamaha but facts is facts
thank u joyo im your number 1 customer
the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v22 peavey valveking etc
its not always just the power supply making the noise
so i decided to get a set of strap locks
made of all metallooks and feels well made
i think it works great
it boosts the guitars signal
real good variation from full out rat like to not so much saturation
these are great for sure
talk about a false sense of security
i play guitar and stand behind the vocalists
the wire gets stressed at the mic clip andor plug and shorts out
i was not sure about this at first
i really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs
i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it
recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges
i brought this for my husband drum set
an allinone guitar tool that is a musthave for any guitar case
if you can make the software work consistently
the cable works fine and is very flexible
there is a tone circuit bypass switch that i do not fully understand
i bought this unit because my amp doesnt have reverb
this pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me
comfortable and very nice fabric
its a midlevel priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals
my first tuners battery it came with lasted over a year
if it is not convenient it wont be used
overall  i like it
that may sound badm but i am glad because its better than too small
it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville 410fender mustang floorboard combination
it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos
i paid 50 for it and it works great
intuitive and the backlit screen is so easy to see
some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdmausbinf
i hope hes right cause i love this little tuner
i also other boss distortion pedals
just a few words squier by fender
this cable is great for xlr microphones or diboxes
i use it on my taylor 910ce taylor 718e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
great product with nice feel and tone
ive even used this on matte or light finishes with good results
my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
this makes it easy to copy to my pc and keep organized
not a slam on the productthats just the nature of the beast
this bundleincluding an 8pedal chain a few adapters and the power supplydoes it all
sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can
i really enjoyed this tuner extremely fast an accurate at tracking you
the sound quality is excellent
its just a plastic clip and anything can fail
if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles
but im a big fan of allinones
the lcd screen is bigger and overall very simple to use
these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums
you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow
all in all they both are the best of all the ones ive tried
good to keep as a spare in the gig box
had no issues in the 2 months
can be quite sibilance prone so beware
second would be an fx loop
the result is quite appealing
just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise
but its a nice design and thank you to the designer
and its heavy and not stylish in my opinion
other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate
this is a pretty decent guitar
what do you expect for two dollars
its easy to read and dead on
i didnt expect this cable to be so thin
these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb dont sqeek
still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter
this thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well
but this tuner destroyed those expectations
however all you really need are the two functions and they work
since no two distortions sound the same
love this amp and ive shopped every comparable model
blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store
a good tool for study and applying to your music
im a daddario man myself but hey free is free
its confusing and i do gain or filter in my daw
it will not dry out and lasts for years
the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar wont fall off
i have two of these and i use them
the many reviews were absolutely correct
i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear
packaging is well thought out too
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
while i didnt need volume this little guy can be loud
ive written a review before
but you will get over that once you see how long they last
for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
the unit itself has held up well
it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way its supposed to
the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well
buy it you will have a ball
seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound
one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place
that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing
i like the unique pattern on this thing too
great deal from amazon   thanks
i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day
sounds great with an electric acoustic
like i stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality
5 so what does it sound like
its an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type
which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment
shipping was great along with packaging
i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china
great tuner for the price
it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings
i dont blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
ive had fun with it
it will give you a variety of bass tones
it is exactly what was described and it was a good price
these microphones have a qualityfeel to them and they all worked perfectly
im so glad my friend introduced me to this product
anyway the attack on this pick is so just
the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support
but locking tuners are not really for that purpose
its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident
much cheaper online too for the price its a steal
it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal
one cannot go without having one for the price
shame on martin for such a piss poor product
i cant get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe
this tunners turned my normal cheap squier into a perfect squier
besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars
daddario is awesome if you keep in mind that theyre on the cheaper side
now im spoiled and ive become a guitar strings snob
it doesnt color or diminish your tone in any way
ive had it for about 5 or 6 years now
been using this brand of strings since 1971ive always been pleased
this pack comes with 6 picks
you wont be performing with this guitar
updateafter using this microphone for a while i find it to be somewhat lacking
fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky
my recording playback sounds like its live
leaves no ffingerprints or smudges
it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians
so i figured what the heck
basically its a preamp that sits on the floor
while it is just a stand it seems to be sturdy and durable
but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before
im elated to know i can now get these buttons separately
053 and high e and b each increasing
you can use a capo with this instrument
thatll make it loud enough for most bars
id definitely recommend this product to a friend
no humm so that is a plus
put them on an eric johnson strat
they fit all of my gear
it has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility
this is the one pedal i cant do without
usb only provides 5vdc and phantom power usually requires 1848vdc
i like that feature alot
wish i would have known about it sooner
to have a midi in and not be able to midi syncquantize the looper
it of course uses the windows audio drivers
who said santa was a scrouge
another reason why i love this is its noise free
one minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least outofthebox
they are worth the extra cost
this product is great for using a softphone or other communications program
i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible
this is a really nice strap
the virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp
ive been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the 1980s
great for gigging remote events
the other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that
to me they didnt feel right
this is my second case from them
easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators
feels like wearing a 10 casio with a 1300 suit
the built in shock mount is definitely a plus
i love this new one
ive swapped out the tuners and have never looked back
the quality is good and they look and function well
its definitely flat and natural sounding which i like
much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
you can lock each strap button with one hand great product
it is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse
i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound
this a great cable for practicing at home
i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks
but on my washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there
erm it does what it say it would do
the guitar sounded pretty good
it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play
i can see my reflection perfectly clear
a piece of double stick tape shaped to match the pick holder is included
the photo makes them look weaker than they are
i recommend you get this
that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius
for your money i cant recommend the eq enough
i have been needing one for a long time
turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well
theyre functional durable and can be setup within just a few seconds
this pedal is really small in size has one knob  the footswitch
its been a while since last we got together
phantom power would be nice then also
this tuner is tiny and accurate
and gavemy grandson a shockblue one to go with his american flag painted uke
if comfort is not important to you then get this strap
but thats not a problem any more
i use them on all 4 of my guitars
excellence once again from tc
to me thats just freaking incredible
so when reviewers say its bright i say compared to what
the actual cable is horrible
i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners
ive tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc
they even come with a clamp for your cable
good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar
i rehearse often with this thing
nope but they sure do sound good
what about the boss me70
works as expected and should last a really really long time
alot of zoom h1 users put this over their mics
seems a tad flimsy but time will tell
the thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression i played
at first the e overtoned the b and e
it seems to work best with power chords root5th note and single notes
that being said the materials are decent
i think it would wear quickly with lots of use
cleans up your gears appearance tremendously
i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch
yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but its an amazing guitar
combined with joyos california hendrix is almost in the house
it does what it should
i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation
the way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem
made in usa a very good price
the grips come off the neck on my acousticbut works better on my electric
probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit
go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered
solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp
but thats yet to be seen
these stands are truly amazing
i needed some fretboard cleaner
not kidding dont use those in public situations
planet waves does make good products
it does the job though
the handle isnt going anywhere
my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust
its small barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back
this mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instruments
small price to pay to be in tune
no issues at all and they look good
this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing
the depth of  sound sounds great
one must grant its largely a matter of personal taste and expectation
be sure to check is the length of the arm is ok
i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value
daddario guitar strings are favourite strings
worked fine with cover off then replaced cover with new bit of rubber
i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead
ok this thing is cheap
i actually own an even dozen of these
they dont squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool
it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy
i see that some of the other reviewers disagree
this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for
it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board
interestingly this is really the only usb 20 device in this range
large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place
no buttons levers or knobs
well expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan
light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar
its really cheap and the quality is good
you dont have to worry about mixing up your strings
i am working on getting that nice way sound which ive come across somewhat
or just disappear from use
and it puts the name 34martin34 on the lowliest box guitar
this works just as stated
not noisy at all really clean pedal for your board
easy to install and remove
this is my 3rd set of cables i ordered from amazon
once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand
it was also a tight fit
the nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference
both knobs at 12 oclock toggle in middle didnt change the internal switches
however you cannot go wrong with those strings
i purchased four and they were all delivered on time
i dont use auto gain
tuned them down to a sharp b flat
because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable
i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did
its clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife
its a big step up from that one
they call these mini tuners but to me they are just right
it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt
they dont cost a lot and they work well
fast to take on and off of your guitar
it came as well packed as a brandnew guitar and looks like one
to be fair i have not tried many other vibes
i purchased this for my 10 year old daughter
i have always liked these sticks
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either
these picks have a good grip
if youre looking for some good trs cables
they have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound
i bought a second pair of these
there are better sounding strings yes
and i got a kyser 6string capo in gold and that works well
works solid looks solid and had a good price
all a at reasonable prices
they are your regular picks
unlike product photo and it doesnt match all my other gator bags
ive owned it for a while now and havent had any problems with it
this is a proven classic
does not sound good with updated equipment line 6 equipment roland units
this original plug fits the purpose perfectly
i tried this but ended up going back to tortex
i like this so much i bought 4 and going back for more
i would think it would work even better with a mic
first lets not expect 500 double 1634 sound from a portable 9v amp
cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent
i did work very well and was strong
be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly
i also have small fingers and hands
however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible
comfortable and the grip works wonders
does it get the job done
it worked great for about 46 months and then broke
nothing to complain about here
worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter
a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
the snark is the easiest and most stable to use
not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are
theres nothing else to say but to get it if you need it
these are pretty good quality tweed cables
you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time
this is so supple to the touch making playing with it a great experience
so yeah best of luck with that
this is a great stand and highly adjustable
the sound is short with a very high tone pitch
however for the price it didnt perform
it works just fine and im happy with it
i am always very careful when turning the 34head34
like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros
i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune
no dice so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots
you cant rely on the product description or packaging to answer that
i gig 12 times a month
and the price was right
sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better
my old pair of jbl studio pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
the m68 gives the jimi a good run
but it eats batteries like they were candy
i just learned last night how to coil them up
so i have to do it in the loop i guess
the bass sounds more like a real bass
you can dial in some pretty lush tones
use this for my desk mic at home
which is a common complaint and indicative of gfss crummy products in general
this bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly
i bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall
this is my second after breaking the last ones neck
im serious try it before you die
when i tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent
the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference
otherwise spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting
this is just the tuner i was looking for
ive had this cable for awhile and im not too impressed with the quality
the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture
great precise tuning with the sn2 versus the other snark versions
those work well for acoustic
the light from the leds has a blue tint to it
my washburn d30s will never leave home without one
a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar
i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal
after four more hours the a string went
but well packaged and arrived on time
fails with a 13082 googled the problem
this is a solid product
i was shocked by how well it works
at least the previous 2 i bought did
but i personally do not like how it looks of it when installed
works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument
a lot of nice features
good investment for the price
i do like these picks too
i installed them last night and could not be happier
i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter
not much to write about here but it does exactly what its supposed to
one channel 8 does 9v with 500ma sounds great right
i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions 1
far and away my favorite amp model evah
its light portable and fairly sturdy
holds the strings down perfectly too great capo
i have also found that the ernie balls break easily as well
ive had several cases and this is one of the nicest
im sure ill buy more in the future
i wouldnt recommend against this product
one of my favorite strings for my les paul
but for my purposes that is a plus
i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix
the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate
it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension
this is the one to get
padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable
should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord
the build quality is great and i know that it will last
the gold finish matches my instruments hardware and they are sturdy and durable
when you need a nononsense leather strap that is not long consider this
feels little tiny but excellent gain
i prefer a bigger pocket but aside from that i cant complain
it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable
the push button action is most convenient vs
dont enjoy them as much on acoustic
i dont play with a guitar below my waist
this pick holder is pretty awesome
so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument
with just a simple screw it comes right off
ive two of these stands
no problems with static crackling hum or other sound artifacts
i really like these things
also i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to
this works exactly as intended and is a perfect size for my ms2000
for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables
its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing
ive polished many guitars multiple times
i have no complaints about it
makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this
just got this stand today
the tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use
nice and bright so i can clearly see it on stage in the dark
play the slow 4 chords to maggot brain
the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls
wow does this stick or what
fits fine on my cheap rogue a type mandolin
ive had a few of these things not all the same model
who plays his electric guitar daily
i will stay on with the exp16 right now
definitely worth the little extra they cost
the jacks are high quality construction
great to have when friends come over to jam
it was an intellitouch that worked if not perfectly then a whole lot better
i no longer use heavier strings like i use too
441 khz and 16 bit sampling
as a dedicated nylonstring player im always looking for the holy grail of amps
i dont know a lot about guitars and strings
i also have the software version of this effect on my daw
i really dislike the switch on this thing
been giggin since the early 70s and have been hosting an openmic to boot
this stuff has been around for years
made in germanyquality musical instrumentnot a toy
and screamythe fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes
but the price is right and the stand is solid enough
overall build quality is very nice
fits either a tele or strat
sound is clear and crisp
not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about
my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use
the x3live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot
but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate
plus it was made in the usa
i was so wrong in giving it only 2 stars
i have absolutely no gripes with elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings
sturdy mic clip on a budget
at a bar youll probably need to mic it or use the included lineout
if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal
works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar
otherwise pick these up  great price and certainly gets the job done
i like it and it is small
however i had to give the tuner a try as well
very useful when restringing a guitar
but you dont really need it that much anyways
do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers
i rocked all night and loved the sound
the tone is great they8217re durable and smooth on the fingers
it looks and performs like a studio filter
this is a highly featurefull amp at this price point
and found i like the one that came with it at least as much
this is my first real recording microphone
the question was 34did it meet your expectations
it does some compression overdrive eqing notch eqing and exciteing all in one pedal
strung these up on my lp goldtop with p90s
it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful
when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue
the base for this thing is a monster
any guitarist knows how one of these works
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price
the ead are that tall capstans and the gbe are the shorter capstans
i would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars
try to turn it up and you get bad feedback
easy to reach and nice to have on hand
it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparseacousticclean backgrounds
the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it
i have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now
its not unbearable but if you can find an alternative its probably best
everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm
the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it
the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp
also known as shimmer a synth playing behind your instrument
i thought it worked good and mine was a bit dry
i bought a few years back and its still working amazing till this day
pretty simple even if youre technically challenged
i purchased this for my love of playing guitar
unfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device
second i dont like having a lot of pedals
i like the sound of this amp
heck yes it sounds that good
i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it
going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones
its light sensitive and looks professional
this is clearly a case of 34your mileage may vary
possiblyfaulty logic but i went with it at the time
easy in and out with velcro retaining strap
im really sick of these amazon substitutions
the pinstripe heads are amazing
i had zero noise level using these cords
they were great and incredibly handy
very inexpensive yet reliable cord
what more can i say
average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner
we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it
it a kyser quick change capo
that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost
heres my takepros  cheap
accurate and quick  great for between song quick tuning
recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low
it actually reclines back fairly far
overall its a great deal
its won a spot on my pedalboard and im picky
bought six still have six a week later
deep storage pocket and more
their strings produce excellent sound and are durable
makes this great and i mean great microphone even better
this amp is cool and unique
this is more common in vintage guitars though
this is a cheaply built cable
but these picks are pretty amazing
just gives you a mellow reverbish echo
but the cutters are great
it arrived quickly and was well packaged
the adjustable stand also works great and wont fall on you or anything
the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product
i always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal
kinda sucks that its not level out of the box so 4 stars
it has a nice color throw too
it can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion
these have pegs that insert
i dont get any hum and it powers what i need it to
i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics
for a normal use this is quite good
this one is the best yet
its great just like its advertised
so no comments as to its toughness
works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help
other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50150 and more
or use a nicer external power supply  the first thing id upgrade
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument
i threw  out my gibson spray
reasonable price makes it even better
they work and are fender parts
regarding sound quality my recordings have never sounded better
okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic
i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass
as you move the distortion knob higher the sounds gets more and more animal
maybe but imo these are the best sounding strings ive played with
better than going to the always overpriced guitar center
it is still a good dealtoday  if you can find one used
it works very well and is very sturdy
overpriced 15 to 2x in my opinion
these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound
awesome product to keep your axe looking great
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
he really likes it a lot
this is really a great amp for the price
strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost
that alone can cause problems
lots of folks like them but not for me
easy to use very low price classic sounds
i always seem to have to retune with the spring loaded capos
this unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some
its supposed to be 7 lbs
originally i bought another snark and liked it well enough
my musician friends notice and wish they had one
throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rockblues
btw im an average grown man 57 165  more to come
this on the other hand is not a lowquality instrument
they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive
strange for this particular usage scenario
with the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here
price with amazon prime is a good buy
the tin is way nicer than the old plastic one
this is lownoise compared to the mxr and simple to use
there should be a complete manual at least in pdf included with the product
i know it will live up to the finder name
if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub
this is a nice little pedal
is good to play rithyms but cant do pretty much nothing else
i got this china and was blown away by it
the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock
think its bucker size upgradable top and bottom didnt measure i like single coils
the snark sn8b is my favorite so far
pitch black is so cool
but do yourself a favor and spend another 25 and get something better
then i tried this recipe
the behringer reputation pulls through once again
build it to your specs and have a solid stand
but you may want the rack version for those applications
bought this distortion pedal for our son
the tones are warm and welcoming not as sharp as with other strings
love the sound and playability and durability
theres no breakin time required
it will work on pretty much any guitar
i dont plan on moving it so it works for me
see if i could improve the situation
still for the price i had to give it four stars
the tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound
not much to say here
transporting them in this case isnt
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session
no more chasing pitch for me
the sound is a bit brighter
the normalmidcut switch is part of why its a great fuzz
and its got that new guitar smell
its yellow its metal its boss
however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it
since purchasing them they still ring nicely
i would buy this again
amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do
i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather
you cant have too many adapters if you are a sound guy
but it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects
this is my 2nd hercules stand
these were a very nice find
it is fast enough to use real time during intonation practicetraining on fretless bass
but this definitely has that problem
with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar
bag was getting kind of heavy at that point
it worked but i dont use it anymore
they are also easy to do bends which i like alot
works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand
not good for palm muting
i dont find changing strings that big of a bother
i ordered this kit to see what it would do
i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips
i think the ac15c1 is actually a better blues amp
but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections
this is a beautiful shock mount
havent got to far into this thing yet but i do like it
terrific bargain for the price
i added a clip on led light as well
ill try returning it and getting the sn8
so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out
lets face it in general string winders are pretty much all the same right
the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey
but it wont hurt your back
all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared
it is heavy duty but also light
they look good and the paint lasts great for a performance space
its so light i dont notice its there
great price for 12 picks spanning from light  heavy
the design is such that they will wear well
no complaints its quiet enough and the price is right
this tuner is amazing even more so considering the price
they are larger than i expected and rather thick
but maybe that saves on battery life
it doesnt come with the cord what a surprise
update  received 6 of these
it is also very long longer than i thought
still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery
this is hands down the best delay pedal i have ever used
like most line 6 products some features are not highly apparent
if you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine
this is how basic chords relate to each other
i really dont see how gibson can make and sell these for 99
the quality of the screen is very good
it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product
but if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the tone
these slide around in my finger to much right now
i only spent 859 for this and im mad at myself
these are my favorite strings to use on my american strat
helps my guitar stay in tune
this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
i would perfectly tune the guitar with the snark and then apply the capo
the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing
this is my second one for my other guitar
install it and you never have to worry about it again
it doesnt scratch the guitar and works great
most gig bags dont come with all these storage pockets
picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly
it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts
i have other tuners but this one is the best
i wouldnt call them dull by any stretch of the imagination
to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone
work great for my needs
the product is well built easy  to use pretty straightforward
best strap locks ive ever used dunlop has always had great products
mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark
theres some good bass classical music was clear
my guitar would probably not be happy without it
the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel
i would pay this price for just the element
ive used these elixir strings for years and i would never change
this harpbb has a beautiful tone
i got the brady bunch musical here
i stink at writing drums
for home and garage entertainment is good enough
this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished
this is a great product and i highly recomend it
i have it in a 63 brown deluxe and am very good with it
this is more of a user problem than manufacturing
once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product
nice and snug with my american stage cables daddario is great
very simple to use for overdubbing
it hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised i
awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced
i dont really know if its better than other brands or not
its great in all ways but one  the rubber feet constantly fall off
comes with dual locking strap holes on each end
buy this guitar u wont be sorry you did
if you want something close on
the vibration mode is really good
depends on what you want
it picks up sound ok but not great
summaryif you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time when you restring
i would buy this again
what can else can be said
also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel 2
i got this and switched over
only complaint battery doesnt last too long
this is a really nice sturdy pedal with a really warm tone
still other strings have a rich full resonance that carries through a room
will go find real headphones thanks
this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as im concerned
but after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video i finally broke down
nice product i suggest it
it is definitely one to consider and the price is not that bad
the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke
it is a great lock and works fine but is not for me
this is such a nice bag for the price
being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild
it will tune practically anywhere   loud rooms etc
this will work fine for me i think
its a well built solid case for the price
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks
was very pleased with jp 600l pb acoustic guitar strings
it is a must to have these
fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing
how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated
elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar
i like the big size type
onoff so im not sure how you can rate them as poor
i am an acoustic guitar addict
the name says it all
no i do not work for tascam
you now have a quick release strap holder
these have a nice sound
put these on my prs se 245 and i love em
mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters
i would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many
some folks expect something different i suspect
this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar
the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tinlike
i cant imagine working without them
i have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet
this is one awesome guitar
the supplied mini usb cable fits nice and snug
well ill man up and buy something else
but the bx5 performs we well or better than i hoped
the plugs are of excellent quality also
its comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches
great at eliminating feedback in a live setting
this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy
i havent used it a lot yet but i really like it so far
minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar
it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand
but gorilla snot worked beautifully
intermittent issue indication  this is what made me choose this model
i really like the new container
they blend together beautifully when paying chords
they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking
i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better
i would recommend getting strap locks
just dont ever drop it
if the battery dies they are tone deaf
good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around
folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag
i highly recommend this petal
it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic
but it is not very good at parties
i love these hanging hercules guitar hangers
but those are mostly minor gripes
ill update as to the answers and information provided
ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3
turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when youre not playing
particularly with a clean signal aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells
its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing
made of durable nylon with pick pocket
the electronics themselves have held up admirably
overall i like the tones this pedal spits out
am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43
and the price is very affordable
34  just get one that doesnt get in your way
this is an iconic fuzz pedal
for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand
but this little baby is now my second favorite
calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red
there is no need to dl the fbv software for this
bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones
but what else can you expect from a us company like gibson
it fails to sound right
dont let the cheap price fool ya
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape
best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals
think i ordered it twice
comes with a decent hard case and sweet shock mount
the pedal is everything i expected from it
hopefully the at value cable will hold up
i dont think the actual 14 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks
all the metal parts look sturdy and durable
but works perfect for me
i would recommend for sure
010 sets and they are good too
why do they charge so much
their differences for your  ears
these sound good by that i mean they dont have any sound at all
if you dont run a 4ohm speaker you wont get all 20 watts
like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material
but for me and the way i play
also a great mike for doing voiceovers
my uke is very cozy inside
especially noticeable in the lower registers
i ordered this for my husband the musician
dont get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should
they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings
yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue
first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand
this pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture
the handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles
a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing
this one i like for my vocals live
they rock and i feel they are the best strings around today period
it also holds my water bottle with no problem
i like the jim dunlop
i have not encountered the dye running yet
i would definitely buy again
still i needed a distortion that could cover of the marshall soundlike roar jcm800
sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a
just to name a few
at around 450 for six picks these are some expensive pieces of plastic
my pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now
not cheap quality at all
dunlop univibe uv1  cool stainless steel construction
that requires a cable longer than 6 or 1 foot
it is my most used gear in my life right now
so you are getting what they say
these folks should be embarassed
i like them very much
took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye
i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts
ive been playing for 40 years
i requested this for christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it
and indeed it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching
it should be for the price
they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great
they last a long long time and are surprisingly easy to grip
for my practices and rehearsals i want to travel light
this is definitely more accurate than a persons ear while other instruments are playing
its not bad if you want a uke but its pretty small
honestly if i had it to do over i would skip this particular strap
at 25 i figured i could chance it
nope you cantd tap tempo
it hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out
couldnt go wrong for 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility
easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass
but ive used it and its easy
or they begin their rave review with for a 150 amp
it actually holds a couple of picks less
my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets
i own several acoustic  electric guitars
plenty of cord to move around with
i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal
and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use
im unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it cant be undone
the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me
shipped free as an add on item at the time
great product for the price
and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp
they were always losing their picks
although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder
i use some threadlock on them
it is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar
it comes prestrung but it is out of tune
it is identical in every way with the retail store product
these are good picks and produce a great tone
nothing like those 5 cheap straps
the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar
fits my fender well looks amazing
the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless
perfect for the garage band
a great add on to my student model for acoustic practising
im currently using the snark on my guitar
it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price
this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from
soi f you want to turn distor t offu cannot
going to pick up the optional foot switch
so i tried these and they seem to hold up better
they look as though they come from the same factory
decent quality for the price
its high quality but i didnt consider it trying to pull my shirt off
we both been playing for about 3 months
nice bright tone  and last a
big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel
i am a user of behringer products though own 2 of their amps
in comparison the shure clips are 14 in
this requires of course the addition of a 14 inch adapter plug
dont even think about it
but its really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise
it is a small thing but i dont like it
so it was something that was necessary
there is a headphone jack which is why i bought it
nice soft flexible leather and very adjustable
add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus
they do the job and are made well
the spring is tough and it holds securely
this is a nice pick holder especially for the price
built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage
this guitar is pretty good for the price
i am sending them back
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor
this product may actually be the ls10 killer
all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last
and has nice high quality chorus effect
it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop
these are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were
should be able to stand up to any use or abuse
after using the better pickup the amp doesnt have any issue yet
quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their goto house mics
univibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting
i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals
the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need
not much to say about this one
these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings
just leave the midswitch on the flat setting
but again the amp is plenty loud and fullsounding for its size
i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board
better go back to the diapason
i really like this delay
the only downside is the same as with most capos
buy them you wont be sorry
i always keep a lot of these on hand
i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box
but the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it
do you like guitar music
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
it looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes
not your fender quality strap
unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic
the factory battery lasted about 1 hour
so 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction
certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it
well they were a great investment
jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable
running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly
it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised
the strings that come with it work fine and none snapped
the bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine
it doesnt feel like quality leather to me
playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine
the sound of the ukulele is great
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new
nope no flaws noticeable to me
but not if you use such a device regularly as many homeplayers do
i bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard
this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods
think of this as an artists tool
not too tight snug but not confining
i leave them on my 12strings and one of the 6s
it is accurate and easy to use
i feel the display is an improvement  easy on the eyes
its price is attractive as well
holds sheet music as it is intended to do
when playing an electric 34bodyless34 violin that hurts the collar bone
else this is a really good choise
i have no recommendations for a volume pedal
other than that this is a great amp
ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home
its not the best strap in the world but its not bad
it is cost effective and looks good
its really hard to beat this product for the price
yeah i know touch screens are cool
they are well made and do work
have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems
but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me
this is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing
kidding aside this thing is really nice
i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy
had i gone with a more expensive model id feel locked in
note it played well the way i got it just like my stuff perfect
this delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion but a nice bit of fuzz
input has to be kept within a small range
electrified banjo mandolin or violin
this is i think based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal
you can do a search there and hear what it is capable of
this really is a great deal
the high gain channel is really fat sounding
the threads are smaller on these
prompt shipping great price great product
i bought it without hesitation
these sell for about 2025 in the real world
welldesigned and reliable i highly recommend these
i think amazon had the best price
its a really great quality stand for the price
nice solid no frills guitar strap
anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical
the footprint is small  meets are needs well
very fake cheap sounding phaser but its all i need
easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response
short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do
first the goods  sturdy leather construction just cant be beat
my typical strings are elixirs so im used to them lasting a long time
you want it come get it
so although my cleans sound good they arent great
but low quality is low quality
simply a nice assortment of picks to try
besides that the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic
because they are led the batteries last a long time
the jams improvement in avoiding feedback alone made it worth its price
besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost
have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker
its a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it
then again i dont tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as
yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers
item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed
not sure yet on the new line
what more can you ask for
why bother sending it back
this bag was nicer than i expected for the price
the g2s seem to resonate everywhere
it responds to picking very well and organically
the angle for kazoo use is fine
the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones
one last thing  youve gotta love amazon
ive used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles
then i saw this one
very sturdy stand suitable for stage use
25th i think others have mentioned problems with pylepro audios customer service
i dont think you are gonna find a better microphone
they should have put it higher up right next to the dial
i bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar
as always this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy
if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must
this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there
i would recommend this to anyone
it can range from dramatic to very subtle
these are also sturdy and look very good
i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy
what else could you ask for
personally i love the nanoweb strings
read the other reviews this is a really nice value
im amazed at how good this amp sounds
i might try it somewhere on the strap
bought to tune my bass
i use these on a deering goodtime ii and they work well
i have not had them very long but seem to do well
this is an amazing pedal
if you like acdc you would like this
shipping takes time but for the price who cares
i would recommend it to any friend and i already have
be forewarned  this pedal is gigantic in dimension
i may swamp them out fo this one
well the hunt is over
your hand floats over the frets
i will definitly look into their other products
in addition the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob
anyone needs string go for it
the overdrive is quite good
however those strings just didnt have enough bass and too much highs
its flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable
im completely satisfied with this
if you play cw look no further
overall good strings and ill probably buy them again
i use it as a pa for practicing and it is a godsend
the actual wire is under 834 long itself
it was the perfect choice
at first i almost couldnt tell a difference between having it on and off
i stuck this on her amp so she would not misplace it
i use to tune with an antique korg
i use tortex guitar pick of that thickness
gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer
its a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well
get a 10 foot and be free
this ukes sound is at least as good as a 50100 dollar uke
i have several gls cables and have zero complaints
tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice
it works on my orlando classical guitar as well
in conclusion i see no reason not to buy and install these again
its ok but not super tight
there are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that
i like this one the best
73 being my mainstays for acoustic  electric picking
are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals
and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare
everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable
the highs are very tinny
great value for the money
this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay
i had changed my strings with some new martins i got recently
1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10
good buy for the money
it now sits on my amp collecting dust
its almost like having a new guitar
for the price this product is ideal
way too small maybe like a third of the width
on the other three joyo sound pedals the opposite is true
these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not
i would expect that from an asian knockoff not from an alist gear maker
makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise
the item came quickly and as decribed
this stand does the trick beautifully
all in all its a pretty nice device expecially for the price
it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound
the straps on this fender stay put  love it
it is such cool and easy rest for the guitar
this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too
the mustang 1 was a great buy for another great fender product
ive seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz
however they tend to come untuned because theyre so susceptible to temperature and humidity
grade a cable at a very affordable price
this is a great deal for two microphone stands
rings around the hole and stripe on the back
the high midscoop mode is calling your name
some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording
i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting
this is my first tuner in a long time and im please with it
may buy one for my dad next
these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion
drop in replacement for both my mim and mia strat
but once you got it its a fine product
dont expect the fab series to be good at everything
poor on recordings unless youre looking for that
while the bx5a has a bigger tweeter separate xlr  trs jacks
also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want
mesa minirectifier amplifier mesa rectifier 2x12 cabinet with celestion v30s
it seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks
no i am not affiliated with the company at all
my curiosity didnt end there though
tue quality is very nice solid and resistible
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
these pots are cts and have a nice tight feel compared to alpha pots
best part this strap gets long long long
i have never understood why yamaha keyboards dont come with a power supply
adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone
the first 3 saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down
the jf15 was a curiosity purchase
its a bluegrey color and i didnt realize that
i tried it for ipad
the only 34fender34 ill ever be able to afford
the snark is by far my favorite
theyre also not for those with smaller heads
i wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference
he tunes it to itself
i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon
i use it on my seagull and it totally works great
its easy to install and i guess its cheap
the action is of course too high
the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too
it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall
whatever size you are looking for dunlop is the best option
looks cool but thats it
its much easier to play than the squier and it has a better sound
buy a clipon tuner too
the color is nice and bright
i am a glutton for punishment
this is one of the nicer capos ive used
i have absolutely no complaints
used this foot pedal for a and so far ive had know problems
get hot to wear in the summer
good deal as backup capos
great find well worth the purchase price
they turned out to be just right
not the fullest tone but you wouldnt expect that with extra light strings
for the moneyyou wont be disappointed
i must first state for the record i hate strap locks
works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes
they can leave skid marks on your pick guard
its been great so far
i like the spray bottle applicator
trust me on this one
if not then ill update this review if i can
you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy
applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets wipes right up
item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging
buy this with confidence  youll love it
it makes you not easy to put back the mics
but for seven bucks it gets the job done
i tried it and the quality is low end
neck and frets are straight level and do not snag
finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple
honestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune
until then thisll be a fun toy to play with
though it takes eq well and you can eq that in
as it stands i give them 45 stars
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
it worked out of the box
theyre one of my very favorite effects honestly
the same goes for tilting
its not so 34digital and bright34 delay like boss dd3 or dd7
but despite those limitations the bad monkey is awesome
go ahead and get them  youll be glad you did
its quiet and has a very active tone control
i play harp with some some that i perform
the tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place
this little product is the perfect solution
it is a simple compressor thats it
but i loves me my musicman
it either cleans or it doesnt
goes up and down and tilts back
it gets you in the ballpark but just barely
it something nice to have around your house and work great
ive used these most of my life and will continue to
it doesnt have a onoff switch but thats minor
some have two pedal effects some have 6
it feels more sturdy than the h2
the corners of the case are well reinforced
you have to actually play one to understand what im talking about
works great for podcasting vocals or anything else you want to record
these may be my new favorite bass strings
b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal
this works just as good
i use it with a fender frontman amp
play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick
the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours
second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser
i typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars
absolutely no complaintsissues at all
it will make any strat or tele build shine
its virtues are many and varied
its my go to for chromatic tuner
luckily i have no need for the clip
brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking
i no longer lose or misplace my picks
thats quite shocking considering how long the usb 20 standard has been around
by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time
i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long
this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain
and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces
add to this 16 digital presets
of course amazon is always 5 stars in my book
very playable right out of the box and very beautiful
i bought this for my teen son for christmas
no hassle with the right jacks and stuff
for metal its got great control of the distortion tone which sounds pretty good
i see they make a mahogany version i think du200
i wouldnt want it to be my everyday acoustic tone though
it was a total waste of money but doesnt pay to return it
he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings
when i got the patches they were better quality than i expected
ive tried other passive volume pedals that didnt work
one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway
the strings are slightly smaller than the j74 and deliver a great sound
the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain
the review below is wrong
worth the higher price because of the warranty
it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget
recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money
the great thing about it is the length
the stand is very well constructed and very stable
i like these nickel on my tele
what you see is what you get
im betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it
good thing i didnt trust the plastic anchors
see my review of that item for clarification
frankly id like to see a baritone version
i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy
i used this capo on a gibson j40 hummingbird and a j200
it also looks pretty damn sharp
next week ill purchase another with a different feature
can i hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones
i swear i was done in 20 minutes
two disasters for classic rock music
for the money i have no complaints
unless you just dont like daddario i would recommend these strings highly
unfortunately they sent the wrong one but ill use it anyway
simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively
fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind
it was my fault not to check out its measurements before purchase
if not this one at least buy some kind of cleanerpolish
there is enough in one bottle to last a very long time
its obviously simple to use having one knob and all
micing for larger venues would work just fine
but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong
practice time just got better for your neighbors
not only is it interferencefree it has a much warmer intimate sound
fits about 58 guitar picks or so
for the price and selection and results works for me
it is a small design amplifier and does its job very well
other than that they appear ok
its much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables
hard to find just 10 mike cords
overall i can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at
bright display easy to use works well and cheap
then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case
i would happily buy elixirs in bulk if i had faith in their shelflife
this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm57s
i probably wont buy again for my other and future guitars
would not hesitate to purchase more of them if i need to
sounds good and the action is smooth
got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin
from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed
it also has a headphone jack
the fenderschaller design covers all of these bases well
im only sorry i preordered only two sets at 1249
the 9s are super slinky just like the name says
i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap
the snark sn5 tuner for guitar bass and violin gives me spot on tuning
it is built solidly and looks roadworthy
it has performed better than i had expected
the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome
stamina mode is supposed to run for 11 hours
i am very happy with it and thank you
i have yet to try this through a loop
if not break out your philips head  tweak your intonation
looks really cool and sounds great
got this tunermetronome as a replacement for a tuneronly model
grunge was ok but not my kind of style
pluck a string and let it sit and it slowly cleans up
this one is very thick and solid like its supposed to be
that being said i have to admit that these picks are very high quality
they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning
guitar pics what more can i say
not cheap  but worth every cent
new fail update  the tremolo in this unit just stinks
i dont think it would hold up long on stage at a venue
best price and overall value compared to the name brands
outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time
there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rocksolid
the are strong durable and sound good
i dont use a long delay time in fact i dont max it out
the small size means it fits my panniers just fine
its a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations
the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package
these picks are the bomb
it wont make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony
if it only came in mink it would be perfect
they attach to the wall with 2 screws
great tool and has two different modes which is cool
you have to try it to believe it
this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down
the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion
operation is simple press once to record
im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal
at least its long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures
they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
this daddario micro ns tuner tops all those with ease
this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice
the snark is cheaper too
they hold their tones longer
same manufacturer but different models
thought about new sensor mullard ris or sovtek el84m7189s
excellent tone and im a bit surprised by that
good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts
i am using this on my martin 12string
i also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents
except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs
overall they are attractive wellmade hangars
i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else
great feel leather matches my instrument well
and no surprises works like a champ
they are great strings on any guitar
also check out hosas sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter
this is intended to replace a mim 6 screw stratocaster bridge
nice bright screen perfect and the price is right
again this material seems to be nonmarring
i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string
cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far
it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well
i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on
bass only  take it or leave it
make the sound clean and bright
i got this for my boss loop station but it doesnt work very well
i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me
the pack brings 6 picks
do you even remember why you picked the style you use
details the basic concept is good
i like that its a bit larger than a 2021 soprano uke
now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy
i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didnt work
i can take or leave the kill pot
nice natural finish all shiny and new
does all the job that i need it to perform
i would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal
the built in volume knob it a great tough
this is a good string
theres not much to say except that it get the job done very well
very nice quality inexpensive guitar strap
have several tuners of different names and quality
not i have piles and piles of picks going unused
means only that dr 40
its a fender heavy so theres not much else to say about that
my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings
overall im happy with my choice
so you can have this thing on the go
the flex is just right for me and they last forever
and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure
i love the price and they last me quite a while
what does anyone really want to know about a string winder
no buzzing and crackling and no more wires
wasnt expecting much for this price
ive never had a problem
they have been around a long time and hold up well with time
give these a try if youre looking for some new strings
i play either a martin ae thru it or a strat knockoff
good for rockabilly and 50s slap echo
this is a must have item in my opinion
it works as expected and has not given me any problems
what could possibly go wrong
tough to even strech this into a full review
it sounds really natural and its easy to dial in a nice sound
i think thats the way it really sounds
good quality accurate and not expensive
the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically
when he was done he said i love this mic
he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain
ive had mine for over a year now
product is a solid build and prices right
i have dozens of guitars
i bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price
i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up
i would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player
i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things
i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just cant compete
just got my stand today
i will also say that if you can find one used  buy it
i can tell a slight difference
it is recording my guitar beautifully
for it being pretty cheap i had to get it
once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results
still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing
best 3 ive ever spent
on my electrics i love extra light 8 gauge strings
i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it
im new to electric but my les paul does change tunes
it is pretty comfortable to wear also
i installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay and it lasts forever
okay mine has just arrived
then carefully drilled two holes per tuner
i needed picks so i ordered an assortment
i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners
great quality for the money and works well
had the battery not been an issue i would have rated this 5 stars
one for bass rolloff and one for midrange emphasis  presence boost
the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool
it cuts my signal a bit
you wont feel so bad when one falls off the stage  breaks
great quality string winder and cutter
if youre using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicely
it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise
but considering the price thats understandable
wow these are some good sounding strings
this is a cheap guitar in every way
maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on it
they arent that expensive especially as an addon and theyre relly cool
not really worth the 75  i returned mine
quality is there in construction and signal passing
this one was a good buy for the money
fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway
i had an old wallwart laying around and put it to good use
the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better
i started with the flimsy grays
not much you can say about these theyre knobs
these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners
he was not incredibly pleased with it
apparently they arent easy to make
companies that dont test their products dont deserve your business
have used it on a couple of ukuleles
i love the colors and the matte finish too
for most of us this is more than adequate
the soprano one fits great even though its a different brand
made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal
simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain
dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasnt installed
the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference
a simple delay looper will suffice
such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hds
the action is low and the guitar structure is perfect
the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus
takes a matter of moments and works great
i really appreciate the cutaway
when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked
the pickups are surprisingly good
i would also deeply recommendsnark sn2 all instrument clipon chromatic tuner
for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient
it works on steel strings
amazon has this harp marked down to about the 25 level
great way to wake up the kids
i have used the kyser spelling
got a vintage instrument you dont ever want to see hitting the floor
nothing is lacking to start playing right away
imports often have threads other than 14 inch sae
the pick pocket is handy
it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes
i love this pop filter
at first glance the different tone kits dont bring much to the table
it is small easy to read and use
its easy to forget its there
comes with a db limiter 16dbswitch right on the mic
i bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year
rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard
i use these on my hofner and gibson es135
ive got 5 effects hooked up to this thing
for being so cheap this pickup works surprisingly great
built like a tank  brushed finish  connections on the front
until i switched them around
let me first start off with the sizing
the sound quality is also very decent
makes my life easier when i pack up and set up the equipment
they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings
a little flimsier than the at but at the price its good
ive had no problems with the ones ive bought
this cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect clean sound
ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change
this not the first swing hanger i have
i dont play my martin very oftentoo busy with electrics
the price is so low you should own at least one
fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate
i unplugged the usb cable for the microphone and things went back to normal
and high praise for godps music
i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar
i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage
its easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not
i have used on all my guitars
the plastic is thick and of a nice material
hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good
is this the best digital delay on the market
this is a great pedal for price
these used to be expensive noneessentials but today theyre small accurate and portable
the fitment to the power supply is there
this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm
but seriously that little paper wouldnt kill anybody
the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins
we custom manufacture insert cables for custom soundreinforcement fixed installations
gls is great quality and durable
this is a great combination
i have a gibson les paul that i bought used
what more could you ask
this looper is serious worth every cent i spent on it
leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap
mediums do great but the thin fall right out
do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6 pop filter
im using a ts808 in front of ocd
i just cut the volume on my guitar snark senses vibrations through the neck
its small enough that you can leave it on in the case
over a simple usb headset without 34breaking the bank34
first time using item and it broke
i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio
they are still going strong
the stand arrived very quickly
when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me
so i was dieing to feel them
i just wish it had a little more 34give34 to it
daddario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time
i dont see how it could be better
you wont be disappointed on this buy
its fairy thick and the material doesnt slip around on your shoulder easily
they bend quite a bit and are very easy to use
hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning
i only use this microphone for podcasting
this thing really wants to sing to you
the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly
doubt ill use the strap
it just sounds more organic and less sterile than the boss pedal
the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest
these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise
bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything
its really an excellent pedal
and if you goof and unplug it before powering it down no problem
it sounds exactly like how i always imagined like in all those records
its sturdy reliable and to the point
i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs
you need at least 60 db of gain the spec sheet actually says 59
ive just got the shure sm58 microphone
it has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end
34  but i lost it
others may feel differently i am sure
i have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners
i also bought a lesson book for drums for myself
no frills just a simple concept that works
sell your sm57s for 60 and turn them into two of these
i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application
the second one is working fine so far
warm distortion and good controls
these are the best sounding in my book
although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction
this was exactly what i needed this being the 3rd compressor i bought
but i prefer the walker williams brand
this is a very accurate tuner
these headphones are wonderful to wear
i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly
very handy to have two picks with you at all times
received these with lightining speed
i have it as the last on my pedalboard before my gnx4
just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage
what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently
or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone
60 picks perfectly by the way
some have complained that its construction is not the best
otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back
since then ive used nothing else
i have this on a cream colored stratlike guitar and it looks great
it just sounds weird and unmusical
what to expect  with one drop the effect is immediate
constructed well works perfectly rolls up nicely with no kinks
im quite please with the xenyx 1202
well that is beyond me
this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig
011 strings are what i use
bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job
on this guitar they sound a bit too bright
also i like it more than the jj but the difference is subtle
having these nyxls on there is just one more added benefit
i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks
soothing music is part of the fix
it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick
the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on
it should just take some getting used too
these are the best celluloid shellcolored thin picks around
i think i would stick with the black color though
the plastic is pretty lightweight but it is a big help
solution  hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive
i am so happy with this amp
they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics
im using windows and i have to suggest using the asio drivers whenever possible
when i saw these things a light came on in my head
my son needed a capo expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons
takes some hand strength to open it but you dont want a weak capo
and on the downside made in china
he would definitely purchase this product again
they were the right size
yet its durable enough even for the roughest of players
bought bass case for stratwanted extra space
so far it has lived up to my expectations
daddys never let you down
there is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start
not sure which they have
they are some of the best drum sticks ive played
so why have i never tried their egit strings
individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion
thanks for such a great price amazon
if you really want a capo get a keyser or other decent capo
i like the sound and feel of these picks
i use the cm2 if i want to play dirtier and for covers
no noise and very durable
im only nitpicking so that you will know all the tradeoffs
donr be fooled by the imitations
there is a handle and a shoulder strap
this is the last one you will ever need to buy
i am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading
the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well
it does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice
this is a great tuner if you know what you are using it for
had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing
overall i am quite pleased with these
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings
replace the tremelo arm with the one offered on amazon as well
other than that the product works asadvertised
clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer
this is not a wooly splattery vintage tone like the dunlop fuzz face
prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping
if i want better i would shop around and pay more
you may wat to reconsider buying any filter
great sound and no wear after one session unlike the daddario strings
it doesnt sound exactly like an sm57 but it will get you close
i run this direct to my digital recorder
i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics
its okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new
this one is a keeper
for the price it is hard to beat
simple but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case
they are about equal on volume
we use those widethreaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall
for me this one is just right
for the more casual player these might not be the best choice
still this aint bad for the pocket change they charge
its pretty accurate on that neck up to the 4th fret
it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need
it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac30
legs hold up pretty well also
the ultimate in low tech
when they break i change em
i would recommend this and the quality is good
just gettit if u are in a budget
first the pt2 and now the pro
i bought this since i am a new guitar player
notes are pretty mixed up and not separatedclear very loud though
there is no noise or hum
pretty standard vs all other straps
ill probably get another one
this is fine as a general stickon inexpensive pick holder
at 40 you cant go wrong with these pads for you studio
who knows what real quality would cost these days
these deliver on both counts
the title says it all
good strings for my electric guitar
to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic
i own three shubbs a kyser a dunlop and one of those rolling capos
this inexpensive capo works as advertised
good luck if you buy it
i share most of the same sentiments
again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well
now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer
knobs were hard to see settings
amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too
a guitar player for 20 years now i decided to give it a try
i cant recommend them highly enough
ive had hohner racks before so i was prepared
for that application it works fine and sounds great
mostly slinkys or super slinkys
i guess as long as both are still available exl111 being phased out
there is no onoff switch this really pissed me off
but this means trial and error and a busy wallet
fair to good wood materials and furniture good design
one could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals
this saves so much time for getting strap on and off
what can i say it works
i like the ability to customize tension
how do you review an sm58
unless you dont really use boxes
other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside
well built and good adjustability
update   i just received another set of these cables
i like the 334 wide for my bass
as with other dava picks they wear out pretty quickly
considering these strings cost much more than others i certainly am disappointed in them
but the hard wedgie is the clear winner
this one appears to be an exception to that rule
these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better
its a fingerprint magnet but thats about the only gripe i have
these are the same strings i paid much more for in my store
the mic imo is fullyvalued even at its singledigit price
i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises
pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change
i purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the behringer uf0202
its an important component in my studio
this stand really isnt an exception
the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful
holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on
the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist
first it works extremely well
i had trouble with strings going out of tune too often
your guitar will be fixed surely
as soon as you press down its on
so slick and last forever compared to standard strings
that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune
these picks are kind of thin flexible and have a good rubber grip
definitely a 5 star purchase
these are for lead and not rhythm
this is essentially a toy
the other cleaners and polishes are great too
this is a well made table top stand
had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented
planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product
guitar picks make a huge part of your tone
the 2534 is wide and comfy
not too difficult to tune either
and if the mistake is due to amazons description returns are generally postagefree
this little mixer gets both of those jobs done right
a very good deal at 15 clams
ill order another set for my other chibson
unhappy with it actually i already replaced them
the octave is a joke
my only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold
does that make me a gear snob
illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
it is a fuzz pedal
id recommend to save some money and buy something above 200
i like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it
it doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either
on off switches on each
ive seen reviews about this brand being noisy
for the same reason john lennon once owned a 34sized guitar i suppose
they couldve make it a little bigger
if youve never used this stile picks you wont be sorry
the little knob on them made it very hard to install
works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well
i use both electric and acoustic
works well since i got it
but i realized that im a music snob
i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus
a very nice pick both in feel and texture
this really eliminated many subtle flaws i had with audio recording
personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal
recently i was building a telecaster project
update 232009  these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time
you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item
the speaker w 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it
i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination
paired with the zero hum ac adaptor its a highly portable amp setup
i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be
as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy
these daddarios have worn quite well and still sound excellent
these guitar picks are just the best
i dont use it all that often though
so it costs less because we dont need to use it as much
the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use
one u never have to worry about breaking them
best ive ever found so far in a tuner
good price and selection here
produce is great price and good quality
i am going to purchase another one for my guitar
fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording
not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there
i have been running it with pro tools 9 since 2011
i guess it really revolves around your personal needs
if youre boss you need the info
it has good lenght between two plugs
my fender stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag padded well too
these picks break way too easy
no problem as i bought one as a spare against emergency breakage
ive even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water
it is a very nice strap and will last years
my c5ce washburn has been a very good purchase
i just used this for a gig on monday
these are not only the best in delivering tone but theyre durable
even so would nothesitate to use that way
its not fancy but its well though out and you cant beat the value
elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price
there are different amp sounds you can get
so you cant use this as a clean boost pedal
all in all it works and i am pleased
in my experience this model is inferior
for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill
these strings are worth it
i use it for a hot rod deluxe
double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would
the are certainly ok and play fine
very forgiving on technique also
i like it works really well
i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot
the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less
it sits well on any sixstring though is not flat enough for a classical
the shielding was great as well
terrific strings for the price of cheapies
but again its way off tune
great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly 6 or more picks
i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks
the suction cup does not work
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out
for everyone else look elsewhere
ive got them on my fender strat
to me the hot plexi sounds more real closer than this
an allaround solid purchase for the low price i found on amazon
have three of these hercules hangers
these ultex are much better
so much more efficient than a floor monitor
i would recommend this to anyone
of course there are plenty of other choices for that application
its a darn guitar miracle at 40
thus i give it 3 stars
the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me
the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move
it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box
i figured he could start simpler
way more versatile than any other muff
very portable and does the job it was designed to do
this stand is small but does the job
overall i like this winder
otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it
i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes
i also use it for an older digitech pedal and works like a charm
i used the screws and it was an easy install
is that weird to say
the frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good
well built easy setup very quiet
but of course then its too loud
this power supply is unbelieveble versatile
what many people call 34bright34 brilliance is the opposite of 34dull34
i purchased this to teach myself to play a keyboard instrument
great cable for patching in and rocking out
thought id try this but theres another brand that i prefer
overdrive that wont drive you over
that said it works fine on a nonradiused ukulele
the tuners are kind of choppy
two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up
i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated
i think the amazon price is the best youll find
seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason
at 20 this bag looks like a great value
great idea great concept and great quality
i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly
like they were custom made for your guitar
now aesthetically this uke isnt as pleasing as say a martin sorpano
very pleasantly surprised buy this one
just clip it on and jam out
i dont have any problem with this stand at all
easy installation and nice natural sound
the only way to find out for sure is to experiment
this cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice
the paint fade away after a while but dont let that stop you
they arrived before the promised delivery date
a value and a half
but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls
i think ill tend to use this one a lot more than the other
but i was getting pissed because the ernies kept corroding so quickly
nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners
very low noise repairable effective strain releafthick rubber cover
might be some sort of powdercoating as well
the foam fits nicely around your ears conforming to the contours of your face
if its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds
fit very well my mic
my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications
good strings and not overly prone to corrosion
others may prefer a different sound
you get what you pay for
it tunes better than any tuner ive ever used
i had to send it back for a refund
34 all of my other cables work with my geetar
i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track
really easy to use and well built
this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price
overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3
good medium picks decent feel and sound
i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows
i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to
these look great on my guitar
i havent gotten that far yet
oh and one thing im a bit iffy about is spectraflexs lifetime warranty
sure theyre a little pricy but hey
theyre not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience
it has lasted for over a year and the battery hasnt died yet
it is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier
hands down the best cables for electric guitar
a couple tips to tuning a guitar  tune it like you play it
they sound wonderful  right out of the box
and ive certainly seen quite a few worse
i will buy these strings until the day i die
the best thing is the price is great
for the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion
finally i found a long strap for my new guitar
ive always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards
i was previously using a blue usb snowball
they work perfect and look good
i used the schallers many years ago
the best tuner for your board in my opinion
analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce
made of leather or highquality pleather so it seems builttolast
side by side the mxr won hands down
but626262it has true fender quality
they shipped quickly and didnt break the bank
i definitely will be using this seller again
these work that well and are almost undetectable from the front
5 stars on that alone
now i have it put away and im using this one
this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music
see my customersupplied photos at the top of the page for examples
45 db isnt much at all for any decent mic preamp
making you work on your technique and become a better player
for me that answer is a clear yes
this was a good purchase
these are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard
if so youve got a bargain on some great cans
it sucks at that too
this is a good item and has served me well
it has served its purpose and i use it nearly everyday
so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
i know that pick choosing is a personal matter
this is a distortion pedal
knobs and switch are sturdy
but the sound was horrible
a good cable for the money
two fender american standards gibson es335
dark grey letters on a light grey screen
glad i went with the jjs and not looking back
i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs402b mini stand
a lot of songs say capo preferred
a quick word about behringer stuff
but for my purposes with a 3gs it is a brick
but not bad and i was using a sensitive rode condenser
this is a great winder
once you start playing you dont notice it though
works well pretty straight forward
other than that this was a great investment
above all this mustang is musical
i would have much preferred a device that has a twoposition switch
this is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most
these are the best ones ive tried so far
i figured id give the drops a try
mxr is by far better then boss imho and i do love my dd3
grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard
i am looking forward to using more of the effects
i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues
chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out
i really dont like this
i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that ive had for years and years
i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they dont disappoint
xlr is a better quality than other connections
i have found the stand to be very stable
design looks great in the light too
ive been using these strings for years
im very pleased with the unit
the planet waves oports gives me that extra
the yeti has it all in one package
plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal
fender accessories 0733150406 pure nickel electric guitar strings custom are very good
running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound
i have used the exl115w set for years
and then to go out to test some more
its a versatile light source and i really like it a lot
it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet
the tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are ok
now my recordings are much more crisp
edit 10232012i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board
guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string
ive tried others   always go back to ernie balls
i highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars
this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver
i tried the rest and returned to the best
they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain
uses 9v batt or power adaptor
works perfectly with ear buds with miccontroller
all in all its a nice little capo
or play along to develop my chops
that said for the price it is an excellent product
plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker
as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value
people that say it is loud arent kidding but there are limits
i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great
great guitar but could certainly use these tuners
i tried them back to back
these cables are wellbalanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass
between these blues and the yellow im covered
the strings are some kind of cheap nylon
i purchased a power supply to go along with it
i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar
im always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs
actually much better than i expected for the price
i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings
good cable as good as any expensive brand
its just the right length for sitting on the couch strumming daily
this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply
they cost a little more than this
this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad
its long enough to allow my bass to rest at arms length
i like the light guage
i currenty use two types of capos  the kyser one and shubb capos
one for the stand and and one for a mic
easy to use with one knob
maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference i dont know
the output latency was a tiny 43 ms only
the stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended
this is a nice microphone stand
i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings
mic stands can be a hassle sometimes
to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe
product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller
easy to get on and off
the finish on it is outstanding and id like to keep it that way
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer
played for a half hour and retuned sounded better
didnt care for the behringer time machine
this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing
everything else in the other 9volt 100ma slots
ive tried a few different straplock options and these are the best
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing
unless you know what youre doing these things are too small
it has always worked well for me
i bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips
there is a gain knob
i decided to try out the powergrip and have been extremely impressed
i imagine that they will last for years
maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes
i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr
much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries
i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it
i say they sound great and are worth trying
its not for professional use
i was surprised by the size
these make my cheap 50 acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my martin
great product and extremely affordable
my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings
it is pretty good quality and durable too
i put this in a 200 guitar
imho this the must have addition to your set up
seems very solid but its always difficult to tell with cables
using it as my gain along with the joyo vintage od for lead boosts
as long as you dont drop it all the time it should be ok
it is better than my intelli 600 which i also like
i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse
overall stays in place and does its job well
this is a great tremolo pedal
never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for 20
a near miss with the ns
the size of the clipon gt1 one is also great
i cannot be sure about other brands and models
will be buying more in the future
has a very solid base
lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible
this is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player
the extralong 1300 millisecond delay is great for pink floyddavid gilmour style solos
great feel doesnt slip in sweaty fingers
i am sorry i just cant dig it
i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends
they are also very easy to use and 34install34
al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto
they do what theyre built for and are as described
for 25 bucks i dont think you can beat it
if you need some 6 cables to connect your pedals look no farther
i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin
hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings
i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics
this little recorder is absolutely amazing for its size
the color was a good match for the guitar
built well sounds good and does what youd expect
you dont have to hold it or put it on your leg
i get compliments on it
this is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times
elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my guitars
i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions
these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well
all in all not great this tiny stand
it made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar
always experimenting with my sound
most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians
the main genres i play inharmonics and sustain to spare
its heavy enough that it doesnt flex unnecessarily
all i own are mogami cables
why you would almost think i know what i am doing
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case
it sounded brilliant while it wasnt broken for about the 4 hours of runtime
i have to say this string cleaner is a must have
it has a year warranty period
i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar
and its always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions
its so easy to apply and doesnt leave any messy residue on my fingers
and note that unlike what you may read in another review they are adjustable
other then that it is all rock
i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great
i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs
only annoying thing  the case arrived locked
these take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board
the tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks
first i love these picks and used them exclusively for years
dig in and it puts out distortion play soft and it cleans up
they offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings
that could be cord issues or box issues
and i love the sound of these strings
this is a very stable comfortable seat
i have two small grips though
the 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound
this mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears
it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers
to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise
this fender is lots better then my other bag
can take some fiddling to overcome it
i used to use schaller straplocks but theyre not compatible with all straps
fits nice and provides good protection
it comes two in a package
it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too
i cannot recommend it strongly enough
stretch them bend them and they dont break
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments
this is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should
he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product
this music package by led zepplin is historical and put together well
good deal for the price
fat and deep snappy when needed
you get what you pay for
they enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought
the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f47 rc guitar
these have always been my favorite strings and ive just about tried them all
it surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all
a simple affordable instrument cable
i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around
i have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years
the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak
it is so small that it cannot hold all mics
rogue is musicians friends brand
this capo is inexpensive and works well
more mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack and less lows
to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed
i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably
this is totally different its the real thing
i sent it back without hesitation
now my gear is always ready
cant always get what you want
to hold it in place when in storage or transport
very convincing and just 40
awesome tuner really fast and responsive
these mics are very solid and i cant tell them from the real deal
i just turn the mic off
happy to have black connectors on an xlr cable that doesnt cost a ton
these stay connected but arent so wide that they change the style of picking
ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine
after im done the shine looks glassy and great
i only recommend it for something light weight
it is what i expected it to be
it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound
in particular they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars
nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops
provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars
the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy
its built like a tank
this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass
2 thumbs up and 5 stars
its like having a loose connection inside the cable
the 10 pack price is amazing
i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there
but with every positive theres usually a negative
i liked my first one so much that i am putting in another order
fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 60 amp
arguing over tuning can really take up time
works for me in fact i bought another for my classical
sounds better than the ibanez or boss models  warmer and less processedsounding
light weight compact and all in one tool what more could i ask for
to the less and also most expensive strings
i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar
the reviews on amazon helped as well along with youtube demos and guitar mags
the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also
having a dozen similara few for me and a few to sharemeets the need
they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible
you need to dedicate an fx bank now
i have the red  blinking light syndrome also
after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug
the sc1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars
i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus
when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldnt be hype
probably the best capo i have ever had
at least theres no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion
i use this on my 310 taylor with a kk pure pickup system
if that turns out to be a problem i might reconsider my review
these strings i put on my taylor ga4e
might be a little to tight for checking intonation
i love how they sound and they are built well
i guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag
this is one great piece
i would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video
there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market
it does not tell your boss to give you a raise
hes very happy with this purchase
nice grip even more so when i sweat
this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping
luckily id also picked up a package of these ernie ball strings
i love these picks they are my favorite
there is no way this is true bypass
a good price a good buy
i got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas and she loves it
honestly i wont restring my fender with them ill use the fender 250 bullets
they use it mainly to sing along with their cdsmp3s
you have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well
but i see that most are the same
in case one wasnt good enough they double it up
under 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from 2050
i like the brit setting
the uke tuner here is gloss black and the snark2 is matte red
after these strap break in though they are very soft and supple
i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap
i just play at home with friends
my playing sucks  sounds better with these strings
the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the onoff switch
the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright
not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string
better deal if you dont just buy one and have to pay single shipping
i honestly was not impressed
the effect isnt as noticeable on darker finishes though
the capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck
i bought a couple of these two years ago
makes even first tuneup easy
82 wouldnt have bought a case for most of my condensers
ive never used the metronome feature other than to check it out
the device is simple and fairly solid
they will be none the wiser
slash from guns n roses uses them
however this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion
a w e s o m e
sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti
it looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar
time to open another carlsberg cheers fender
cant beat the price either
i use them when i play with my duet and sometimes with the band
its different and just worth having to mess around with
i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole
there are others on the market to be sure
if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo
attaches firmly and does the job
if you like warm old school tones youll dig this pedal
good strings help create good sound
absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp
unquestionably the sound board was far more sensitive
i ordered black but got brown
ive tried the fishman ft1 and the tune tech ttm201
and with the lifetime guarantee you really cant go wrong here
dont buy those other picks buy these because tortex
i will be upgrading the caps
daddario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for
this is a great little amp especially for the money
that would be the top of the deal
im not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should
i was also intrigued by the 34tighter34 tuning aspect of the bars on this
a great bargain for a very sturdy useful product
fits my tenor uke and violin just fine
i use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc
someday i may use it on stage
you retune your guitar to an open tuning
of course your mileage may vary
the guitars do not sit very well in this stand
my current band does not even play that many songs
enter the joyo jf09 tremolo
preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones
this guitar is good enough for any beginners
a friend plugged it into his marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
wish i had found this stuff sooner
good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones
they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently
the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them
its thin but does the job well
if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model
new strings and scratch free
works fine and at the this price it cant be beat
the various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing
this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings
it does all that the advertisements say it will
get off the fence and buy this pedal
the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube
the unit does what it was meant to do
ever since then no buzz
endless variations in sound avaialable
overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended
i do like these strings
heavy duty base lots of adjustment if needed
it was clearly a toy and i sold it for 25 without regret
make sure you dont buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead
i needed a stand at home and this does just fine
i purchased a second one after using the first for one month
if looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further
it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether
i am pleased that they match my telecaster
picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology
i will probably pick up a white cotton strap
its made me check out other audiotechnica products
i would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose
with intensity below 50 it was usable
also great for those starting out learning an instrument
prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses
now the bad  the sound
these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used
quality work was put into this thing
so i am a happy camper i did it right
im using this footswitch to control a drum machine
this is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money
affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchase
includes screws and 1 washerfor the jack
works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room
no they do equal to my boss counterparts
they worked out just fine
ended up i picked dr07mkii for slightly less
boss dd7 beats the pants off the line 6 echo park delay
yes its made of plastic but you cant expect any more for 25
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work
i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy
i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings
this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne
have used them for months with no failures
love the case and shockmount being all inclusive
tremolo varies the volume of the sound
im planning to keep it for years
piece of cake if u practice
works as advertised but the keys are stiff
of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp
i didnt realize everything else this pedal can do
i have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so its probably fairly wellshielded
this is my second order of the 10 pack
now im stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings
i see why you pay more
it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning
definitely will buy mogami from now on
i will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board
i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program
once i read about the bugera b5 i knew i wanted one
solid construction and great sound reproduced
groove tubes were the tubes to have in the late 80s
i know people who have the marshall and the fender
these do definitely have more output
they seem more durable than other brands
it does the job it was intended to do
the instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps
pivots in 1 direction only
but for now does the trick
that proved to be true to form
ive been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far
the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended
now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise
i bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar
very very easy to install and protects
it does a nice clean job for the recording i have gotten done
and the cybertwin is gone now
that would make it easier to grab and use
he also likes the small size
you start with 8 fxsubtract effect banks for
all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on
the thing is i hate overpaying for things
i guess if anything thats been the downside to this purchase
as easy as the little round ones from snark
still i cant fault its tuning prowess
its just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables
so in that regard i prefer planet waves cables
i dont think you can go wrong with this one
i really like these strings
this is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people
i am thrilled with the starcaster
these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument
im using this as a di box for recording
pro removes friction for faster playing
i just love it now
cons  lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast
they suit my playing style well
so grab a pack and get jamming
i am very pleased with this music stand
i will buy these again for sure
very disappointed in built quality
i might have to sell one of my lexuses
its not muddy and very clear
pros  great price very loud as well as clear
it hums crackles and i think im having problems with my equipment
plenty of sound effects to mess around with
wow is what my teenage son said when he opened this on christmas morning
i am happy with this product
ive purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work
saves some money on replacements
the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but i prefer the acoustic sound
its heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo
at the most competitive price available
ive been buying these strings for a while now
its awesome to use and efficient
this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost
the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains
cant beat it for the price
the pitch shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun
this switch does work but you should look before you leap
the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones
these white nylon picks should last a lot longer
i use mine all the time between different alternative tunings
nice strap for the price
honestly the best effect it held was the phaserjet pipe effect
thats on me this is a good product for what it does
its cheap light simple and does its job
one worked the other didnt
i wish i had more of a passion to play it but
hope this helps some novices i had to learn it this way myself
one less thing to tote
not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased
this is a nice leather strap not thick but very functional and nice looking
this is a very nice guitar the finish and construction is high quality
i know its a copy of other speakeramps
i was using the bigger triangle kind before
it folds up easily and looks to be very well made
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acousticelectric guitars
i would not advise anybody to get this
it has geared tuners not friction pegs
keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential
does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music
ive used this to connect several devices and the colors help
i recommend the 7000 model
now im in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers
its built like a tank and its nice and solid
my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it
yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect
every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps
im very pleased with it
mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose
i recommend this to anyone who records at home
i will have to fabricate some protection
not sure how to rate this tube
it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward
i tried different cables with it
these are made solid and are very stable
ive switched to using the builtin compressor in my digitech bp90 instead
but he has good taste
to boot they are extremely comfortable as well
they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend
it truly makes the task many times easier
things like strings and picks are subjective
great tone sustain and flexibility
typical neck bores for tuners by brand are shown on the warmoth site at
i still own at least of each
i hope it never breaks
what a buy for the price
and respond great at any dynamic level
the knobspots are nice and the basstreble pots are notched at 12
but an arm on it and that could be a different story
i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks
i got mine through musiciansfriend for around 2 shipped
wonderful piano feel piano action
they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto
a true hidden gem thats actually cheaper than a ds1
never used this seller or site for this purpose before
weve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job
as a tuner i really like it
it may just take practice
the color is a a metallic blue almost navy
i think youll like this guitar enough to not knock it around
so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest
this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised
excellent value and you know what
such a fantastic price on this cant beat it
if not you can find a lot better head stands
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys
try daddario instead love their tuners
just dont drop one of these on you tile floor
ive been extremely impressed with all the different amp models
just remember to hold the power button to turn it off
amazing lowend output for such a small cab
i really cant find any negative about it
so i am not a newbie to playing or working on guitars
i thought it worked great for my needs
for the price it cant be beat
not sure the new set is either but time will tell
its also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use
the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera
i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop
if all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue
taylor logo makes it look good and official
i just wish more came in the pack
the leather feels a bit cheap as well
i choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me
i was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this
its a good finish but not the place to start
i had other cables on my pedal boards
the colors and lighting make it very easy to read
could not be any happier
this model is the lowest priced but youre buying a reputable brand
phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i love the snark tuners and i own several different models
the case is awesome too
the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar
so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics
i have never had any problem with any of these items
i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand
an inexpensive mode that looks and works great
the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb
they work just fine for a starter
there is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive
as long as you get one that works
if it works correctly ill update this review after doing a few recordings
easily adjustible knobs tighten easily and firmly
its a great deal buy it
and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface
classic tubescreamer tone at 14 the price
too loose and deep so i increased the setting to 3 and repeated
expansion kit from what ive seen
i compared these and other daddarios to other manufacturers
the average price now is 15 and over
i love tascam gear and have used it for nearly 30 years
these strings are very bright and full
and rockisland sound sends it out fast
replace it with another broke a product
the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier
no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc
and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweighthollowbody electric
there is no mid way on this pedal either
but at least on an initial run im glad i bought it
i play an acoustic guitar so i dont run around a lot
i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag
but the biggest con is
a very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many
this filter is awesome and for the price cant get any better
but they just keep making them
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
well packaged for shipping arrived 1 day early fair quality
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
they are comfortable to use
34youre not getting the right tone man
i am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with
he would definitely purchase this product
but only thumb picks work so i can use my fingers too
the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable
i like that one a little bit better
but something as thick as an a string
my fingers were squeeking  sticking on the strings  back of neck bad
its awkward to apply and remove quickly
very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals
i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p90 pickups
definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
i started searching around and found this product
get one youll be happy you did
then you have the backpack handles as an option as well
needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application
we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time
also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth
flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls
not worth shipping it back no big deal
this is a very very nice guitar strap
the base of this bone nut does not have a radius
what can you say about rosin
same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap
this is the godzilla of volume pedals
and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price
but im having fun and trying
you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task
like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster
no complaints on these strings
im using a fender jaguar this thing is married to it
they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good
gorgeous strapped to my sons martin acoustic guitar
both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for
it seems strong and stable
anyway i decided to change the strings because its been so long
buy one and see what i mean
best tuners you can buy
my cpu is windows 7 but it worked on my msi netbook also
the bars are easy to see and are accurate
if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get
looks good on my yamaha acoustic guitar
if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably
i would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat
sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems
it was only about 15 at amazon and worth many times that amount
one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired
cool looking pedal box to boot
it also makes the strings feel nice as well
use with power supply and not batteries
these are thick strings but still bendable just not very far
it also is a nice smooth od not too crunchy
thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasnt very happy
i bought this one for its adjustability
you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap
im not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with
this is a great guitar for the money
i have used it for years
it ends with a spin on 14 in or a standard 35mm
id describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge
my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close
that said for the price it is pretty good
just try not to get the labels wet
simple solution to a simple problem
they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool
i own the sn8 which btw is the best tuner ive ever used
i use it now to get sort of a leslie effect
i suspect that most folks will want less of this than more
so i must say im summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings
wanted to hang my guitars on the wall
the base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly
id consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 14
the top is natural cedar
awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer
my music program had no problem detecting it and using it
its not bulky which is a nice
i have a feeling this one will last a long time
but they look great work great stay in tune and are completely vintage spec
years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap
for a comparison mic i used an akg perception 420
ive had them on for a couple of weeks now playing fairly regularly
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
sonically i found them to be the same  or to my ears anyway
i always felt 100 secure with these straplocks
im using 18vdc to supply power and it deliverys a fat overdrive
had for over a year hasnt failed
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder
the build quality over the pod x3 live has improved
these head phones are a much better solution
its a tight fitting case
u wont be happy either
the pick guard looks a bit cheap but thats just nitpicking
i could use a brighter light
especially when you take off the guitar for a break
the cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well
straplocks came with black  white felt thats a nice touch
this little amp has a belt clip
newer models seem a bit beefier
i spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away
so the padding material coating could have been better made
it also helped my boyfriend decide also
the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure
my guitar was made in china which may account for the darker hue
right now it is the biggest bang for the buck
one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb
anyone who works with pa and sound equipment needs these adapters
great pedal very lush and usable tones
to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat
plus the added gag of tiny ukulele  tiny amp always draws a laugh
it was only one and it was red
thats the problem with mail order
not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out
other than that its a great device
we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices
so  online to see what defined state of the art
the epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days
i just feed the shoulder strap through the carryhandle and it works well enough
the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable
does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down
the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck
man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy
unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death
plenty loud for your bedroomofficewhatever
one of my favorite pedals of all time
still have yet to mic up a drum kit
its red when out of tune and green when in tune
it doesnt come loose or wiggle once in place
working great on my stratocaster
cfhevaluation unit provided by manufacturer
so far im very pleased with the jam
it makes my guitar look new again
is it typical of jj to have more headroom
the light is twolevel  normal and bright
idk why gc does not carry these
the lights started flashing and it got hot
daddario exp16s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used
will work on any instrument
this product does what it is designed to do very very well
60mm nylon picks as my current standard  but decided to give the lighter
over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand
you need this to get the most out of your superchamp xd amp
its working great but it does not work in stereo
other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems
made in canada seems well built and durable
i will buy these again
and why would i shop any where else
this thing has tons of gain
planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff
the quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear
it also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic
plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general
i couldnt be happier with this pedal
come on i wont bite
i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item
like the other reviewers on here im sad to report that its quite hissy
this is not a subtle pedal
handsdown i like the dunlop ones more
ive used this stand for about two years now and it held up great
solid nice sound very good quality to make anyone happy except your neighbors
honestly i cant tell them apart since i threw out the boxes
i like how it works
the audio jack on my laptop was failing
they need to improve their quality control
its made of plastic but that doesnt effect anything its pretty tough
so i uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software
here are a few of the features that i really like about it
i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply
fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet
it just holds a guitar
thats what i finally did and am still most happy with this device
if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly
and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time
i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup
i have four of these  and will continue to use this product
i have them in purple which makes them stick out
this is a great music stand
the experience for me has been pure jamming joy
this is a very well made product
it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right
aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful
break in quickly and hold their tune work for all styles of playing
this is a nice tuner that works great
it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those
for my desired application this guitar was great
these are easy to install using the instructions or without
i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast
nice features on a pedal this cheap
it sounds balanced warm and bright
with not much left i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro
these strings are quite durable and longlasting
good tuner unlucky with two lemons i guess
guessing they are lacking some shielding
i accidently bought large ooh boy is it like windshield sun reflector size
these pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material
if youre looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model
i bought a planet waves 9v power adapter to go with the honey tone
ordered these guitar picks for my son
im a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only
works very smoothly and doesnt eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners
it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument
i like the quality of the picks
i prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that
no issues in over a year
the tube screamer just works
if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice
i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage
the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length
i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly
drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly
bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo 6
been uning them for years
if your looking for the best
what im loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like
the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
they sure are portable though
when used correctly though it does its job just fine
we found nothing negative that we could say about it
this company dunlop gets it right with the mxr line
i simply couldnt get this to work most of the time
the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good
so i dont see how you can go wrong
great surprise as i never took rogue seriously
this is a very useful tuner since its small fast and pretty rugged
try finding a midi tutorial that is usable
and then  yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy
new straps seem to be easier to secure
cant b beat for the cost
the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable
i need some less expensive equipment to play on
at least it wont fall off soon
even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy
i find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber
then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation
not the best pedal out there but for the price
inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic
the monster chord is great looking but for me they are too stiff
i bought two microphones a akg d5 and sm58
not the best but for the price was a killer deal
this tuner is nice  inexpensive and very easy to use
the weight makes it more sturdy
maybe buy and inspect with the knowledge you might have to return them
i dont know if its going to last me a while
however i like to play at a substantially high volume for recording
phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine
im pretty hard on my strings
i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these
other than that i like the pockets and overall design
ill definitely be buying more of these
this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage
this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good
we can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future
it is a pleasant addition to my home guitars
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
it has a lot of power and noise behind it
i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different
this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough
and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band
it does what it should
so really i just use this for the wire cutter feature
these are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality
im glad that i bought it
a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa
works well with every pedal i tried so far
was using cheep pidmont blues harpstoys
unlike my steel string capo this uses a screwknob to tighten not spring loaded
they are correct but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle
this capo is expensive but i have never found one that works so well
a rechargeable version would be good
try it you wont be disappointed
the terms bait and switch come to my mind
almost time to order another set
i recommend them to do the job for the
09s to try on my strat and the
used it once but once was enough
this is my favorite pedal
i turn fx off and on
i plan on getting a few more of these
i immediately bought a 2nd set for my small hafler speakers
this little tuner is so easy to use and see
does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick
takes up less room on your pedal board
not as solid as the
this is a perfect strap for my guitar
do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin
i use them with azoom g1n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great
plugged it in and it powered my rode nt2 condenser mic
easier to strum sounds good to me
i have them on all my guitars
the stock tuners have one peg  these have two
it is a highquality gig bag with lots of padding
at first i used the elixir polywebs but those things broke all the time
no complaints with the crybaby
order extra to keep on hand
very similar to a ehx memory man it does it all
it is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar
im hooked to bronze strings
it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks
and they just plain feel good to use
the quality is really nice
i dont forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough
i have a significant volumegain reduction now
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better
for the money this strap is as good as any other poly strap
we did notice a scent but it didnt bother anyone
make your axe shine and look like a rockstar
that is good and seems to hold up to use
i bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with
they complement my washburns very well
great pedal and great value
i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also
if its past center the string is sharp
while it is very adjustable the intell folds flat which i really like
this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read
they sound great for my style of play equipment and setup
ducks ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case
i have a strap ordered and on the way
this instrument sells for about 100
50  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i dont use
i am happy with this product and will order some more in the future
i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar
theyre easy to install i havent had one fail on me yet
their mic stands and guitar stands
very durable and light weight
i wanted to do it through my maudio profire 610
good price too nothing to complain about
this has the most distortion
you need to view it head on
but they either sound badly are prone to electricalmechanical problems or both
its quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument
also comes with a step by stepstage by stage instruction pamphlet
just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect
what a great little gizmo
i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal
only complaint is the size which is my fault
thank you and say goodnight gracie
the snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat
it doesnt get much action my amp has a reverb
as a result i feel im  either too tall or too short
its just not as good as i expected
i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item
the only problem i had is voltage
if you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one
i am going to be finding picks in my files for years
when they work theyre absolutely great and theyre so cheap
the quality of the sound moreover isnt badproviding you can hear it
i am really liking the size of this board
the box is plastic but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate
good tone though does the trick trick
this cable is a great cable for the price
i bought this for my acoustic
ive been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010
but in no way matters
i have only used it with garage band but it works really well
i got and agreethis works better
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh
this is why i give only 3 stars because is to small for me
installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they wont do magic
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
one just cannot tell the size from the picture amazon has
i bought these to try them out
ill be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s
great variety of uses for it
why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac
id buy this again in a heartbeat
and i say duh huh really
this was a great choice and i couldnt be happier
so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help
they are clear clean cables
it also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose
ive used these and dont have any problem with them
the clear ring of the martins i normally use
but for the price this is one hell of a deal
im using these on the mandolin
time will tell if they last longer than strings 13rd the price
i recently purchased a replacement the sn8b but found it really disappointing
these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
just what id expect from the company
the system is a secure locking system
its as versatile as can be
use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape
i bought them for home use only
they are about halfsheet size
not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip
the tuner works amazing as well
cab is made of super cheap particle board
they were just what i needed
to my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar
got this because i thought the length would be enough
havent had this long but so far its just about perfect
little harder to read than i would have liked especially in sunlight
i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out
my daughters love this amp and works perfect
im a long time daddario user
im a huge fan of these strings now
i own two of these
no directions inside or on the box
these sound great and last a long time for me
this was a good purchase
and theres a reason for that it isnt
clamp it on press the power switch and then  pluck a string
this is a solid 4 depth and cozy padding around it for protection
but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done
it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar
you simply will not find a negative thing about the zt lunchbox anywhere
the quality control is so so
fourth plays nice with computers
admittedly i havent had the time to try this one out
its a short boom but it works great
dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players
this little guy does all it needs to do
but for live playing its great
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
i have three of these straps more my strats
save your money and get something better than this
i ordered this hard case for my fender t bucket
now that i have it i take the quality for granted
anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all
this is your best option for a top flight pedalboard
you get what you pay for
i also own an olympus ls10
this mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar amps
its like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends
the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily
sure enough the lining is soft and wellpadded
if youre a froosh fan like me than look no further
and possibly an envelope filter at some point
but it seems lacking to me
it came extremely well packed
thats it you arent going to move stretch or step on these cables
they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version 65
not ready to take the plunge
all in all a great capo that is well made and will last forever
i also gave it the nose test
it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea
i am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth
great value and price too
it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not
this was maybe 10 years ago
but do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon
also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isnt
nice and bright easy to see
i restrung my martin 016ny with these strings and found them to be excellent
a very 34different34 sound range than round wounds
oooops my bad when i discovered they were only 2 longer
its cheaper and works very well
for 30 there is no reason not to try it
im an abhorrent violinist but i teach mariachi band to elementary school students
i havent seen that in any amp in this price range
this may be a big issue if you dont treat your equipment carefully
ive used more than a handful of usbfirewire interfaces over the past decade
the springs in the back keep it back
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
order this with eyes closed
these are the only ones i buy now
next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing
the tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great
i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center
my suggestion  new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation
you cant go wrong with these
upon arrival i was astonished
great value and good sound
the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors
a lot of bands i have seen on the road use these straps
looks more professional and i like that
i have never had one break
the fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection
it works for guitar and bass
if you use any fingerboard treatment try this one
highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar
the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge
this is good for now
whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out
this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right
dont know if their qc has gone downhill or what
i have received many compliments on the look of it already
i bought him two different types he he liked them both
60 nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection
the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast
im super happy with my joyo pedals
it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box
so far for 200 bucks
i was able to connect it to my pc
much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer
it has done a pretty good job with many recordings especially in the field
it does not work well with a daisy chain power supply
will only need a minor setup
this is a super bag
this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound im looking for
be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however
for a cheap pedal i gave this a try
i gotta remember not to get the black ones though
spend more if you can
great for the knock around uke though
if you want to get humidity into a guitar this product is a must
i did not notice any additional string wear or damage
definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
i bought 4 and going back for more
this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for
ill update after ive had it for awhile
easy to install i used the guitars existing strap button screws
this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects
these strings are very nice and sound great
cons  so far none and i dont expect any
the back panel also has a 14 inch jack line out
but for what it is it is fantastic
worth the small price you pay
this is a brand ive come to trust
actually its loud enoucht for home
this item does not travel well and is best used at home gently
i love the luster and shine of new strings feels nice ans springy
it just makes things sound solid
so its doing double duty and going strong
thats whats most important right
however the prices for these on amazon are absurd
exactly as advertised no complaints from this user
thats it for set up
this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning
my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism
audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables
it didnt seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless
these are very nice looking guitar picks
active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely
very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings
this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand
there you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them
these strings are my second choice after the elixir 8020 bronze
are there better locks out there
i cant say what battery life is as only use withan ac adapter
i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained
i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets
if you dont mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap
they really are like a new set of strings
the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves
this product worked very well for my needs
its all comes back to our ability to make good music
the items appear as pictured
i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r16
i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume
the shorter the cable the better for studio use
plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips
otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam
i ab them both one after the other and it truly was quieter
dont let the offbrand name put you off
the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone
perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot
they are perfect for rhythm flexible
so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables
this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market
this capo seems to handle quite nicely
it is worth the money in my opinion
no more extra messy cabling
a lot of fun and meaningful
i didnt like its tone so i uninstalled it
im powering a zoom ms50g and a fulltone ocd
i could not order that arm separately
i will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases
if you play the blues
i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome
they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed
im definitely a fan of joyo products
like many here the case could be an inch bigger
it sounds incredible and at this price its unbeatable
has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way
easy to use what more could you want
the extra adapters are a nice touch
this might be the most expensivefeeling device i own
i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck
i hope you are getting the idea
on the packaging i dont like what daddario has done
cables are working really well for me
to be honest im not missing anything
appears to be well made
the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too
what more do you need
this mic has amazing quality
either way it gets you what you want
ive used these picks for years with great results
looking to buy more soon
when i buy a new guitar i get new locks
it works well with both single and doublecoil pickups
the implications of this amp are really huge
was ready to go out of the box
it is a good thing it does not cost a lot
ive bought quite a few tuners over the years
i had them shipped to my business address
i got about three of them
these daddario exl110 strings are light responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great
i replaced a set of strings that were very used with these martins
again this is with les paul humbuckers
i8217m really glad i did
use this on my taylor acousticelectric which does not have a built in tuner
lots of sounds in this unit
very light so i leave it on when i play
great strings and they last well
i recommend trying it out
in terms of the other features i cannot comment
i like the choice of colors too
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound
theres no heavy reverb there
this is usually a little more than i require when jamming
sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion
it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional
the difference is quite noticeable and good
the guitar can be placed in strings up or down
i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones
they all work fine for me
the similarlypriced fender is a fpos
but other wise this thing gets a serious twostar 34meh34
this is a heavy solid high quality mic
in my experience these cables were not great
the 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects
its no better or worse than a tripod stand at twice the cost
it saves room and makes the room look cooler
nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough
quality company great strings great price
the display colors are bright and easy to read
each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand
after trying for a couple of hours i find that it wont do that
the behringer us600 is wellmade
i can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail
the sound is great and is easy on the fingers
makes the fretboard look and feel nice
i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb
so i am not the authority
im glad i purchased this when i did
i just toss it in my gig bag and im always ready
the sound is deep and heavy which is exactly what i was looking for
great as a primary or backup cable
the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddysounding
playing went from painful to pure pleasure
its possible i have a defective one not sure
got the danelectro wall wart for it
update  been using these picks for a year since my first review
other than being a little cheaply built it works great
my previous tuner was a korg ca40 and frankly that tuner is terrible
i also have one for my bass
its subtle but its beautiful
because i wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors
i like this speaker system behringer makes good products when it comes to this
so reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding
schallers click in and you know they are ready to go
i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording
its that good for what it does
however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible
the harmonizing function can be buggy at times
i have no complaints about the construction the looks or the price
and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets
trim and easy to use
they are good and reasonably priced
very stable clamp mechanism works very well
but he loves it and i guess thats all that matters
my guitar is a gibson les paul 2008 standard plus
i do dabble with the bass but im not proficient with it
glad i chose to purchase this cable
especially on the low end
overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal
i decided to return it
that is supposed to last longer than average strings
if i needed another i would buy this type
i bought this microphone for youtubepodcasting and it does a really perfect job
i wanted mymxl 2010 multipattern studio micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it
i upgraded and would absolutely do it again
im telling you get it
affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay
check these things out you will not be disappointed
i plan on buying these for all my guitars
for an inexpensive unit this thing rules
these slow me down way to much
it fits my need for practicing
the hootenany style is sweeeet
that didnt come close to working
also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables
a friend of my has one and i just found in love with it
this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar
15 to 20 dollars then sure
it does a marshall pretty well
overall i give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars
it does very well with single coils
this is by far the best ive ever had
this has been commented on before
it tunes nicely and so far as my ear is concerned accurately
not the best not the worse strings but an improvement
no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping
and the tweeters sport silk domes
i bought this to tune my 12string without using the end jack
the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate
the national mediums i was using before had a looser fit boggle
its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit
juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh
these strings really are special
inside of the box it came with 2 screw sizes
it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic
that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp
only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad
i would recommend this product
so i dont know if its a fair representation of these pedals
first it tunes very accurately
i dont ever worry that itll tip over
48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain
this is just like any other microphone stand
it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise
you can simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel
a great investment unless you have a perfect ear
it isnt a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb les paul
i heard about these from a friend several years back
i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them
with these strap loks the strap never comes off
im no expert but these strings sound good to me
ill definitely continue to buy this brand in the future
these have been ordered for a couple of weeks
eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one
came with a great little travel bag
comes in a really nice case
cant ask for more than that
im going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it
this one is a keeper
not much of that complaint here
these are the best strings you can buy imho
however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks
this product is easy to use without any noise at all
provides good stability and displays guitar nicely
it gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone
im kind of feeling my way
i havent measured signal throughput so i cant comment on that
just a great overall tuner
works fantastic and i am very happy with it
sounds identical to my shure sm58 but much less
the korg ca1 also cost slight less
so far it has worked beautifully
the sm7 was a redesign of the sm5
i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems
on my electric guitars i dont like the look at all
i dont expect any problems
boutiqueesque is how i would characterize it
they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin
if you dont mind the heft you will be pleased
zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much
the last amplifier i purchased was a fender twin valve some years ago
great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks
she has the korg tm40 metronome
i really cant complain about anything
so for the price you really get far more than you pay for
you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig
you can move from string to string quick
but it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultraportable
the key to using this pedal is using it correctly
this is now powering my entire effects board and its doing a great job
most of them are plastic
strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player
i play my ipod through a small guitar amp
the lo contour knob doesnt increase the amount of bass produced by the amp
one could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment
great classic rock 70s tone
includes a nice hard plastic carrycase too
but a cheap item you cant use is money thrown away
had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong
i have bought three of these
wowif you need a guitar cable this is it
for the adjusting screw stand fullsizedfor 20 bucks
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand
the top part is not secured
so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd
this thing really is a puzzler
the price is fair and it serves its purpose
they just seem to sound better to my ears
it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder  adapter
can be used either sitting or standing
the case is plastic foam and clips
i am using the other 5 and they play very well
intensity range seemed less than other pedals too
but a new strap and put these on right away
i bought these when i had to retube my marshall jcm800 2203kk head
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it
the base strings feel really strange when sliding
this pedal lives up to the hype
so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables
its well made and not too expensive
the tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings
this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables
install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze
this my second hosa guitar cable
i use these on all my guitars
if you want to understand any theory start here after learning basic chords
the pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too
i ordered a couple from my guitar seller
works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars
one hinge broke after about a year of normal use
ive taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately
it is what it is and not much more
its just unbelievable how well this device holds picks
in a band mix im pretty sure it would get totally lost
you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps
open cap rub across strings a few times
the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again
this audio interface is fantastic
the apogee jam cured all of that instantly
i absolutely adore this instrument
i do not regret this purchase at all
i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands
i love the tone and the reverb for 100 is amazing
the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar
i was playing a gig at a small pub
the problem is it doesnt do both at the same time
i was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this
glad i have it only for the purpose i intended
these do very nicely for that purpose
the pick had a little more give so i dropped them less
225 at gc for example
heres a link to the extendo optionlevys leathers mmgxl25brn strap extender http www
tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over
and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included
i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review
these are mirrored by 60 userdefined profiles which are identical to the factory presets
anyway this capo works well
ill update this review after ive had some more time with it
it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also
you cant miss with this product
i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings
have had one for years
hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes
i would recommend these to anyone
i use it for podcasting purposes
i havent used the battery pack so dont know about battery life
whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord
i had previously been using the korg ga1 which is a fine basic tuner
this guitar cable is very nice
i have a heavy touch when i play the guitar
i am very pleased with the product
oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
i like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with
im pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny
so when my strings wear out i got this
made in germany  not china  these locks are fast and secure
the sound quality is amazing and its very easy to use
i move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly
it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce
this little amp is amazing
it tends to fall off quickly on low notes
pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly
ill do this to my other acoustics as time goes on
i definitely recommend this pedal
these picks are translucent purple
i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and its the same
bottom line  this is a fantastic 5star device
i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceasedbad dexterity
i was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes
bought this instead and it plain rocks
to me this was a worthless purchase
lately its become my goto tuner
great idea though and the price is right at 25 street
if needed i would buy another
i couldnt be happier with the purchase
monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end
this is the best one out there bar none
to each his own they say
im very satisfied with my purchase
others may feel differently i am sure
i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them
i decided to give the dava picks a try
nice mids and ringing highs
the main issue is the sound
i have restored an old rex commander
it does what it says it does
it feels great looks great and sounds great
this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought
it does that my dial is set at 10 oclock
anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority
awesome with my ltd vc401 with 59 and jb pickups
i love this little box
leaks a bit while using  so dont stand under it
its a decent unit but stopped working completely after about 6 months
comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer
sure its old school rock distortion
knobs work well and the stand doesnt slip
lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable
very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar
this is a problem because the sm7bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches
this is one great looking cable
i use this for my home recording studio
they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order
the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play
ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly
easy to use efficient sturdy looks nice and sounds great
easy to install these buttons on the guitar
great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin
only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer
the unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument
easy to adjust to very light on my fingers and theyre built to last
however my back was still hurting and im definitely a weakling
i just started in april after taking vocals for a year
its a very fair price and is made well
so for a player like me these are a godsend
this is ok if you are using a full boom that8217s facing the singer
not really concerned about that but its worth mentioning
if you buy the keyboard youre going to need the power adaptor
they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end
no modifications needed not even bending
for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use
i think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles
these strings really do feel and sound great
it does sound ok other than being a little bright
some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting
i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one
i would recommend purchasing it
a classic mic clip  simple inexpensive and durable enough
no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidlymounted
unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable
ive been using this product for months now and have no complaints
i have never played a string instrument
this is a standard 3824 threading tap
mine came stock with a jj tubes 12ax7
the price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner
the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me
of course its not too loud  thats the whole point
it still works but thats a design flaw
and expect to get it the price was half of what i was locally
this is your best choice
it performs as it should and appears to be quite durable
took one star off for visibility
when you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic
for the first 3 days the strings sound strange
it does not stick on to the guitar very well
ive been using these picks for 10 years theyve always been great
i would recommend them to all
their are two issues with these straplocks that i have come across
the inside of the one i received was grey fur
wide range to the tone controls
high points for the delays reverbs and mods
this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well
how does an amp just come down half price over night
i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike
i am extremely happy with this product
ive found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more
you can easily connect it to a computer windowsmac with the included usb cable
although its a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while
get it if it fills a need for you and youre broke
strong as a tiger tank
perhaps the primary dealmaker or breaker  the tiny screen and small controls
the 34strat34 is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard
the quality of the locking tuners looks great
i employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortionsoverdrives
not too thicknot too thin
available in several finishes to match your taste
forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos
i play standing up 95 of the time so these are a necessity
they improved the action considerably
i ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised
i cant handle 12 strings and the sound of 10 is terrible
im going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars
do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure
basically the value of your guitar andor the age
the resttray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments
wish the phase came in a different case
i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
treat the light like it has no bag and youll be fine
nice strap for the money
now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me
the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for
if you are an angry stomper go elsewhere
dont forget to buy strap locks you will need it
bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter
i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless
keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time
ill probably get used to it eventually
ive been playing for over 40 years
i have used these strings for years and this was a great price
if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my 1
i found the product without too much difficulty
sorta disappointed with it over all
i absolutely love these picks
i bought a set of these to try them out
ive noticed it works better with some daws than others also
all in all this is a great pedal
i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips
the behringer monitors do the job well
i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program
why would you do that boss
i dont have any complaints
works well and easier to read than many of its competitors
recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly
34 especially since its designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously
10 mm is the perfect combination
great price for good mike
i use it on my bass and havent had a problem with it yet
and got burned for it
the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright
my next one will be an sm58 but that will be awhile from now
the slightly thicker string is not bad
if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired
if youre uncomfortable dealing with eq this might not be your best bet
i havent used it much on my electrics
ive never received a bad stick from amazon
very light but sturdy and is portable
there are other brands but our reputation is at stake
make things easier and cleaner looking  thats what
i play resonator guitars open tuned
i havent jacked it up all the way
cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable
not quite perfect but a good value for the money
it does a great job
ive used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great
helps keep those ugly microphonics away and you want that big time
this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon
for this price i cant see why anyone would not like this pedal
next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected
rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off
i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week
i dont think that you would go wrong
this is a good purchase
adjusts easily nice width comfy enough for me
it is my first condenser mic and at 149 it is a steal
ive used the boss rc20 and the digitech stereo jam man
adjustments are easy to make and the fitfeel is fine
im in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play
the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall
i feel 100 secure that my guitar will not fall
i m obviously not a 34techie34
it feels very sturdy and im not worried about it cracking anytime soon
it is accurate reliable for tuning and affordable
give a good phase sounds like waylon would use
i dont really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described
the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat2
its inexpensive and the padding is excellent
because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well
i got these for my dad for christmas
it takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new
i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements
i have no issues with quality or feel its too loose
i highly recommend these tuners
this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer
it doesnt cause any problem with the products performance
great quality for such a low price
so ive become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar
see my review on the music stand
this is so out there that i wont let it influence my rating
i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now
you will not be disapointed by it
you will not be sorry
a spring clamp type capo would serve better
i have nothing negative to say about this
i have kk pickups in other guitars
but i think thats the best light to shine on this one
and the sustain is improved
these strings are the best all around for tone clarity punch and volume
he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar
plastic comb with no recess
nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively
fits my very old acoustic just right
it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty
its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed
the tripod base has been very steady so far
i can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar
gerlitz makes this wax easy not greasy
i like its simplicity and reliability
adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard
very good idea and holds it perfectly
its easy to use clip it on and go
no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use
ive played guitar for over 10 years
i bought this to use in childrens church
and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i havent tried yet
the only drawback is you cant have your ipad in a case
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs no success
durable yet lightweight and sturdy
i paired this up with the ma400 and it works great
seems like i found a winner
when it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner
yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows
this is a prime instrument
found pedal wasnt engaging when pushed down
by todays standards thats as good as it gets
switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck
bought it as a gift
i could not be happier
this is my second makala gig bag
it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it cant
it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultraeasy to use
this fender tuner is a great alternative
they are not strap locks
took it on vacation so i didnt have to leave my axe at home
however i dont like the plastic end pieces
especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time
this is a great practice tool
this interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint
dont use a bigger bit
before you dive into the presets
i am happy i bought this
regarding the sound it is unbelievable
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy
does exactly what it says itll do
it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design
not a lot to say works great as a shockmount
what more can i say
solid hardware side mount ac power
soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level
at least try a new tube before giving up
windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups
it sounds great it works perfectly and it was 40
proper use of a traditional nonlocking tuner is just as stable
if youre new it helps you find what you like
my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks
far better than any light weight chrome stand this has guts
they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge
very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles
it is a good pedal
i have an fcb10 that i use and like great controller for the price
great value and quality for 11 i spent ever
i love these carry bags
out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive
this cable is mono only ie not for stereo recording
i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd
best price i have found is at amazon
moreover theres also a warranty for this item
it was also just noisy in the pedal chain
this thing has so many uses its ridiculous
it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments
toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc
got here in 2 days
i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro
2 things i forgot tuners wanna say 15 1
at ten dollars i think its a nobrainer
it sounds fine no issues
and if you blast your music the low end distorts
someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid
i use to use my sound card
i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised
sometimes they break but what pick light pick doesnt unless its nylon
having the built in gate is also nice and it works
i have been very pleased with it
some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation
im back with my wood block and am happy
for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect
i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers
so i hope all of this helps you with your decision
using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal
i ordered with my new guitar
at this price range this little effects pedal does admirably
first let me tell you what this pedal cant do
i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii
it compares itself to the ts right on the box and for good reason
this took a little getting used to but it does work very well
i have many different makes of power supplies
the ucg102 runs on an asio driver
and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks
but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation
which i purchase through amazon
unbeatable in price and quality
i bought these to replace a pair of athm45s i had for 6 years
tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar
it has a headphone jack also
these have good shielding not like the others
love the thing so far
ill probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon
the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing
it arrived on time and was as described
i keep ordering more of these picks
do not buy this piece of junk
im very happy with the solid build
behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit
looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for
there is no difference in the sound at all
i have not switched form martin strings on that guitar
the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesnt move at all
bought these and they worked great with my digitech delay reverb chorus and jaman
nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible
nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy
i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon
right out of the box playable
i could not beat the price
unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell
its better because it cleans all 6 at once
they last a long time
i need to order a couple more packs though
i use it on chromatic but it includes  bass uke and guitar too
the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing
this is true for either one of the models
fifth comes with an ac adapter
you really cant go wrong
this was an easy choice for me
however buying behringer products always require crossing fingers and hope that they last
what else is there to say
not much to say other than its a good cable
i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze
they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent
i wish it had a power button
this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps
this has been very helpful for me to check finger position
i was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin
i gave it four stars for that reason
and it works on so many instruments
i only installed into studs and wouldnt really want to try a drywallonly installation
occassionally there are problems with this set up
ah finally one of the real reviews
ok ill add a star your right i should add a star
i just got this and love it
reaching for pics is never a problem
ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day
unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle
not the same as a mxr so dont get your hopes up on that
do you want to play master of puppets by metallica
tuning is a breeze and is very stable
i never thought that it would be so solid
goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface
the range of fit seems pretty good to me
i was surprised of how well this stand is made
it is a nice looking cord
i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables
dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years
the sound has better definition
in the studio i wont use this pedal for that reason
thanks for a great product and good prompt service cheers
the telescope mechanism is quite well made
the best look and performance on a fender guitar
so by all means buy these on price but when you get your items
i just got the 3rd monitor
it seems extremely rugged again like boss pedals
i cant recommend this tuner enough
this strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable
as far as accuracy its right on in either setting
the ebow is a crazy concept
i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try
having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings
i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better
this boss pedal just didnt work that well for me
the picks were exactly as described
being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either
this is the right one
much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up
the effects sound excellent to me
this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy
i currently have 8 pedals setup on this board
great replacement and a definite upgrade
it sounds good and seems to be very durable
this is a great effect
this tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument
it puts guitars into the best tune
surprised me because its a largetoothed zipper
always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing
this is a nice strap
out of the box i was amazed at just about everything
works great stays out of the way
they are bright and feel really good on my hands
makes any guitar look so much classier
sounds very authenic 60s too
for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat
oh and and the cost
it also looks great to talent in your studio
this stand is a little difficult to open
initially installed jj el84s after reading so many good reviews about them
this makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price
put this on a gibson j45
good tone good sustain and they stay in tune
fantastic pedal especially considering the price
ive done a good bit of recording over the years
and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy
if you set it at 10 or 11 oclock its plenty loud enough
bought stand as a gift for my sons acoustic guitar
there are also with two dimples
its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle
finger slides are much harder with these strings
now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic
everything about the pedal is rugged and durable
just in time for my first lesson
i own 3 now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection
this baby is worth every penny and i highly recommend it to any guitarist
my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these
really i cant tell that they do
the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link
action is low but does not buzz very easy to chord
i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case
ive used ernie ball fender prs just all kinds
yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends
i love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing
works with my boss ds1 ac adapter too
at home might sound ok
they have a nice stage presence
gibraltars model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time
great little stands at a great price
setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic
great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection
these are fantastic and unique guitar picks
i assumed incorrectly that both sides were black
the tech at the guitar shop cant see how either
i will stick to gls products from this point forward
an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed
thats the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal
i find the elixir excellent
i am happy with the quality of all of them
great mic stand for the price
this little bottle goes a long way
i wish i could find a guitar bag that was this nice
i have these on all my guitars
this is the second tuner i have bought like this
its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off
i just used some 2 drywall screws
why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately
no damage at all to any of them
they work very well on the floor
this is a very nice cable for the price
you will not be sorry
pluck a string and it will indicate what it is
anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful
each song have a chart on which chord you will use
maybe they corrected the problem if one exited
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand
otherwise easy and a great product
very easy to install as compared to other systems
i returned the skb ps45 and got the pt2 as a replacement
my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item
works for my behringer xm1800s mics
they last forever and dont rust
sure you can spend more on a slide but i see no reason to
500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter
these are nice and sturdy picks
for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal
i hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries
and how it goes out of tune fast
check out this rather entertaining howto video to see the installation process
this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand
you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic
i honestly dont see the purpose
a sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too
for the price its a must have
a great choice for the price
check out some youtube tests before buying
first off id like to address any construction concerns
a real money saver in the long run
i have a vox ac4tv
you will get 2000 worth of use out of it though for sure
may not power some pedals that have a high current draw
as a matter of fact i ordered 2 more
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily
it appears to be well made and durable
i honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all
i do not hear any external noise
if i plug the us100 back in the settings revert again  very reliable
theyre wonderful folks and they do excellentlyaffordable work
and it is not a toy
it is barely workable for two
first the material that the neck rests in is very soft
i tune the a to 432 and this works well for that
arrived on time and as described
these are heavy duty and well made
so he mentioned this capo and i immediately chortled
sometime i use a phaser or a tremolo
purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home
i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp
playing weekinds and practicing they last a long time with the same sound quality
it mutes the violin to a reasonable level
i was very surprised how well built it is
i play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in columbus ga
its extremely sensitive slightly more so than the snowflake
it also has a nicely padded handle
this polytune 2 is amazing  bright accurate strobe option well built
the price is good i bought it locally for the same price here
bending down picking them up then throwing
highly recommended very happy with purchase
im using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation
i am average build and play a strat
the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent
it gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price
its affordable and it works
these are perfect for a fastpaced style of picking
i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele
it is a good value
the low price tag didnt hurt my feelings either
this is a really nice product for the price
shines nice and doesnt leave it feeling oilysticky
pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion
i pretty much thought they were all the same
recommend for small budget studios
i bought the ebony with pearly inlay
the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd28
the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses
will order again if needed
it fits my line 6 jtv variax in a very cozy way
the stand makes my setting professional
forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too
not sure how a nonpiezo pickup would affect the tone
this was the easiest tuner i had
then youre left with several pieces to schlep
i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded
for me the guitar is not an everyday instrument
for under 200 im amazed at how nice this guitar is
it is made very nice
however it doesnt even show up in the product picture on amazon
like i said for the price you cant beat it
i tried these strings on my zager guitar
its so bad i just cant use it at all
plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus
these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks
nice works and no problem
the nylon is very strong i do not see it fraying in the future
the super slinkys sound great
i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar
the strings are true to elixirs quality and tone
for me the 11s felt a little loose
not only is it accurate and easy to use but its so convenient
practice amp this is the amp for u its definitely high quality its got
it easily clamps onto my stand and doesnt move around after i place it
most of my cables are from planet waves and ive never had an issue
this was a christmas gift from my husband
you could drive nails with this thingno exaggeration
but as a platform for greatsounding mods you cant go wrong
made of metal it should last a lifetime
be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes
however animals could have been harmed in the making
they also cost about twice as much as equivalent noncoated daddarios
overall though itll do the job
these string play good and stay in tune pretty well
i really like the mediums
i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it
ive been recording professionally for 27 years music radio commercials and television mostly
i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon
and this one fit the bill
update  the letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly
the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic
minus one star for a little price gouging
this is one of the best pedals i have on my board
both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses
the first is energyxt2 which i believe includes a license for the compact version
this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar
my reviews for this have changed a few times but no more
i am using it with win7 64bit  sonar xl producer
first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board
probably wont be a daily driver but interesting none the less
kit that finally went bad
after testing a set i have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars
best looper for the money
we will never run anything other than this design going forward
the pedal itself is built like a rock
and too hard to figure out
oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it
will review each one as they come in from amazon
for its price and qualityi giving it a 5 star  o
they arrived on time and i will order them again
daddario strings are simply the best
i can trust that i will be in tune
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks
below is thewarning verbatim from amazon
they loop two strings together and i hate that
give these a try and let me know what you think
comes with nice screw on 18 to 14 adaptor
the tones are rich and warm
for the price the functionality is excellent
its sturdy well made and cheap
as for the replaceable reed plates
an excellent value for the money
and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp
not recommended for band environments
wet means more of the effect and dry means less
also with my win7 x64 machine
i had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom
the classicmodified switch is pretty cool
i built a custom cabinet and installed this baby
no popping or clicking at all
this is my first electric tuner
right now i am just writing to get the required words out
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
yeah i think i did
the ends seem to be well made
i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument
i use these on an old gibson semihollow body
now i can take it along and use it in europe asia and usa
for 4000 you cant go wrong with this one
i was pleasantly surprised to find it wellmade with a clean simple appearance
good luck on your search i hope this review has helped
the result was poor sound
it came well padded and was in excellent shape
but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs
after applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable
i just use them for different tones
it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion
picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps
so this was my first real tuner its very simple to use
this is a quality product
been working without a problem to this day
i remember these from 35 years ago in high school band
there are better tuners out there
using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder
re computers and drivers  almost all the tests went well
i finally got the best out of that set of strings
it makes a great temporary hard shell case
they all differ somewhati fell in love with this one the most
the tuner is very accurate and compact
very nice clip on tuner for the price
but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldnt recommend this item
the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm
have been for the last 30 years
they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
i always use the 100mm for guitar had to test them with bass strings
i was going to buy the boss rv5 when i somehow discovered biyang
nice thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky
its now my go to amp in the studio
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products have always presented
and is just the best and simplest design
but this is true for most strap lock systems
i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button
they made my cordoba c5 sound like a more expensive guitar
it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it
i installed them on a korean made washburn wg587v
thanks samson now just make better mics
my ears remain attentive to future string sounds
very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic
i mix and master all my own music on these guys
these cables work very well at transmitting sound
it is better than samsons inexpensive gomic which i also have
8 guitars now are fitted
granted this was caused by me dropping it once but before it was fine
id pay double for these strings all day
all of that said the strings are pure joy to play
its easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds1
i bought these because they were an 34addon34 offer and im glad i did
this guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather
for me and my son it works great
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
im pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years
i use for both electric and acoustic guitars
no other distortion pedal can do it as well
go with the fast fret
it even comes with a matching polyester gigbag
much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem
could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough
well built and solid stand
it doesnt have that 34cheap34 feel about it
if i lost this box id immediately order another one
large enough to fit the fender tuners
these are thin and flexible
i did purchase the protection plan for 10 so im covered for 2 years
i have use this tuner for quite a few years
im a gadget lover and this is a good one
being perfectly  protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it so
that may not be enough for some but works great with my studio mike
an easy item to recommend for the price paid
if youre expecting an sm57 then buy an sm57
i can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones
its sturdy and very portable
overall a fantastic product with a price that cant be beat
works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect
sat on my snark  good tuner but takes some patience
even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar
pick that is i did have an older brother
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together
ill update this review when i get the new amp later this week
does what it should and yamaha quality
they sound amazing and feel fantastic
you get what you pay for
they stand out because everyone loves the idea of them
first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved
it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power
with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect
this one built like a tank
this amp is well worth the price
tip  a little goes a long way
the nonslip surface doesnt take long to wear off but i have a workaround
the price was right im happy with it
this is the most awesome loop pedal ever
it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent  dirt but thats it
they grip your head snugly without that horrible 34vice grip34 feeling
i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for 60 more
i have replaced packs twice
tusq saddles and nuts are the best synthetic out there
now the thing is worthless
a very nice pick both in feel texture and design
when it comes to noise gates this definitely does the trick
qualitywise it feels a bit cheapish
it is solidly built and apprears road worthy
the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet
i still write all my songs on this and play it more then my
id suggest that this is not for beginners
buy youll love it and if not you can always return it
i thought it wouldve lasted a little longer
this strap is very well made
i have switched to daddarios to capture that frusciante sound
so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable
hvr considering the price i think its excellent
this is a professional wireless system
this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but its gone now
was recommended to these picks by other users so i gave them a shot
works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course
the english instructions arent really useful as the pedal itself is selfexplanatory
but for 20 dollars its well worth the price
arrive on time and as described
i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar
its a nice thick cable
the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip
2012 were all 5star reviews
it has exceeded my expectations
theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which im happy with
does it for you so you dont have to do it by ear
for kicks try it out with some distortion andor overdrive and a wah
great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments
they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised
they have great sustain and sound nice and chunky
it does seem like it can break easily
popped one of these into my hartke lh500 bass head it it sounds great
i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat
the screen is so dark and only viewable head on
we are a tough act to follow
id use it for lightweight guitars
the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul
they are very good tuners and i highly recomend any tuners this company makes
why buy this after the experience of the others
i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar
the display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate
the design is simple and easy to understand and use
after a dunlop lock failure i decided to change over
the included ableton live 8 lite software recognized the unit as well
highly recommended for the price
good price for a good product
they sound and feel great
if you have no sense of smell get one
i have never broke a daddario acoustic string
one of them was particularly great
a cute little monster thats surprisingly loud and versatile
you should have one of these in each gig bag
its only got a basic feature set but thats all i need
it was an 34uh duh34 moment
its got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust
15delivered is about the cheapest priceanywhere
ill just nip the ends off if i need to replace them later
but it hasnt broke yet and it might never break
i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose
having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal
it is also very easy to hold unlike the deans i have found
great for lead playing and with small fingers like i have they feel great
not as good as say a boss unit but they cost 5x as much
especially for the 100 tag on it
volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4
bought this hosa pedal cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal
the construction of this set is superb
another strength of these is durability
it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews
at least its cheap though
i would definitely buy a few more of these
this is a very comfortable strap
now about the amp itself
works really well considering how inexpensive it is
its has a deep overdrive
these strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely
but on first play it pleasantly surprized me
id give them 35 stars if i could
the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand
save your money unless your under 10 years old
fender truly went to 11 on this one
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise
its built like a brick and durable as all getout
these stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced
the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl 2010 multipattern studio mic
one battery  this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other
no way to send it back im not from the states
recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar
the polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster
all in all this is a great guitar for a great price
sound on the other hand
this may sound silly but just to let you know you can do it
i have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years
still has some orange peel but not a lot
this was time and money well spent
there are tons of effects
within 5 minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect
there is no close second
been buying them ever since and love them
i buy one of these for each guitar
i had issues with the packaging
the second one arrived with a low battery
i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is
generally five or six at a time in various locations
thats to be expected in a passive di box and it doesnt bother me
great product for the price
driven full distortion it adds sustain
i will probably stick with daddario since i dont find any difference in them
he lost it after performing in a play on stage
i have four snarks and one other brand
this little cable gets used on my practice amp
channel switching is a breeze with almost no delay
that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks
i also have purchased several red blue and the new super tight tuner
i use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars
if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it
switching to these was not a problem at all
just a note of caution though
i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions
super cool pedal with tons of applications
who knows maybe theyll wear in and improve
yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not
really quick to setup and use
great product for entry level and great price for what you get
i dont expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me
works as advertised for polishing my guitars
if you really need some get some more substantial pads
i know cause i playem geetar real goodlike
and on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the price
not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however
perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard
88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase
e removes the pops from vocal recordings
or heck even just a little better
for the price this is the best tuner out there right now
ive not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking
led indicators good and flash the speed
if you are looking for s nice rich sound this is it
for any beginner this is the guitar i would but in there hands
mine lasted for a couple of weeks
all in all great value for a good item
very secure effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe
it costs a buck thirty
that prevents a lot of damage
having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting
they are a great idea
especially when i bust out the old tascam 4 track cassette
thats all there is to say about it
im pretty crafty and really like this
bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesnt cost much
i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally
then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck
it gives the boost i need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever
darrario does sell some fine strings
its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely
another thing is the price point which is simply amazing
these things grab the mic and wont let go
buy thisthese pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny
clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out
this is our second one as we both have guitars
effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion
then i recheck with my other brand and its not even close
and with 24 minutes of looping time thats just crazy for the price
worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard
no cheap way is there
surely not but its the best cheap one
these sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report
i didnt put it down for a couple of weeks
it sounds very nice especially for the low price
there is a volume knob but no independent basstreble adjustment as on other monitors
the only issue was with some manufacturing detail
what i expecteda more dead sound than the noncoated strings they replaced
my guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug
the capo is solid on the neck
these strings are well packaged and easy to unroll and string on my guitar
a very boring dull uninspiring pedal
it required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup
guess thats why the price is so cheap
