this is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling
you have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well
works amazing in fl studio
small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play
it tunes without any problems
and i love using the word snark
this tuner looks nice and works great
it puts guitars into the best tune
it has lasted for over a year and the battery hasnt died yet
great price great tuner worth the buy
i still love these things
a new batterry lasted me almost two years
my first tuners battery it came with lasted over a year
expect to pay 5 to 6 for a replacement battery
my more recent snarks are still running on original batteries
all i wanted was a simple tuner
pros  works fastaccurate and can recognize full chromatic scale
cons  built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped
theyre reliable and easy to use
why no 5 star review
the provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming
a rechargeable version would be good
silent tuning so on stage its almost a must
my main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate
it also occasionally fails to register at all
the other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear
unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch
i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background
this is definitely more accurate than a persons ear while other instruments are playing
as you can tell by the title ive got another of these little babies
snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great
other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50150 and more
does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal
first let me tell you what this pedal cant do
it wont do long delays
analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic
users of mxr carbon copy swear by them
the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal
this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints
i dont use a long delay time in fact i dont max it out
i only use about 7580 percent
before judging this pedal please experiment on its placement on your pedal board
placing after the distortion pedal sounded better
now its in the effects loop just like my other delay
the sound has better definition
ultimately you and your gear will have the last say
overall a good deal for the price
and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer
i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound
i read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the rogue
i have countless delay pedals and racks
this inexpensive delay is very special
it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay
it sounds great clean or dirty
its a relatively short delay which is great for many genres
its bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music
many musicians use two delay pedals
i know i often do
both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for
the unit itself seems sturdy and well made
i use carbon zinc batteries in mine
they just seem to sound better to my ears
keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time
true bypass and no hiss
great surprise as i never took rogue seriously
never thought itd be my goto pedal
the rogue analog delay is wellconstructed and feels very high quality given the price
that being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway
you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger
its won a spot on my pedalboard and im picky
when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised
the guitar came in great shape
it was packed well and didnt have any damage on it
overall im extremely pleased with my purchase
the pick guard looks a bit cheap but thats just nitpicking
if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one
i am extremely happy with this purchase
new to guitars but in 24hrs
it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings
i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100
i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies
rogue is musicians friends brand
music 123 is a musicians friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars
heres the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender
it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument
they look play and sound great
many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price
they figure a guitar that cheap cant be much good
you have to actually play one to understand what im talking about
once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer
the rogue ra090 comes in a variety of color choices
this review is my honest opinion
good string action out of the box
nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone
when it dies i will buy another one
this pedal was priced very well 32 and had nearly a 5 star rating
its obviously simple to use having one knob and all
over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made
but on first play it pleasantly surprized me
im really happy with this pedal
give a good phase sounds like waylon would use
i do not use a dramatic effect more or an evh setting for leads
this pedal is 998 sounding like the mxr
i never give anything a 100
this is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price
i am done thinking a good pedal must cost 200 and above
this was like 35 and sounds awesome
ive used it for 8 months with no issues at all
it sounds great it works perfectly and it was 40
ive been playing for 29 years and i highly recommend joyo pedals
if you dont like it get a refund
classic tubescreamer tone at 14 the price
one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp
id definitely buy it again
a dull inept version of a tubescreamer
just sounds flat and boring
then again i never did really like tss
been playing for 30 years and i have used tube screamers extensively
it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components
are there better tube screamer clones out there
probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit
build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation
really wanted to like this one because i loved the price
there is no way this is true bypass
i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something
this is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money
those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere
you cant blame a chicken for not quacking properly
they will be none the wiser
awesome with my ltd vc401 with 59 and jb pickups
yep i said it better than a tubescreamer
this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat
its perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up
i honestly was not impressed
of course the board is layed out a little differently
if you need an 808 clone on the cheap this is your pedal
this is a really nice sturdy pedal with a really warm tone
i have a marshall mg15cfx solid state amp
great classic rock 70s tone
it responds really well to my pick attack
you really cant go wrong for the money
this thing stands up nicely on all three
sounds amazing in any combo
giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth
outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with hossen
the pedal is everything i expected from it
a definite improvement on a classic stompbox
nice work joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist
in my opinion this thing is well worth the price
full range achieved from 6 to noon
so i took a chance on this little stompbox from china
it compares itself to the ts right on the box and for good reason
they use the same chip
more importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedalboard space
it turned my partscaster into a blues making machine
it truly does have true bypass and logical controls
and i saved about 70 or 80 bucks
the digitech bad monkey is one such example
im definitely a fan of joyo products
its very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer
does it sound like an overdriven amp
it sounds great for blues and rock
ive heard that these can be fragile but im pretty gentle with my gear
if it breaks ill post about it
this unit is of high quality though
one of the the best lights i own
great laser nice big fat stars red and green worth the money
point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me
despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely
the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace
i havent tested the soundfeature but ive seen it on videos
i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained
this is the american dj micro galaxian red  green laser
i am very pleased with it
this is a great buy under 100
pros  it is small bright well built and works great
it has a remote to control it
cons  transformer on cord and antenna on remote
only used it a couple times so far but i like it
i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar
but otherwise i think its great
i like how it smells does that make me strange
i tried this about 3 months ago
i use fender 150ls and with it the longevity doubles
i play every day and gig one or two nights
they normally go dead in a week or less
i just did my 3rd weekend with the same set
i put it on when necessary on gig breaks
i just ordered 2 more of these
obviously i think it a good product
update about 2 years later  i wont do without these
they also last quite a long time maybe 7 months
purchased this for my son who plays both acoustic and electric guitars
hes absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner
great buy prompt shipping great product
open cap rub across strings a few times
doesnt leave the strings oily or full of residue
i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with
so thanks to amazon for making this possible
otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great
but is a good product
this really cleans your strings
saves some money on replacements
i cant say much about this product
the strings didnt sound betteer or brighter
now it sits in my drawer and collects dust
maybe i will try it again at some point but
its better because it cleans all 6 at once
the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new
the great part about it is the design
unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item
go with the fast fret
i give it just 4 stars though due to its design
wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass
little to no excess residue
i just dont know what kind of liquid to use
bottom line it extends the life of my strings and thats always good
i honestly dont see the purpose
it doesnt seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar
ive used it a few times but dont see the benefit
there was no greaselubricant qualities
it was like a dry erase pad
they need to improve their quality control
im changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star
while this is not a 300 tape delay
its a solid pedal that gets it done
its way better built than other pedals in this price range
playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine
in my experience of course ymmv
overall its a great deal
i purchased this pedal with good expectations
i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained
i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus
this is a very good quality nice sounding delay
nothing fancy but simple and to the point
another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass
i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise
they say that they are true bypass but they are not
these babies are dead quiet
i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay
ive had the digitech xseries multidelay for many years
solid hardware side mount ac power
goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now theyve updated its look
i bought this not for the tuner but because i needed a metronome
however i had to give the tuner a try as well
i only have one minor complaint
you cant view the snark sn4 at any kind of sharp angle
you need to view it head on
if you place it on your music sheet stand thats great
an integrated flip out kickstand would make this perfect
i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews
in addition this one has a metronome
i like this very much and may well buy another
that said its lovely to see the strings true in
makes even first tuneup easy
banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice
does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do
works well with my stuff
this is definately worth the money
bought another one for my friend
the metronome feature is also a nice addition
it works well with several different instruments that i have
makes tuning a lot easier and accurate
it is a good value
i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner
these are the best tuners for the money
the display is very stable and its simply fun and easy to use
i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good
i havent had much chance to play it but so far so good
it seems like it is good quality
this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid 4999
there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality
amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem
there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector
prosportability easy of use and set up
buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldnt have any worries
the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp
if your looking for the best
practice amp this is the amp for u its definitely high quality its got
10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp
definitely the best amp in this
i havent jacked it up all the way
i dont think the cat would appreciate that
how do you get that much noise out of an 834 speaker
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes
this cable is complete garbage
cable would be ok if the end connections would stay screwed together
maybe some lock tight would help
i was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this
but its a nice cable
no noise or hum whatsoever
it looks cool and sounds just fine and clear
i will be buying these again
i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home
i really liked the sound
it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg
it looked great and felt solid
then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case
the rattle just got worse louder as i played
the design is solid well made and will go the distance
bought so i could teach my son bass
i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box
i was really looking forward to receiving this amp
i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight
i tried different basses with it
i tried different cables with it
i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights
i tried all different knob and eq settings as well
i really hope its a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful
it also just looks cool and very pro
the customer service is so easy and immediate its worth the piece of mind
ill update this review when i get the new amp later this week
i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received
this was my first fender amp as well
the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on
is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue
definitely try this before you buy it
but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong
the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked
terrific for gigs or practice a back up or just beginning guitar
i traded in my line 6 and also purchased a roland micro cube
it also is feature loaded but with one kicker
the models of the vintage fender amps
the bassman is another that is just off the charts good
the lcd screen is bigger and overall very simple to use
the vox model is also really jangly sounding  like its supposed to
for 300 you can get a vox w an overdrive delay and reverb
it doesnt sound exactly like a vox  but i dont gig
im a basement rockstar  the mustang gets it done without any problems
adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive
thats without the fuse software
the virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp
to be clear  tube amps sound like tube amps
sometimes its noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible
some people think its the power supply but nobody knows for sure
there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz
if it didnt have this fizz i would give it a 5 star rating
i cant say enough good about this amp
but if you want something that is 90 close well this is it
so versatile light weight and well constructed
great fender quality for a great price
i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise
excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend
i gave it five stars
it sounds great and it has loads of power
both mac and windows are supported
my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively
since hes 11 he doesnt have many opportunities to play with others
he can create jamclick tracks and play along
we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired
he wanted a tone that sounded like his
we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people
one of them was particularly great
we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it
constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp
you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects
the controls are intuitive and easy to use
it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs
you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly
line 6 offers tons of sounds
they dont sound overdriven they just sound distorted
the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds
these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing
you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 8899
tons of character and tone
you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model
think the jimi blues cd
you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model
it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well
big bold bottom end with some singing highs
65 deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model
throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rockblues
or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone
the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps
they are all bold and in your face
just play one acdc riff into the 70s amp and youll recognize the sound
as far as the vintage tones go
i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere
i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good
the 90s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it
im pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model
this is certainly your metallica amp
the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic
i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp
they all sound very cool on this amp
the classic vibe 60s strat really impresses me through this amp
so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound
i am really loving it
i have 4 kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect
however youll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse
the system is super easy to use and store on your amp
but you will find some gems too
i hate overprocessed guitar tones
this amp is perfect for me
i have a 300 strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it
there is no better modeling amp for my needs
a cheap guitar at best
no bite to it at all
does not get me excited
but thats not what guitars are for right
itll serve its purpose until i can afford a real american strat
but passable id return it if i could
saw this in tv yellow and had to have it
fret work is top notch
a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up
if you cant make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech
when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue
picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound
this guitar will make you a more versatile player
sustain is very good as a result
i could carry on forever but you get the idea
ive been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that
i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch
i have several guitars and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar
well i was dead wrong
especially for the 100 tag on it
great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection
the simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat
i will not shy away from epiphone anymore
you can even work it into your live performances
you may have experienced the problems of musicians
the drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late
but you need to rehearse
otherwise easy and a great product
and have for 40 years
now with my boss rc3 i can do it any time i want
in rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful
or play along to develop my chops
that helps you understand a lot
a lot of fun and meaningful
like all boss pedals its as sturdy as a little truck
ive read some complaints about this unit
maybe those folksshould shell out an additional 300 for something better
for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track
i just loaded the whole prerecorded track into a slot
or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background
i loadedthe effect into a slot
i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot
really easy to use and well built
certainly do not get the rc 2
i couldnt be happier with this pedal
i have a les paulmarshall class 5bb preampep boosteranalog chorus and carbon copy
first off id like to address any construction concerns
the supplied mini usb cable fits nice and snug
item shipped earlier than ive expected
when i opened the box was surprised as i didnt notice the usb cable
i have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds
though it has no motorized faders it doesnt make my work uncomfortable at all
i recommend it to home studios also those who travel with recording gear
nano is small but quite durable
i am happy with it
for the price its a really good deal
great little controller for your daw or whatever
dials and sliders work smoothly
i use it with reaper
windows 7 install worked fine
i use mixcraft pro 6 and its working well
great product for the price
i am using it with win7 64bit  sonar xl producer
i just held down the setmarker  record button while plugging the usb cable
i then let windows 7 plug  play the drivers no disk needed
now i have 8 channels of automation  stop back record play etc
i am very happy with this product so far
i have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio
i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl
buttons and sliders and great for the price
this is the first delay that ive owned and im not looking back
many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion
the vintage bbds mxr vintage delay morley 70s echo for example just take it
if you love delay and want variety this is your pedal
being toneprint enabled is a 100 plus
very clean quiet and durable
wish all pedals were built this way
this pedal is a great delay pedal
works well with my marshallhas a lot of feautures and is very versitale
presets tap tempo and a nice feature set
but the sound just lacked warmth
it was very digital soundingat this point i wasnt sure what i wanted
analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy
digital delays were clear sounding but
just too digital and uninspiring
analog dry signal thru with digital delay
this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion
set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect
but 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for me
buy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed
skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc
what more could you want
i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek
my apologies to those pros out there who didnt need this clarification
it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous
the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy
the build quality of the mic is excellent
the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet
if samson included software  itd be a 5 star product for me
its a very solid fairly large item made of heavy cast metal
you could drive nails with this thingno exaggeration
it is better than samsons inexpensive gomic which i also have
i certainly have no complaints
i use this when i broadcast from streetjellycom
it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions
you have to do it from the software
of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably wont care
just got this today and im experiencing serious install issues
please note that im not a newbie to this stuff
the samson tech support was friendly enough but not very helpful
they had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support
but i still have a 70 mic that wont work with my computer
we tried it a number of ways and nothing worked
i ended up returning the whole shooting match
it also helped my boyfriend decide also
exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope
hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though
design looks great in the light too
most of the band members dont mind them
the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet
but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less
a little disappointed with the cable
dont know why it didnt work just shorted out
luckily one of the band members had another one
wouldnt trust it again so i returned them
good cable and has m et all of our needs
its fairly tough but flexible
no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidlymounted
i would definitely buy this brand again
what more could you want
i wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after i change guitars
i bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap
it has served its purpose and i use it nearly everyday
i dont trust it and amazon has it way over priced
i am going to be finding picks in my files for years
put it up on the table when your picks are not in it
another excellent gadget from planet waves
already has made my life easier
the guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible and that means
youre more apt to grab your axe and play more
no big deal at all
the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles
i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over
its quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument
this is a pretty cool product
the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves
maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it
genius idea that i wish i thought of first
as long as the guitar is on it works great
even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over
addendum   i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributormanufacturer
at least these guys listen
i never use it so i really only wasted my money
as the title it works the way its supposed to
just remember use some common sense dont expect the guitar to totally stable
but id expected more robust on your structure
dont have adhesive to bind on the surface
it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table
this was a christmas gift from my husband
it is such cool and easy rest for the guitar
i think this guitar rest is pretty nice
this simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables
other then that i like it and purcheased a second one
it is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs
there is also one available that looks like a guitar
a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality
good idea but it doesnt work
without those picks its just black molded flab
the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful
i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box
it may not be much to look at but it works really well
the top portion that rests on a table surface is about 14 inch think
thats about 58 inch thick
if you can find this for less at a local shop go for it
even at that i consider it a good buy
i just cant trust it
but i just cant get myself to do it
i always end up using a little fender portable stand
it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp
i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand
overall  i like it
this is a great value for a practice and travel instrument
i bet if you bought one you would like it
its the same as the one amazon is selling here
i teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele
it is very similar to a guitar in many important ways
it has the same 6 strings tuned the same way
it will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar
the action is very good and it will not be any harder to play
the instrument overall is fairly easy to play especially in the lower positions
almost all celtic music sounds great
christmas carols are lovely but spanish stuff doesnt sound so great imho
the instrument just doesnt have enough power to carry some types of music
i would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun
the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful
on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy
you can use a capo with this instrument
mykyser capoworks on it just fine
the guitalele measures 2712 x 9 x 234 at their widest points
the package includes a black nylon gig bag
im a man on the move and am constantly away from home
it was brand new unopened in box
they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase
in that environment i thought it a nice instrument
this is indeed a 6string ukulele
i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range
its tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe
so all is not lost there
so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument
thats where the yamaha really falls short
there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box
the action is of course too high
but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here
id think its was a cheap knockoff childs guitar
theres not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing
this instrument sells for about 100
that low cost is obvious
this is a cheap guitar in every way
i cant honestly say its a toy but it reeks beginner instrument
however ive been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca
years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap
and no im not hawking epiphone
facts is facts thats all
you can read my verypositive review on the epiphone on amazon
consider it overpriced or rather undermade
one must grant its largely a matter of personal taste and expectation
but low quality is low quality
the cordoba is much nicer
its built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely
sorry yamaha but facts is facts
i know some will disagree
but others know exactly what i mean
as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same
the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks
very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range
this is one of the best pedals i have on my board
it is part of 34my sound34
most the reverb selection sound identical
i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better
i use this pedal in my pedal chain
it doesnt get much action my amp has a reverb
i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar
the 34hall34 setting is phenomenal
transparent in your signal chain when off as well
the best nonrackmount reverb i have ever had
so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet
this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain
the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb
excellence once again from tc
this is the first and only tc electronic product ive ever purchased
i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard
it has exceeded my expectations
the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak
the toneprint feature is amazing
downloading is quick and easy
dont ask me how it works but it does
i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future
i thought the boss pedal sounded pretty bad
to my ears the rest were less distinctive
nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb
what else can i say
this is an absolutely amazing reverb pedal
you can spend hours finding 34your sound34 or just 34the sound34 that you need
i bought this unit because my amp doesnt have reverb
but i discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds
really you hate warm sustaining naturaltube overdrive you wont like it at all
this is my favorite od pedal that i have
this thing really wants to sing to you
there are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers
i pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers
the knobspots are nice and the basstreble pots are notched at 12
turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts
of course none of this means i will stop buying od pedals
there really is nothing not to like about this pedal
c level control provide from ve to high ve boost
tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank
what can i say this pedal has never left my pedalboard
the thing is dense and build solid as a rock
the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy
this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer
hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone
power is about 46 hours of continuous recording
i can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the gb card
this is usually a little more than i require when jamming
i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well
i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels
the first arms the track the second begins the recording
for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case
best recorder for the money ive seen
easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings
the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is
the only thing the other has on this one is its size
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
their differences for your  ears
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
not really that good for  music
can be done but not as good
if you use ext mic
u wont be happy either
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
only slightly better than 05
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
this can be used to  semi  record music too
so testing on their own mics
that last one was far far better than the first two
means only that dr 40
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
upon comparing the resulting  cds
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
b  recorded dr40 and printed to cd
my budget must be tripled at least
and then to go out to test some more
no cheap way is there
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
this recorder is okay but its far from perfect
it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely
however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible
for this much i have no complaints
until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders
the tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine thats a pleasure to use
i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc
then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow
this has got to be heard to be believed
i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less
this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals
i dont think it lastforever but it works great for my peavey patriot guitar
i would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar
even in perfect condition its still a subpar case
disregarding those flaws its still obvious that its not a good case
it also wont stand evenly on end if thats important to you
but do yourself a favor and spend another 25 and get something better
this is a great value
this is a great guitar case and a great price
i bought it to keep my fender strat in and it works great
like many here the case could be an inch bigger
now mine closes without pressure on the bridge
i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work
now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there
i couldnt believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price
especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable
in this case i still got more than my moneys worth
its a good quality case
itll protect your mando just fine
i got one of those for my next mandolin after my johnson
these are pretty soft inside and fit most astyles pretty well
the hardware is decent but i wouldnt expect the hinges to last forever
theyll be easy enough to fixreplace when they fall off so no worries there
if its still built like my case never can tell these days
not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there
i order this for my glen burton cutaway
very well made and beautiful
it came to me right on time with no problems at all
it is a little heavy but that is something i can get use to
my guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug
this thing is a beauty
plush interior hardware looks great and good quality
does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type
deep storage pocket and more
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time but thats not really a problem
size and fit were good
the storage compartment is nice and large
one hinge broke after about a year of normal use
it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured
you  might pay more for a name brand case
we found nothing negative that we could say about it
ive seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more
this is a hard shell tolex covered case
these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them
one is for my ibanez ak75g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly
its made in china but isnt most everything these days
dont be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better
for 40 its an awesome deal
exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money
fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase
very solid clasps one of which locks
i could not be happier
it fits well close well protects well transport well
unfortunately theres no 22nd fret on this guitar
i havent gotten that far yet
except for that 22nd fret oh well
all guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there
but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more
first the natural finish is what got me started
i wanted a strat copy that i could customize  this is it
use it with your headphones or home speakers
dont upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level
if your budget is below that dont bother and save more
speak from experience ive tried a lot and did many research
this guitar with amplug just sound amazing
so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money
this guitar is good enough for any beginners
most under 400 guitars dont have good pickups so why spend extra money
again my bloody experience taught me that
ive spent time and money way more than 1000 free advice
i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price
fit and finish is quite nice
feels solid and stays in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions
the body is very solid beautiful finish mine is a sunburst color
for 7995 this is a must buy
you will not be sorry
i have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite
i just bought a zoom g5 and it works great with that
the tones are rich and warm
it fits so well in my hands and feels great
i figured id buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one
one of the cheapest prices on amazon
and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has
i was also hoping that it played well
i would recommend to anyone
keep up the good work
just gotta love that vibe
anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good heres a few add ons in case
its routed hsh under the hood but looks tight
think its bucker size upgradable top and bottom didnt measure i like single coils
it is alder and hefty but durable
2 things i forgot tuners wanna say 15 1
seem good not legendary and tremelowhammy standard zinc block theres the must upgrade part
not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 13 its beefier
size hands i find its a good fit
i am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar
mine arrived in perfect condition
will only need a minor setup
after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved
next i proceeded to adjust the intonation
i love the red burst design of this guitar it looks absolutely wicked
unfortunately im going to have to return it
im going to get a squier strat instead with either amapleorrosewoodneck
then to my surprise the squier strat was delivered yesterday
i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated
its red burst like the legacy fender calls it antique burst
its a beautful guitar and and im loving it
this is a good guitar for the price
played well right out of the box
the finish is beautiful and i found no defects
sounds good and well worth the money
this is one great piece
the quality of the guitar is amazing
and for its price outstanding
it plays beautifully with my 100w amp
i am happy with it
good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have
not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks
used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices
ended up i picked dr07mkii for slightly less
feel like its a tricky rebate
this unit works as advertised
ive used it to record my garage band shows
if your a musician or want to be
enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
the use of the device was moderately difficult
the primary difficulty was in the how the users manual was written
this left me to the old plug and chug method
once i figured out how to set it up
i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker
it works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas
it sounds good natural and spacias
i paid 110 shipped for mine so look on amazon or ebay for purchase
the big music stores always mark up the prices very high
zzounds musicians friend sweetwater music 123 dont buy from them
just use a smartphone to record stuff
not really worth the 75  i returned mine
the dr07mkii has worked well for over 100 classes recorded
you can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually
this makes it easy to copy to my pc and keep organized
most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians
this is the better choice for musicians
well i got a recording without sound
the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero
once i figure that out all was right again in my universe
the more aggressive recording level solved that problem
i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results
im sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though
for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders
i got what i expected with my purchase you will too
i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades
i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way
true bypass means no tone suck to boot
high points for the delays reverbs and mods
the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat2
too expensive foronly one effect at a time
fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky
synthy  seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes
octave  bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers
i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets
the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position
i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc
the m5 is serving that purpose
the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist
they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone
this single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects
a lot of overdrivedistortions filters modulations delays reverbs all carefully modeled
when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion
it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal
its got an attitude but it soft at the same time
its truly a one of a kind product
i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal
make a note it is not a metal pedal
not by any means actually
but for what it is it is fantastic
cool pedal on a clean amp
i think it will work great for that
still i needed a distortion that could cover of the marshall soundlike roar jcm800
and this guy did the job
its not a riot but
pretty much defends its self from the old 7080s songs
great overdrivedistortion for classic rock music
its quiet and has a very active tone control
im a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s  vibe
i like that the pedal has a wide array of uses
the build quality seems questionable from mxr
i have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way
even the crunch button is just a louder sound
guess thats why its so cheap
there are a few more different models and brands that are good
distortion is incredibly subjectiveit depends on your rig and your tastes
basically if you get the right setup youll get great tone
in a chain running into an amps input there is a slight volume increase
not much but a little
no big deal really unless youre a real tone freak
there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use
being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either
the box is ultra solid
the jacks are all metal
it it anchored to my board
it is not going to come off because its that good
this box does the trick
construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis
and silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board
this is a very good piece of equipment for its price
used mildly it gives the sound a more natural feel
pretty cool knockoff of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo
this is my 2nd or 3rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far
at least theres no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion
this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from
from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only 40
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes
im going to sell this product
the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck
its just as good as any i love the joyo pedals
for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect
in fact there really werent that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market
enter the joyo jf09 tremolo
this pedal is simple durable affordable 40  45 and it just works
as for the sound  the pedal sounds great
it doesnt color or diminish your tone in any way
im not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should
this device works well but sound is far from perfect
distortion is more noticeable at higher volume
for the price paid is a very reasonable option
cant beat it for the price
it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl
the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar
all pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar
the feedback can be to to many other issues
i have issued the refund of 704
i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises
well surprise surprise surprise it didnt feedback and it sounds great
i would recommend this product
i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out
this one is definitely the best
great value and price too
i didnt expect much considering the price
it works so great i ordered a few more
each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky
that is a great bonus for me
very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it
i would recommend this product to a friend
i really like the cherub pickup
i just play at home with friends
it works well so far on all my ukuleles
this thing should sound louder next time ill buy a duncan pickup
then i stumbled on this cherub pickup
bottom line is that it works very well for my needs
if youre a rockgod dont even consider this why would you anyway
this is more of a toy than a good pickup
it functions but doesnt sound great
what did i want for this price anyway
what a buy for the price
put it on the headstock
its less than ten bucks
it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices
if you dont have a preamp system this will do you no good
so because of the limitations i rate it as above
this is a cool gadget
i love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals
it can do some strange things and get unique sounds
i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didnt work
whereas this does the job
i wouldnt reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage
this power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals
the variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects
i am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands
the price is great im planning to have several of this
the first power source that is fun
this may have been the best money ive ever spent for a guitar accessory
it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise
my guitar stays in tune when capoed
adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos
ive bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit
well the hunt is over
im completely amazed with this capo
works as designed on my acoustic
i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it
they work and are cool looking
i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great
well made proven over decades
switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck
square pad allows placement right next to the fret
easy to adjust with a bit of practice
so i heard these were good and ordered one to try
i was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down
ive used shubb for years
i strayed briefly on a fender smart capo
you can read my review on that item
the shubb works great on both
have others i trust more
it something nice to have around your house and work great
ive tried them all and i like the shubb the best
easy to use very tight and doesnt get in the way
seems a tad flimsy but time will tell
simple and easy to use easy to carry around
love it the display is cool and cant ask anything more
you go through batteries like crazy and it doesnt work at all for bass
i ordered a couple from my guitar seller
saw these and tried again
the box for tuner was a little smushed
but well packaged and arrived on time
will order again if needed
works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle
it is a great reliable tuner
works greatgreat little tuneri would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner
i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed
this is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal
i highly recommend them especially the ones with the builtin vibration sensor
i ordered this primarily for my 5 string ovation bass
also worked great on my 6 strings
my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings
very happy and pleased with this one
i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend
and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy
does what it was intended to do
completely satisfied with this purchase
seems to work just fine for my needs
the one that shipped was the cheaper shiny plastic one
in my experience this model is inferior
i like snarks and think they are some of the best clipon tuners
just not a fan of the cheap shiny plastic versions
ill try returning it and getting the sn8
i have a pretty crappy ear so i rely on it to tune correctly
responds fast display is incredible
i wish my car dash looked like this thing
fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind
even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well
forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too
for the price i would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one
this is a great little tuner and i recommend it
i really dont have anything more to say about it
ive played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever
affordable accurate and they dont fall off your knee all the time lol
the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small
great tuner for the price
makes tunning easy and fast
the grips come off the neck on my acousticbut works better on my electric
great tuner just bought 8 of them for xmas presents
very easy to use  clip on and go
tune my mandolin and banjo with it
this little snark is easy to carry around and works great
i was not sure about this at first
seemed too cheap to work
but i was happily surprised
not perfect but not expensive
this tuner is affordable and it works well
i have purchased six so far
if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery
we had a birthday jam at a friends house
i gave one to my grandnephews
i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars
they stay on in their cases
i also have one for my bass
its a great musicians party favor
dont forget  practice practice practice
snark tuners are the best
i bought this one and it works great
the first one started working about a week after i bought it
the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived
after piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner
these are manufactured on the cheap
they are great and last forever
this one is also super accurate and allows you to really finetune your instrument
really nice piece of equipment for a small price
its a pretty cool little gizmo
i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin
it works well for all of them and is inexpensive
i think the amazon price is the best youll find
it works as well as expensive tuners
be advised though that it only registers natural notes and sharps
but it doesnt just read the letter of the note your on
the graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it
for ten bucks you cant go wrong
this will b my 2nd one of these so to me its worth it
i think their pretty accurate
as far as battery life goes you can get them right on amazon
im pretty impressed with it
ive only used plugin types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise
i ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass
i was blown away how it could tune my bass
it works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen
i would recommend it to anyone
took one star off for visibility
certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily
my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin
i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly
i bought my dad one too
works well even with a room full of noise
plus its easy to see
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano
if it can tune that it should handle your guitar or bass fine
was really impressed to see it in action
not the smoothest operation in the world but its gigbag small and accurate
light takes up little space and easy to use
clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar
pluck a string and it will indicate what it is
turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done
takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar
works plugged in or unplugged
got this tuner for my new bass
i bought this to use on my fender pbass
im still using my roland stomp box tuner
snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find
and they tune with amazing accuracy
my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip
i liked the big boss tu1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations
it requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time
i dont think it picks up those long wavelengths so well
i will try the sn8 shortly and give this one to a friend
get a snark and you will be happy
this handles bass tuning much better
i also find it very accurate
this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer
ive had a few of these things not all the same model
this one was hard to read
i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit
overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal
this tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly
clamp it on press the power switch and then  pluck a string
shouldnt it have a full battery since it is brand new
not enough of a hassle to send it back but worth mentioning
had the battery not been an issue i would have rated this 5 stars
the bonus is that its also one of the least expensive that ive seen
any guitarist knows how one of these works
clamp it on the head turn it on and tune
ive tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass
it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well
all in all its a handy little tool to have in the gig bag
is very sensitive to vibration
the snark is great and the price is amazing
the snark unlike the korg tunes by vibration
so if it isnt attached the the guitar it wont work
i feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient
no metronome but thats what im keeping the korg for
i also wish that this specific came in another color other than black
there are snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars
overall extremely happy with this purchase
accurate with tv on in the background
this thing is just sweet i just love it
its just about deadon with my korg which is extremely accurate
good little tuner at a steal of a price
i play guitar bass and violin
in fact that may be saying too much
i was really surprised at the snark sn5 tuner
i found it very accurate
this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope
i am a longtime musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments
i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners
too bad they made this decision imo
having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation
this one is the most basic
all are fast and accurate
i also have purchased several red blue and the new super tight tuner
i own many tuners and clip ons of many other brands
the snark is by far my favorite
there is no close second
this is by far the best ive ever had
not only is it accurate and easy to use but its so convenient
cons wish i had this 20 years ago
bottom line this is a nobrainer
i really and suprisingly like this little gadget
it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate
this is a very accurate tuner
i have used it on mandolins guitars violins and violas and double bass
they are a little hard on batteries but not overly so
theres just one button so its idiotproof
i own the sn8 which btw is the best tuner ive ever used
so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin
i was also intrigued by the 34tighter34 tuning aspect of the bars on this
the one i received was completely useless
i am amazed at the great sn8
i am disappointed in this thing
they still work years later
ive had to change a few batteries but they last a long time
even works on a standup bass
just clip it onto the bridge
i love my snark sn5 tuner
with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process
the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins
it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying
i have other similar models and they are all great
dont hesitate to get one
these are three times as high at guitar center
this may sound silly but just to let you know you can do it
the snark sn5 tuner for guitar bass and violin gives me spot on tuning
i especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner
this tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument
i was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself asap
i lost one and had to buy another one
before i bought this i had to use a tuner on my laptop
i also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument
this one says specifically for a ukulele
the uke tuner here is gloss black and the snark2 is matte red
otherwise the size of the dialface the clip itself is precisely the same
so theres nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2
so choose whichever color you prefer and go for it
i will always buy snark tuners
they are very sensitive so i feel that my instrument is in truer tune
the display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate
i have use this tuner for quite a few years
its easy to use clip it on and go
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
easy to use very accurate highly recommended
the snark sn8 is far superior
tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly
have used it several times and first battery still has juice
works like its supposed to
although i should have just got the universal instrument tuner
this one only tunes in the uke keys
been using the snark tuners for while now
however thats me and ymmv as they say on the internet
dont ask then why i got a sn6
well thats not quite true
some models suffer fits in certain situations
a web search will reveal countless workarounds
lately ive become enamored of thekala kaubassfs solid mahogany ubass  fretted
if you want a tuning challenge the low bass e string is it
other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing
thats 5 stars in my book
this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off
it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts
its not just a uke tuner
and gavemy grandson a shockblue one to go with his american flag painted uke
works great and easy to use
it also seems to be very accurate
ive always tuned my ukuleles by ear
but im now a convinced snark user
pluck a string and tune it to the dial and eureka
buy one  youll like it
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
s display to be more than sufficient
im currently using the snark on my guitar
the snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable cardboard box
i have no problem with it but the hola
i dont really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a 34ukulele34 setting
other than that im not quite sure what makes it specifically a 34ukulele tuner34
this little gadget does the trick
now put that order in
these are great little tuners
so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts
its easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician
good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly
theyre great easytoread and easytouse tuners that are surprisingly cheap
one of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage
the screen is super faint
its still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting
this also happened to two of my friends snarks
my other snark is still going strong
however these definitely arent reliable gigworthy tuners
this little gem is worth its weight in gold
so easy to tune with it
automatic  shutoff helps too
i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport
i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement
with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers
i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward
with the jam i have this
3 the jam has a gain meter ie an led and a gain control
there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport
if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device
so far im very pleased with the jam
i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector
this is now a boat anchor
the extortion here is almost monster cable like
these folks should be embarassed
it doesnt snap in place
just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out
that makes it fairly useless
i may have simply gotten a defective one
but this is going to change all that
awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use
update   i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx 802
you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam
i may not even need that focusrite box now
i really cant say enough positive things about the apogee jam
pros extremely easy to use and widely compatible 62 no batteries required
considerably less feedback 62 this was actually the primary reason i decided to upgrade
high gain settings even something basic like a marshall jcm900 were practically unusable
the apogee jam cured all of that instantly
the jams improvement in avoiding feedback alone made it worth its price
you can still monitor your playing using the ipads headphone jack separately obviously
once the input is active in software the light becomes green
you adjust this right on the jam using a roller dial
also there arent really any quality digital options that are significantly cheaper
highly recommend the apogee jam
its a midlevel priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals
unless trying to use the jam
it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios
it is bigger than i had imaginedits almost the length of an iphone
feels nice and is very light
the cords arent very long
wow does this stick or what
this tape will definitely fill the requirement
think i ordered it twice
much better than standard industrial strength velcro
just works so what else more can i say
although it does exactly what it says
it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard
this powergrip pedalboard mounting tape is velcro on steroids
this product makes your pedals super secure
once down you can pretty much count on an almost perment mounting
and a hint  some pedals like behringer have a rubber bottom
remove these rubber 34nonskid34 plates because they come off too easily
these take less room  and cut down on the clutter
this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there
it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined
it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface
so this is some good stuff
the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong
the velcro itself is insanely amazing
its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing
once together it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably
i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro
i believe i have been wishing for this for years
i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product
the first two are pretty heavy and bulky
i decided to try out the powergrip and have been extremely impressed
it all came off pretty easily
i then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended
after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured
ive heard that the adhesive doesnt work on rubber wood etc
you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides
get a few rolls as a meter doesnt go as far as youd think
i have never played a string instrument
only problem is the strings
plays 34dead34 meaning it will not stay intune
have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon
this is a great package for beginners
the ukelele   the ukelele looks and feels decent
it has a sticker that says made in china
it comes prestrung but it is out of tune
since the string is nylon i gave it a chance to settle
it could be that the string included is a cheap one
but after 1 song you have to tune it again
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more
that is an easy fix
each song have a chart on which chord you will use
this is a great price for the package
the only downside is that it doesnt stay tuned for very long
we always have to go and retune it which can be frustrating
its not multihundred dollar instrument but for kids and beginners its a good deal
please dont listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldnt keep tune
they dont know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings
you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch
like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient
it only took me about half an hour
these people just do not know how to read
it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight
it is a great buy though considering the price
i highly recommend this product
we learned to play thanks to this kit
the real jewel in the crown tho is the instruction book
it is highly informative easy to follow and has some good songs in it
replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and im glad i did
this is one lush pedal and its all analog
this pedal also sounds great with gain
it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not
this is a great effect
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products have always presented
this analog chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations
you will not be dissappointed at all
it also has a dry through output
the stereo out is very cool for using two amps
i had used some boss ce5 and ch1 and substituted them with this unit
its has a cool analogvintage sound of chours
this cable is an amazing find
there are however a few limitations
this cable is mono only ie not for stereo recording
this cable only works with dynamic microphones
this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software
amazoncomgpproductb000ws1q4e direct box i purchased from amazon as well
the hde xlr to usb is ubs
i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome
so i did thanks hde for wasting my time
go sell your snake oil to someone else
i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc
win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes
i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download
recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all
recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low
usb only provides 5vdc and phantom power usually requires 1848vdc
this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for
it sounded brilliant while it wasnt broken for about the 4 hours of runtime
i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage
needed to get mic into computer via the usb port
amazon had it and at a good price
ill probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon
directions dont include the proper details
i would write them but thats their job
the stand with my guitars looks awesome
its perfect for 23 acoustics and 12 electric guitars
nice addition to my studio
its super cheap and i dont mean the price
came with more parts than what were required
all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra
the guitars do not sit very well in this stand
i will use it until i can find a better one
i really should send this pos back to amazon
the concept is great but the execution of it sucks
it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand
there are better options out there for something portable
this stand is worth 1000 tops
if i had it to do all over i would save my money
i can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand
it is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use
assembly was pretty easy and took little time
still for sanitys sake id position the stand close to a wall
removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort
its simply not sturdy enough physics or no
i love this thing and for the price you just cant beat it
i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for 60 more
like i said for the price you cant beat it
easy to put togetherstable and cheap
i want to get more guitarjust to get a other one
got these stands to hold my guitars they are o
for at home but i really wouldnt recomend them for gigging too much
ill probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that its intact this time
it will mess up the finish
but they just keep making them
anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful
first of all this is a 40 7guitar stand
its not a highend 200 pro stand
that being said the materials are decent
it seems strong and stable
it is not that large and really organizes my instruments
cover them with a sheet or something
this stand is ok for light home use
i would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel
very cheaply made but does the job
guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot
avoid if you can spend more
this has been very helpful for me to check finger position
this has also help me in tuning the violin
this item was purchased because im doing selfteaching on the fiddle
i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions
it did take some measuring to get this in place
i had to be very careful to put it on squarely
the bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut
measuring is best with a cooperative assistant
if you aint intelligent good luck
youd best be served with dot stickers
i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks
this pick is well designed for mandolin playing
unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners
its also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing
having a dozen similara few for me and a few to sharemeets the need
great pick i recommend it
it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin
it also works great for a guitar
this is a good pick
they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely
however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot
after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks
they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison
the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory
so someone messed up in quality control
i think its worth a hundred dollars
i really like epiphone products
they are wellmade easy to play guitars
but i received this uke defective
i just requested a returnexchange from amazon
if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me
i seem to have bad luck with electricacoustic guitars when purchased through amazon
the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture
such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy
sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune
everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable
nice sound in the acoustic too
i absolutely adore this instrument
i would love to have a baritone uku of this same design
dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasnt installed
if i wanted it on there tho its got a peel off sticky back
not having a cable was kinda a big deal
for 100 if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well
i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price
the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options
i like the feel and the control it provides
i like its texture and the size
you get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness
need a little variety in your life
simply a nice assortment of picks to try
worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make
didnt know until i sampled quiet a few
they are picks for guitars and they work
they also have pretty colors
right now i am just writing to get the required words out
if you dont want anything heavy this is good for you
id recommend it for finding what suits you
if youre new it helps you find what you like
50  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i dont use
50 and thicker in case youre looking for very thin ones
if so then dont buy this sample pack
go and buy the dunlop nylon
my favorite pick out of this bunch was  the dunlop jazz 3 pick
this is a pretty decent guitar
if you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board
and a volume nob that goes from low to high
no tone control no presence control
it will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking
this is a great guitar for the money
it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments
i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it
this guitar is pretty good for the price
might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad
i think i may need to tighten some screws
anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical
my c5ce washburn has been a very good purchase
i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one
this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar
top is a bit wavy from buffing
still has some orange peel but not a lot
lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference
i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods
a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar
this is an amazing guitar for the price
i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection
the guitar has good tone and action
the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in
the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud
the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but i prefer the acoustic sound
the finish is a bit more orange than pictured
i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass
i bought these because they were an 34addon34 offer and im glad i did
what can you say about a pick
these picks sound good and have lasted well
i dont often use a pick for my soprano uke
these picks are bigger than i expected
easy to hold and very soft
they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks
i hadnt played any of my string instruments for some time
hence my purchase of these felt picks
these are good but different
we purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the ukulele
not sure i would buy these again
as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings
as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach
they are good for strumming
for lead i needed to use something harder
i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick
for a nice strum these are fine
recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun
these rubber picks metal picks etc
they seem to be made well made
they are larger than i expected and rather thick
heck maybe uke players should try those too
well i guess it works
i dont know what i was expecting
i was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar
234 wide nylon strap is well made comfortable and should last many years
the ends are leather sewn onto the strap
it has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone short or tall
my pet use to roam the car while driving
he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more
they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons
i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
this was something i had to pick up simply due to the price
the reproduction of the sound was very good
this is a great microphone for 10 bucks did i just say 10
every microphone has it uses
ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago
i would recommend for sure
heres a link to an ab comparison i did with an sm57
for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need
the sound is unbelievable especially at this price
for under twenty dollars this pylepro mike cant be beat
this mic is good considering the price
does it sound exactly like a 57
do it have a decent quality sound
if youre expecting an sm57 then buy an sm57
if you want something close on
a budget this is your mic
great value and good sound
i use to protect my microphones
theyre round and they fit over microphones
work well to stop pops and lisps
have been very happy with them
if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam
otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it
snug fit for my mic
kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen
bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic
these provided an easy inexpensive solution
plus they are all padded afor protection
i couldnt say that i loved it
its only a guitar hanger
it just holds a guitar
if i needed another i would buy this type
i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great
the arms are adjustable so the instrument wont rest on the pegs
the foam is good and the hardware is included
plus the price is great
this will allow me to show off and protect them
its easy to install very tough and i love how it looks
i own a number of guitar hangers
this one was a good buy for the money
i dont trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws
i drilled into wooden studs
it is firm secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla
these seem very well made
the prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument
i bought 4 and going back for more
needless to say its not going anywhere
as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall
ill likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts
how self adjusting can they be
easy install and great price
holds neck lightly  easy up easy down
padded so does not scratch finish on neck
good thing i didnt trust the plastic anchors
the anchors stayed in the wall
i found a stud  it works  looks fine
im getting a few more
granted it doesnt look as nice but it does its job
so far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough
and the price is great
the hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability
what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently
if you have a standard size guitar neck dont bother with that
if i buy another it would be a standard hanger
yes i bought 3 and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass
very easy to install on the wall
i just got done installing these
btw this seller really got these to me fast
this was a great buying experience
given to sister from mysel
there is one concern you may have
a total loss  and we had no insurance we sure learned our lesson
so if we can save a few bucks here and there it helps
i bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good
we use those widethreaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall
like i said theyre nothing fancy but they get the job done
i have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio
these did the trick fine
okay they are not high end but i didnt need high end ones
the product arrived within 23 days i couldnt believe how fast it got here
and yet the price is the best part of all
the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly
the screws  anchors are poor
do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only
so i ended up using it to hang my rock band guitar
this 2nd one im using to hang up my beats pros
this is a fantastic product if you understand its limitations
or even headphones that youd like to baby
this is just what i have been wanting for a while now
it works great to hang a standard size guitar on
supports a lot of weight
looks good on any wall
i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application
i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews
i have five guitars including two les pauls and they hold them just fine
i give them four stars
the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke
i have had 34swing trees34 for many guitars for years
comes with wall anchors but i usually look for a stud to mount on
wanted to hang my guitars on the wall
these hooks are padded and rotate a little
provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars
this also provided a additiional 3434 separation from the wall
the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
i love this wall hanging mount
the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described
the arms are adjustable  stay where you put them
i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments
got them in 3 days and love them
so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing
this is a cheaper alternative to the 34string swing34 wall mount considerably less expensive
its easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well
this of course doesnt have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing
for the lower price you get black plastic
but its sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job
if it had sturdier wall mounts id give it 5 stars
so given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem
they all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers
best deal and does the job
the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws
does a shock mount make a difference in sound
a 90 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration
i may tease and say its and award or art piece
addendum 12132011if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection
it also looks great to talent in your studio
over kill or uber cool you decide
looks cool but thats it
would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti
cool design makes a big difference in you audio
even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew
screw is actually two pieces wtf
of worlds crappiest pot metal
supposedly a new tightener design is on the way
this seemed like the best option for that
easy enough as i completed this is one minute
after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great
i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone
it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings
its does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
just as the others have said
its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass
not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars
zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much
i recently purchased a epiphone eb3 bass and it didnt come with a casebag
it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really
i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r16
it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though
im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
this is my first mixer
anyway my pros and conspros1
this thing is way smaller than i expected
it fits well where i put it
i have no hissing and no problems
this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball
i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately
the dials and everything was easy to understand
this needs to be plugged directly into a computer
this highjacks your audio defaults in windows
your sound will come out through your speakers as intended
overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs
worth every penny as long as it lasts
the behringer 302usb premium 5input mixer is just what the doctor ordered
nice unit and works perfectly for vocalsguitar bass guitar and keyboards
i bought this for my son so he could record with it
for a committed neophyte like me the ufo202 was probably sufficient
the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual
but give behringer credit for providing a manual
but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording soundonsound
i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc
over a simple usb headset without 34breaking the bank34
when using with a computer but they dont
so far im getting quality recording results from this board
whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future
i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality
i would give 5 stars but the manufacturer should provide more information
easy to take with you or set on a small shelf
if using usb does not need external power supply
preamp power works well with condenser studio mikes
plug  play with windows 8
didnt have to install any kind of driver
dual track with lowhigh volume sliders
leds make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range
free shipping gotta like thatcons  only one power setting 15v
that may not be enough for some but works great with my studio mike
line in  usb buttons somewhat confusing nonintuitive
however the manual shows exact settings for computer use
can take some fiddling to overcome it
its pretty easy to overpower the computers input and cause distortion
plugged it in worked first time no problems
this unit is very sensitive
with a bit of tweaking is fine for studio work
i use it for guitarvoice solo live internet music shows
overall im quite pleased with the unit
but then its only fifty bucks
i dont know how a pro would rate this
hard to beat at that price
no background hiss very good clear sound crisp no distortion excellent transmission
quite pleased with this little mixerpreamp
it works great and makes this unit portable
there are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the windows handles sound
i have found this to be true
it pretty much takes over your entire sound system
for some folks this will be fine
for others they may not appreciate this
this powers the system without hooking it into the usb system of your computer
this is an excellent alternative to using it as a usb device
thats what i finally did and am still most happy with this device
works very well in this capacity
gotta love those new external usb power nodes
each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply
most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker
speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces
there is however no mounting point  no captive nuts or such
youll need to adopt a philosophy on gain
i will have to fabricate some protection
the speaker w 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it
i do like this set of speakers
from stereo to 51 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs
i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already
sound quality  the bx5 sounds neutral and balanced
the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours
this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver
it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked
that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia
in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection
perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties
so dont buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use
i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure
luckily that was no mere marketing jive
they really are well shielded against rfi
i cant make that claim for prior speakers ive owned
not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips
it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat
however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions
the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl
the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam
and the tweeters sport silk domes
no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors
so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick
while a motu ultralite for mixing  tracking is plugged into the xlr connection
and the bx5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine
arrived fast had them up and running in minutes
the classical musicians in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something
the soundis full and fills the room
i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out
i will preface this review by saying that i am no 34audiophile34
with those goals in mind i was pleasantly surprised how good the bx5 sounded
but the bx5 performs we well or better than i hoped
for guitar playing i use it in close proximity on a desktop
the bass is tight and articulate which is what you want
that wasnt really my goal
there are both xlr and trs inputs on the back
the monitor is powered so theres a power cable as well
there is a volume knob but no independent basstreble adjustment as on other monitors
i bought this for my daughter for christmas
she thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials
in all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick
as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere
i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me
bottom line  every guitarist should have one
this is a wonderful item that really works
having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards
this makes a great gift item
im a pro musician and music teacher
at least thats what it says on his website
im pretty crafty and really like this
ive had one of these for about 2 years now
this is fun and easy to do
i have even sold the picks at garage sales 25 cents each
they most replicate a fender med
most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med
i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results
when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it
i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either
good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner
i have the older version of this as well this newer one
sometimes this new one just wont 34hear34 the string being tuned unless its encouraged
that wasnt the case with the first model
i have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible
it doesnt obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner
thats an a in my book
ive got a 12string acoustic guitar
it truly makes the task many times easier
the display is easy to read
if i had the money id stick one of these on all my guitars
this baby is worth every penny and i highly recommend it to any guitarist
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there
it worked but i dont use it anymore
i put this on my mandolin
not the greatest but ok
pros  fits on any guitar
very easy to hit the wrong one
at shows i rely on a tu2 stompbox for tuning
basically this is a niche tuner
its so stinking small and thats what counts
this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing
just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting
small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading
price cant be beat either
this daddario micro ns tuner tops all those with ease
i have used many clipon guitar tuners
one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on
i have several of them and use them often on many guitars
it tunes nicely and so far as my ear is concerned accurately
others found it awkward to attach  i did not
it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read
what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device
they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible
i leave them on my 12strings and one of the 6s
a nonbuiltinbuiltin tuner at this price cannot be beat
based on this belated realization i have raised the product rating to 4stars
its red when out of tune and green when in tune
it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned
i love it when i am the only one using it
unlike the clamp kind like the snark its hard to share
also i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to
virtually invisible from the front of the guitar
no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery
less gradation in setting than other tuners
debatable  clip mechanism  not spring loaded
this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar
one battery  this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other
when it boils down to it i prefer my old planet waves tuner
for those players bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars
i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments
a great choice for the price
obtained free as part of amazons vine program2
just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen
if its red youre off if its green youre in tune
ive compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and its dead accurate
but its held together fine so far and ive had it for weeks
as a musician im in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner
i got the package of two
unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death
a new battery didnt resurrect it
i couldnt find the other one because theyre small and black
in fact it works really nice
i just decided to eat the loss
im crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last
you can barely tell its there from the front
one thing thats less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself
if youve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean
that way i can look from a distance
at first i didnt like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock
i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag
the tuner has an autoshutoff function to preserve battery life
after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument
as easy as the little round ones from snark
i like those better and theyre cheaper
it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible
there is a metronome function which i havent used
i have another headstock tuner that ive had for awhile
nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions
compared to my other tuner its rigt on the money
this little tuner is sweet
i put it on my stratstyle guitar and it works brilliantly
it is very precise and accurate leading you to perfect tuning every use
i totally recommend this product  you wont be dissappointed
i normally use my korg footswitch tuner for my guitar and basses
this guy really had me believing in smallvibrationtuning
three key words for this  accurate  small  inbeat
but the biggest con is
its pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig
in sunlight its too dim
at home or at a night gig its fine
this works much better in that regard
this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions
it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine
hard to say it just indicates high  low  on pitch really
i prefer the more precise and wider scale 1 readout of the snark
they are much more precise nearly good enough to intonate an instrument
the negatives and why i cant recommend it are as follows
the battery cover on mine fits very loosely
i worry the battery will fall out very easily
i may end up gluing it in place
ok  i like this one a lot
it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime
on tune and back to playing
pros  size size and size
reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some
battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks
on my wifes a style mandolin it fits but barely
on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits
that being said i havent found anything i cant use it on
but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing
over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use
the planet waves pwct12 is my new favorite
it is very small  a little bit larger than a grape
i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the lowe tuner
its so light i dont notice its there
the display is bright and easy to see in most light
bb is displayed as a
the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer
rough handling will probably break it
the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it
it is a ratchet rather than a clamp
for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around
its meant to be left on an instrument
its small enough that you can leave it on in the case
it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget
other reviewers commented on accuracy
if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices
for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display
34 i also prefer the sn2 display
i am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip
i bought this tuner for my mandolin
im pretty fond of this little guy
classical and acoustic steelstring guitars are also a tad problematic too
some headstocks too may be too thick in order to attach this tuner
i primarily play live and i am a toneoholic
no more need for a pedal based tuner
these work that well and are almost undetectable from the front
they also wont mark up your prized instrument
also this tuner is tiny
the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too
almost hard to read tiny
this being said its a nice tuner and stays on
one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ
i like the old version more
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light
my first one arrived not working at all
the second one arrived with a low battery
after three days the battery goes out
i have had plenty of these
it is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly
best ive ever found so far in a tuner
i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out
its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it
update   downgrading my rating by 1 star
with the snark any of them
it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target
seems like it draws current even when its off
i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar
this happened at least three times already
i dont know which one is more accurate
i probably wont buy again for my other and future guitars
i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner
this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice
thats about the only pro
this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini
does it get the job done
it might even be cheaper
update   we received a replacement for this item
the device tunes within 610ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner
our thanks to daddario for their assistance in satisfying this customer
we review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about products
unfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device
our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready
this one seems to consume coincell batteries at an unacceptable rate
on average it eats a battery a day
average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner
i own several small tuners including the enote nano tuner and the snark
anyway it all comes down to preference i suppose
use this on my taylor acousticelectric which does not have a built in tuner
id recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a builtin tuner
i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock
it never needs to be removed
a little background first i guess
i also have a boss tu3 pedal tuner
he was not incredibly pleased with it
enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves
lets just say this id never gig with this guy as my only tuner
its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use
all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark
i know theyre more expensive but youll be happier off in the long run
but it may not hold up forever
this little tuner is excellent
i have other tuners but this one is the best
i didnt realize it was so small
i was concerned when i first open the package because of its size
but this mini tuner is just plain amazing
im glad i bought it
this tuner is tiny and accurate
i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp
but i do like the rotation of the display
otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me
dark grey letters on a light grey screen
not impossible but not terribly convenient either
looks more professional and i like that
this unit is very small and tucks away nicely
it is easy to use
i would recommend this to anyone
first it tunes very accurately
third buy it if you are looking for a new tuner
i really like this tuner
i have always liked the planet waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy
i currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate
another winner from planet waves
cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele
small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners
as a tuner i really like it
the problem is its just not responsive enough
that may seem like a small issue
but not if you use such a device regularly as many homeplayers do
myself i have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall
that doesnt make this valueless
thus i give it 3 stars
so bottom line im not impressed
these arent an expensive tuner comparatively speaking and thats good
but they really dont do all that great a job
theres simply no place to clip it
i just put theplanet waves pwct12 ns mini headstock tuneron my stratocaster last night
it is sensitive and accurate
this tuner works by guitar vibration
not recommended for band environments
probably ok for solo gigs or home practice
otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
easily installed on my parlor guitar
the oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl
installation is not rocket science
i used to use schaller straplocks but theyre not compatible with all straps
if the end leathermaterial is too thick the lock wont fit
it comes with two buttons two washers and 4 screws two different sizes
item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set
looks good on my yamaha acoustic guitar
i am happy i bought this
i must first state for the record i hate strap locks
hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually
ive never met a set i liked in any single way
ive only ever dropped an instrument that had strap locks on it
schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with locktite
duncan type often suffer from nonpositive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed
and then there is the the metalonmetal clankyness
oh and and the cost
why are these little elliptical end pins so brilliant
they are not strap locks
sometimes the simplest design is the best design
talk about a false sense of security
these strap pins are fantastic
they securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely
the oval shape is perfect
there is no need for proprietary or expensive strap locks
they are easy to install
these elliptical pins are great
i highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar
i will never use strap locks again after trying these
i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar
these work great and look sweet too
high quality product and very easy to install
brilliant solution to the strap button problem
works as well as locking strap buttons did for me
i like these little guys
used on my acoustic guitar
pro removes friction for faster playing
i noticed immediate result after applying first time
enhances string life and tone
i guess there was some mild crud buildup you cant see
not completely gone but lessened
con packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks
has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesnt prevent dry out
i dont believe i would buy again until a sealed container is provided
i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts
the perfect wall mount for a ukulele
i dont know why others rated it as a 4 star
it is exactly what it says it is and works fine
im a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars
call me a satisfied customer
this is not an easy fix but it is doable
just like the ones in the store
we mounted our two ukes on these
put our hangers in studs but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall
heavy duty and nice looking
you just cant beat the speed and convenience of amazon
great deal for the price
did the job for what i needed
now i know i would love a better one like a fishman
this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping
does not scratch guitars finish just be careful and no issues
a great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric
this pickup is actually a really great product for what it is
its nuts being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic
this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric
works really well considering how inexpensive it is
very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound
very high gainfits in all size soundholes
of course its not great
im not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself
i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup
its just a matter of how much you want to or can spend
im happy with this pickup
for 2000 it is worth all day
ive used my hde pickup for about a month now
i use it with a fender frontman amp
the sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost
i highly recommend this product
for the price it is a good deal
i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did
does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound
i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have
i have had no problems with them
i use this on all my guitars
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
they worked well and were easy to install
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
this made me take a second look at schaller
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
i just bought a rickenbacker 4003 that came with schaller strap locks preinstalled
sounds great easy to adjust
nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board
it only works with a power adapter no battery
this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so i returned it
does a good job for a basic delay
good for rockabilly and 50s slap echo
i needed it for nothing else so im happy
you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs
dont waste your  on others with similar specs
just got it so far so good
i use delay pretty light n tight  slapback vibe not too wet
this modtone here seems solidly constructed
i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes
good tone though does the trick trick
good design easy to hang on to these picks
reasonable price makes it even better
i dont often use picks but when i do i use these
i will buy more in the future
now we have the beehold picks
i found running leads  scales with this pick to be a delight
bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome
i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most
however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
i have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus
this holder grips the ipad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue
i could not order that arm separately
then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag
i would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose
very durable and light weight
someday i may use it on stage
its made in germany so it could be taken into battle
my ipad lives on this thing
i do wish it could rotate both directions
but if you sleep on the left youre gonna have a bad time
this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does
this stand does the trick
i dont have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand
i have not found that to be true
since ive had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it
a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic
the only drawback is you cant have your ipad in a case
or you have to find a case thats ultra thin
its very articulate and gives you good marshally 70s80s crunch
cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound
its almost odish in its responsiveness
its not super heavy distortion though
for the price its amazing
this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box
i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal
when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal
i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo
this has the most distortion
it is solidly built and apprears road worthy
great pedal and great value
great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal
knobs and switch are sturdy
this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped
unity is around 8 oclock on the level knob
it gets thumbs up for the soundprice ratio
this joyo jf03 crunch distortion pedal is just amazing
cfhevaluation unit provided by manufacturer
not bla bla bla this joyo pedals are the best any you get
thank u joyo im your number 1 customer
good   plenty of gain on hand
this thing can get really loud
it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch
built well its casing is made out of metal not plastic
you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise
it doesnt happen when i boost my overdrives ocd  hardwire cm2
i guess this is typical for distortion boxes
it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones
very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure
for 30 there is no reason not to try it
you wont be disappointed if you do
it offers rugged construction and true bypass
i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin
it really will produce marshall plexi tones
especially noticeable in the lower registers
on the e and a strings
and they all are super
plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see
the pedal cuts through and is articulate
its not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock
think acdc and van halen to metallica
its a classic rock pedal that screams
this pedal is very easy to use
retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied
according to the ad copy this pedal replicates fullstack marshall crunch
as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that
what im loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like
dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up
individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion
its a great pedal period
its a darn guitar miracle at 40
my hats off to joyo
buy one youll use it youll love it youll be happy you bought it
i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from
there is no difference in the sound at all
this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box
it does 80s hair band and 80s metal very well
it nails those sounds well
jcm800 in a 30 dollar box
you cant really get there without actual tubes being distorted
to me the hot plexi sounds more real closer than this
that being said this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi
ive reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them
this pedal has an extremely high output
also i read several comments here that this isnt a high gain distortion
this thing has tons of gain
my level is usually around 25 to 40 and is still very loud
again this is with les paul humbuckers
but thats an 80 custom shop pedal from mxr
so i agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid
however i like to play at a substantially high volume for recording
to my surprise i hear radio noises
i tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards
sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications
this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money
so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone
i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one
i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion
see my other reviews on these pedals
basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer
the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween
it is built solidly and looks roadworthy
it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great
i would have no issue gigging with this unit
lots of sounds in this unit
much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned
for classic rock  this is perfect
this pedal lives up to the hype
i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one
the jf02 is a really nice dirtbox  and not just for the price
i have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here
most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass
this incredible inexpensive box really nails it
the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff
the power jack however leaves a little to be desired
ive now secured it with tape so it should be ok
the joyo ultimate overdrive is simply a great pedal
the bright switch is an added bonus
having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal
this one is a winner hands down
i know tone and have had great and not so great gear
this one is a keeper
whats not to like here
forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal
has more low end and a smoother mid that the ocd
i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals
i have to say that i am fairy impressed
i really liked this one
sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound
buy thisthese pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny
and botique quality at paupers price
true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo
no way this thing cost lest than 40
this compares very closely to my high end od pedals i own
im super happy with my joyo pedals
this is a pretty hot pedal
great price and well made
i did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good
you have to try it to believe it
otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars
thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive
amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs
how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me
the english instructions arent really useful as the pedal itself is selfexplanatory
im possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20 years
your attitude and hands create the sound in the end
a pedal does not make you play better practice does
cool looking pedal box to boot
bought this instead and it plain rocks
this thing stands up nicely on all three
sounds amazing in any combo
using it as my gain along with the joyo vintage od for lead boosts
the tone none the less is very usable and sounds great
ive had this for nearly a year and i have no complaints
lots of gain tons more than my boss sd1 wthe monte allums sd808 mod
if lost or stolen id buy another
lets get a few things straight from the start  i love effects pedals
the star of the joyo lineup however is arguably the jf02 ultimate drive
with the exact same settings the fulltone will actually sound much brighter
it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel
aside from that this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit
its not a metal type distortion but it nicely covers everything else
and the ultimate drive does it nicely
driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones
it gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone
i cant think of any other pedals ive owned that could do this
put this through an ac30c2 and prepare to be amazed
never owned an ocd but i dont need to
my neighbors im sure are not pleased
its your guitar on steriods
crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it
thats at the 25 gain setting
flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls
from nasty blues to steppenwolf you will have it covered
people say its an ocd clone
all in all im happy with it
knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones
the jf02 is truly my favorite right now
it serves up great tones into either one
the joyo is an exact clone of the tech 21british pedal which costs 189
i dont know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not
after trying for a couple of hours i find that it wont do that
nothing but praise goes to the supplier  kdm distributors
they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country
but the pedal itself not for me
this pedal solved my problem with my amp
it needs to be in front of a tube amp
this one is easy  buy it
ive owned many effects over 32yrs playing
i now rate it at 5 stars
does the british sound succeed at that goal
on the other three joyo sound pedals the opposite is true
at this price hard to complain too much
for a cheap pedal i gave this a try
can get many different types of sounds and drive from it
the knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough i guess
i like much more than the joyo fuzz
this can give some cleans and drive to distortion
certainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal i have used
but for the budget i do receomend it
it is cheap and very has a good range of tone options
not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out
great variety of uses for it
i like the layout of controls as well
other then that nothing id change
theyve got a great product for the price point
as with any pedal it wont make you a better player
i intentionally got the jf02 after reading positive reviews all over the net
the jf15 was a curiosity purchase
the reviews on all joyo products are extremely polarizing
first a word about joyo
but again reasonable minds can differ
my primary concern is  how does the pedal sound
the answer to that question is surprisingly good
there are two ways to think of this pedal
the switch is a click metal button similar to those used on mxr pedals
this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board
constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough
i like it with the power supplyno batteries to fuss with
wow i am very surprised by this pedal
i didnt realize everything else this pedal can do
i tried it on bass and was really impressed
phantom power would be nice then also
it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac30
the name is somewhat misleading
although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction
not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer
this pedal is an audio swiss army knife
i love the sound of this pedal
its as versatile as can be
if you want to sound like 5 dimebag darrels then dont buy this pedal
if you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you
i employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortionsoverdrives
for an inexpensive unit this thing rules
i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp
the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind
i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite
it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar
buy the pedal its great
wow is all i can really say
this ranks right up there as the best money i ever spent on equipment
this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used
for direct recording it does
if used with an amp maybe
but however you use it it is sweet
no pedal including a 200 boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies
as for the sound of the pedal its very good
the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp
the voice knob is hard to describe
let me start by saying
i used to work for line 6 so i know modeling pedals
there wasnt a 150 difference
very convincing and just 40
i have yet to try this through a loop
i bought this to tune my 12string without using the end jack
i use it on chromatic but it includes  bass uke and guitar too
easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments
for the price i am very pleased
i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time
i know it will live up to the finder name
easy to use and the clip is sturdy
a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it
i bought two of these
small but well lighted screen
very quick reaction to string
i liked it from the very first tuning
it is small and doesnt look like a huge lump on the headstock
operates with one 3v 2032 battery included
5 stars because it works as its described and has a nice display
i like this better than my old snark
its got a better build quality than the snark for sure
super tight and very accurate
im not a fenfer fan but i really love this tuner
i recommend this one to anyone
i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones
both of my snarks have broken off at this joint
this fender tuner is a great alternative
so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented
however for the home player this tuner will work just fine
the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be
it is smaller than a snark but not by much
i think what happened is i just left it on too long
since it died that first time it doesnt seem to perform the same
i wouldnt recommend against this product
just remember to hold the power button to turn it off
this does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment
this is my first electric tuner
i grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed
can tune several different instruments
i have several of these
personally i prefer the snark tuner but these are a fairly close second
the display is large and bright
oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound
but the more i use it the better feel i get for it
if you dont have one get one
this little guy worked just as advertised
super easy to use and a musthave for anybody who gigs out
overall great deal for the price
count on fender to give u a good product
i bought two for 10 bucks each
they work great on my acoustic and electric guitars
the only thing i would do to improve is add an off button
the only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life
this is a great little tuner and i am glad i bought it
this is a great tuner if you know what you are using it for
now could you use it for a gig
for the price it cant be beat
great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar
it let me know that i am not a techy
for me not so easy to get beyond the basics
it does a nice clean job for the recording i have gotten done
the unit is simple to use and the builtin microphones do a great job
ive only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic
ill update this review after ive had some more time with it
honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing
and why is the lineout so darn noisy
gonna have to send this back
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
their differences for your  ears
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
not really that good for  music
can be done but not as good
if you use ext mic
u wont be happy either
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
only slightly better than 05
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
this can be used to  semi  record music too
so testing on their own mics
that last one was far far better than the first two
means only that dr 40
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
upon comparing the resulting  cds
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
b  recorded dr40 printed to cd
my budget must be tripled at least
and then to go out to test some more
no cheap way is there
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
i bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project
this is an absolutely wonderful recorder
the tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement
it does a fantastic job
i am starting out learning to play guitar
im running windows 7 64bit and everything installed flawlessly
the included ableton live 8 lite software recognized the unit as well
im looking forward to using the scarlett more to improve my guitar playing
purchased to provide professional level io for recording from mixers etc
output of high quality material also sounds superb
and compares well with other very high quality gear
drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly
re computers and drivers  almost all the tests went well
one of these recorded perfectly also
this issue is why four starts rather than five
so for linux users this may be a very attractive option
however i have a few gripes with the 2i2
this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance
but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls
the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before
or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it
nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though
so in the end 45 stars
overall great entry level interfacesound card
this audio interface is fantastic
the sound quality is great
all in all if you need a budget system at home  get this
it is perfect for mac or pc
i had alesis io2 express which did a similar job
but after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video i finally broke down
i heard more definition with the guitar
now that i have it i take the quality for granted
it has higher quality and the dials feel solid
the little limiter lamp is awesome
im very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job
ive been using ableton for 4 years and it never crashes
im using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation
we have used this with an at2020 at2021
sm58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high
the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions
simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding
this little fellow is great
the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box
hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro
everything else plugs right in
no hassle with the right jacks and stuff
i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program
ive been recording using garage band
there are two ports for speakers on the back side i havent used yet
just trying to decide what speakers to purchase
i use this little guy in connection with my daw and digital piano
i purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the behringer uf0202
the balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems
this was a good purchase
its a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well
further its class complaint so you dont have to use behringers drivers
to let you know what i need in an interface 1
volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4
the good this box is simple and welldesigned
it does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality
im pleased with the digitaltoanalog conversion
it has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp
it has switches so each input can be a linein or microphone preamp
it has a switch for zerolatency monitoring of whatever is coming in
the headphone amp was of particular concern for me
the behringer headphone amp was only ok
specifically it has an output impedance of 50 ohms
breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response
in my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass
most manufacturers dont list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed
anyway focusrite does which is one reason i trust them a little more
the output impedance is less than 10 ohmsrespectable but not amazing
theres lots of gain available
i have them turned all the way down almost
the outs are trs style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back
the usb cable is just a type b port
this means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever
the behringer for example was hardwired to its cable
i really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware
the bad the driver for this thing is horrible under windows xp
i mean my computer is really stripped down
performance using the behringer was good
at that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy
i installed it and it worked
the output latency was a tiny 43 ms only
3 of which are actually output latency so this is really impressive
the bad news is that this configuration is very buggy
i have to do this every time i turn on the computer
we are talking about major bugs here
tried rebooting a few more times still didnt work
so i uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software
at first it didnt work
i hope you are getting the idea
a monkey could have written a better driver
i would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical
the good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them
closing thoughts unfortunately there really isnt a usb interface that has a good driver
thats about as trouble free as ive seen in this type of device
horrible horrible drivers that never get fixed
maybe its better under mac
interestingly this is really the only usb 20 device in this range
thats quite shocking considering how long the usb 20 standard has been around
theres not enough throughput in usb 11
so in light of the competition the focusrite looks kind of ok
at least the hardware in this one is up to spec
we can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future
bottom line  this is a fantastic 5star device
if you can make the software work consistently
they are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers
the new driver actually works
i have stopped using asio4all and i get decent latency
if i dont change anything most of the time it works ok
if you have issues with the driver definitely update
i write and record my own music
the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box
i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great
just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
small amazing good quality interface
i especially like the dual inputs on front
back light on knobs shows clipping on volume green and red and connected green
usb powered and plug and play
my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds
and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface
you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time
and shouldnt recording be fun and not frustrating besides
so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper
dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface
and on the downside made in china
after reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what i needed
its small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk
its got some solid pres and has enough for me to work with
phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful
and the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other
all in all id say the design of this is very user friendly
im using windows and i have to suggest using the asio drivers whenever possible
could be my system could be the preamp otherwise no complaints
though be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software
well built easy setup very quiet
ive used more than a handful of usbfirewire interfaces over the past decade
in the past its always been a crapshoot regardless of brand or reputation
instability incompatability and frustration abound with audio interfaces
that being said this has been the best interface ive ever owned
its performed flawlessly since day one
regarding sound quality my recordings have never sounded better
im seriously impressed with the quality
the drivers gave me no hassle installing and as i said above rock solid
same setup same hardware etc and one person can have wildly differing results
the 2i2 is a simple setup
ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly
and purchased a license for reaper
now im in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers
that is just unbelievable in my eyes
besides that ill more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers
this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 14 instrument ins
how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating
the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm
sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here
it takes a while for the shipping but thats stated in the description
i would recommend this capo
it works and does at it is supposed to
i have no issues with quality or feel its too loose
this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar
he has enjoy and likes using the capo
arrived as expected and as described
capo is well made and is very well priced
i am very happy with the purchase
how far wrong can you go for 183
i can give these away to beginners that dont have a capo
if you really want a capo get a keyser or other decent capo
this item did the job its made for
does it damage your instrument
im going to get another one before they decide to raise the price
switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly
just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more
i have to type more
it looks and fits just as shown in the picture
not much you can say
the headline says it all
shipping takes time but for the price who cares
i ordered two just in case
but it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all
but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done
my old cable was stiff and unruly
this one is not so stiff and is very well built
is a nice cablegod quality  as always with the fender brand
this cable arrived today and i am still in shock
this amp cable is perfect
it fits my need for practicing
its just the right length for sitting on the couch strumming daily
i will buy some more of these
the cable also looks nice and completes the fender look
i would highly recommend this and give it a nobrainer 5 star rating
i have nothing negative to say about this
i have used these without any problems whatsoever
as expected for a beginner
im just learning what i want and what i need
this cable works fine for my needs right now
i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture
it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
what can you say about a guitar chord
i was surprised howsturdy it appears
it works awesomely and its not a bad price for name brand cables
nice lookingnice sound and quality to these cables
they are what i needed
thank you godps for making such good quality products
im pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years
at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months
i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these
there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too
got this for my electric guitar
every part of these cables are quality
does what its supposed to do
pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to
im not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagonwheel
these picks are the bomb
tip  these picks are great for high actionhigh gain guitar solos
i play bass with these and they have a unique tone
the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music
makes rotosound strings really sound off
while the product is everything it said it would be
i was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin
just was not what i was hoping for
these are a little course for what i wanted
brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking
there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm
they are a little flimsey but are ok
it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow
not to mention that its hard to strum and sounds awful
what these picks are good for is leads
rock metal shredding and even country
the sound is short with a very high tone pitch
switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull
also these picks have a noslip grip
it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick
i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick
i saw this and had to try it
havent tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too
anyway these are great guitar picks if youre looking for something solid and longlasting
if you want to spice up your board go for some color
at this price these cables are a bargain
ive used this to connect several devices and the colors help
i would recommend this and the quality is good
good quality seem durable enough
good deal on this package of patch cords
they work just as well as the more expensive ones i have used
i like the length too
these patch cords work like a champ
i use them with my pedal board and havent any issues with signal quality
they give some versatility in their length
i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much
ok theyre a little odd but for the price i dealt with it
that being said they also dont cost 70
can i hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones
because i wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors
i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they dont disappoint
theyre fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying
ive been using them for 6 months or so
otherwise pick these up  great price and certainly gets the job done
they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine
will and have used it since
to top it all off the price is right
the quality of the screen is very good
i wont hold it against these windscreens
the product is here and i am glad the size is right
the colors punch out nice and will1
help my vocal mics last longer so singers dont drool on my mics
34hey can we get blue turned down a little
i will update if that matters in the long run
and my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs
im not going to recommend this over the 15 capos
but once its on it works
easy to get on and off
seems to be sturdy and well built
best of all the price
the capo looks nice and works without any problem
you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff
this is not my only capo but its my cheapest
it works as well as other more expensive ones
this one was a good deal through amazoncom
cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist
it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive its almost painful
when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully
this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there
even a professional would appreciate this capo
it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right
this is a good quality capo
i ordered two of this item on 0318
i used it in acoustic guitar and on the ukelele without any problem
it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away
i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts
i got this because of the price
i dont know if its going to last me a while
but it does its job
works fine on some guitars
the neck has to be thinner though
id pay for a better one if i had to get another
that being said that person probably isnt playing much guitar
this is a great capo
i like it and it was well under the price of others
this is a pretty good nonexpensive capo
you can spend more but this does what you need it to do
got these because i wanted some extra capos around
good deal as backup capos
it was my favorite capo
someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment
had to buy another one
the capo is made of metal and works well
it does what it is suppose to do
i would buy this again
a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made
i dont think that you would go wrong
feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise
does what its supposed to do so far
ok this thing is cheap
but a cheap item you cant use is money thrown away
well i want to clear this up once and for all
this thing really is a puzzler
someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid
purchased for hanging two rockband pseudo guitars
works great for that and for uke
would also be ok with guitars
for the cost these are a smoking deal
this is thus far a good bargain
i have used it to hang a 12 heavy string
ill use a stand if im going to use a guitar often
the 34fingers34 will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly
like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa
this one looked sturdy enough
and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweighthollowbody electric
it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules
i bought this for my acoustic
bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo 6
holds my bass guitars easily as well
the design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on
mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit
there is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke
glue and a rubber band now holds it together
i own a red blue and now a black one
this one is the best yet
however it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim
when it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner
i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and its the same
we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner
i used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly
that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune
i love the little thing
a couple tips to tuning a guitar  tune it like you play it
if you strum  play softly then pluck  tune each string softly
so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat
also please check your intonation
your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings
you pluck your open string hard  tune as described above
please dont pay someone to setup your guitar
you can do it yourself so easily
the first 3 saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down
if not break out your philips head  tweak your intonation
i love this little tuner
im planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case
best tuneri have owned for the price
this is the new and improved snark
so the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens
however the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws
for a clipon you cant beat the accuracy this little unit gives you
i had the red snark and a couple others
this one is the best ive tried so far
no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning
6 stars if they had it that high
the snark sn8b is my favorite so far
again its a clipon tuner so dont expect razorsharp accuracy
but it does a good enough job for what it is
if you need something more accurate i recommend investing in a good pedal
i dont typically use the metronome feature but its nice to have it
overall my favorite snark model and my favorite clipon tuner
not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well
i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar
furthermore they are very accurate as well
bottom line  inexpensive wellmade accurate timesaving
i cant see how they could improve this at all
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment
sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string but generally works great
can tune up quickly every time
i feel the display is an improvement  easy on the eyes
hopefully more reliable than sn2
too soon to tell if the sn8 will hang in there
dont know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat
no big deal i just tune it at 12th fret
could choose any note since its chromatic
this guitar tuner is simply amazing
never using another tuner again in my life
very good for a quick tune up
might be a little to tight for checking intonation
very fast readout and fast on off
this is one great piece of equipment
adding to that is its convenient small size and being unbelievably cheap price
why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning
this tuner really delivers its inexpensive and accurate  much better than the sn1
i use mine with ukulele and guitars and both get tuned accurately with it
i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner
i narrowed it down to 3  korg aw2 snark sn1  intelli imt900
snark claims that its their best tuner yet
i took the plunge and ordered one
i have only 2 requirements for a tuner 1
the snark sn8 delivered on both counts and more
the sn8 is small  unobtrusive
after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case
i dont like it hanging in my guitar
of course it doesnt stay long because it tunes fast
for under 20 these little tuner is all you need
try it you wont be disappointed
i own at least 8 of these
i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele
for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
i have reviewed this before
i like it works really well
i am very careful how i adjust and have had no problems
i have tried the intel krog boss etc
and out of all of them i like the snark the best
response and visual display are awesome
you cant go wrong with any snark
these tuners just seem ok to me
i still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner
the accuracy in my opinion just isnt there
still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing
bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions
fast response on all strings including the low b on several five string basses
turning it on though the display is quite different
basically it is much more to the point
the downside is it is not granular enough to say intonate an instruments bridge
it seems much more twitchy than the sn1
the differences here between the sn8 and sn1 are quite noticeable
for that reason i just ordered another sn1
all i know is that it just isnt working very well for me
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
it has less granularity in the display for example
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
and the result sounds really right
i think ill be putting one of these on most instruments from now on
from the front you can barely notice it at all
love it love it love it
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
as far as the sn8 is concerned
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
new tuners like the snark sn8b are a joy in comparison
the only complaint ive heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight
if the battery dies they are tone deaf
no this tuner is not super tight
its ok but not super tight
i bought this because the tuner in the rp1000 is pretty sloppy
its good for a laugh
i would suggest the snark sn1
its cheaper and works very well
this is very accurate and also very easy to use
it is accurate reliable for tuning and affordable
all that said here is why i decided to write a review
the unit itself is great
one for the electric one for the acoustic etc
this item does not travel well and is best used at home gently
tried this and was not happy
seemed to want to be off too much
got the fender ft004 instead
i would try the fender
if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner
i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing
the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold
all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand
i have had 2 of these tuners youd think id learn after one
to me for the price its made cheaply
try daddario instead love their tuners
it would just be nice if it included one is all
why are you still reading this
this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great
it alows you to fine tune each string
i have four snarks and one other brand
the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display
tuning is quick and simple
this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought
why buy this after the experience of the others
this one has a great display  full colour and easy to read
a im very impress with the precition of this tuner
its very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar
even using a capo 100 recommended
battery is included also so you can use it right out the box
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel correctly
i got about three of them
i had to get used to this tuner at first
i have used a different brand up until this purchase
an experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me
this is a very useful tuner since its small fast and pretty rugged
ive dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubberylike casing
i have an older model that i still use also
the bars are easy to see and are accurate
really efficient way to go in my opinion
this is the newer version of the original snarks
i have bought the red blue and older black models
fast and reliable and accurate
i cant recommend these enough
it does its job and its well worth the money
for 13 its hard to say anything bad about this gadget
this is handsdown the best tuner ive ever owned
this little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate
it simply does its job and does it very well
i bought this for a friend whos previous tuner was lost
other than a great display and accurate tuning
this is made with a moveable arm between the tuner and the clip
i wasnt expecting it to be this nice
nice and bright easy to see
had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars
remember its a guitar tuner not an impact wrench
seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price
if you can wait for the delivery its a no brainer
something about eb strings they really are slinky  whatever that means
they have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better
plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands
ive tried many others but always come back to ernie balls
i play and practice a lot and i abuse strings
these can take it and come back for more
i got this for our church
i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall
musicians gear tubular guitar stand black pair is a good deal for musician
these stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced
holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well
had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened
these are solid stands for holding your guitars
they are an excellent value
they help me pick up my guitars much more often
i highly recommend these for around the house use
cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far
i bought a couple of these two years ago
they are a sturdy but lightweight stand
the small footprint is nice for those with limited space
i use for both electric and acoustic guitars
the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not
the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support
the rubber feet are also smaller
i didnt notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported
there may be a concern about damage to certain finish
i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material
i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass
these things work really great
it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue
and the ukulele looks so much better now
if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise
just remember the key words  slow and gentle
dont force anything and you should be fine
upon arrival i was astonished
plugged in it really shines
if youre hemming and hawing over getting one just do it
youll be oh so pleasantly surprised
i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center
then i saw this one
i enjoy playing this thing so much
its reasonably quiet acoustically but it shines when plugged in
the tuners are basic but they work well
it is thinner than a normal uke about half the body depth
mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket
this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds
change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument
amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too
only drawback  there is no volume control on the instrument itself
the action was a little high for my taste
the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible
why do they sell an instrument with crap strings
otherwise its well built and works
and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul
but the reviews were telling a different story
still hoping for that harley though
i just love it now
when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill
i really dont see how gibson can make and sell these for 99
the tech at the guitar shop cant see how either
i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects
i was really surprised to see how well they sounded
im not a guitar player so this uke is just a toyexperiment for me
if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route
if you just want to play around a little this uke will do
that huge box is then inside yet another huge box
honestly to protect this better theyd have had to contact tony stark
it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping
5 stars on that alone
i like that its a bit larger than a 2021 soprano uke
it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano
frankly id like to see a baritone version
from stern to port this instrument shines
the whole unit is heavywood and very durable
nevertheless the sound is quite good
the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well
the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes
the ampjack is chromemetal backplated to the body its not coming loose
strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle
the action is fairly high not uncommon with offtheshelf instruments
that counts for the gig bag too
no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing
a good instrument is worth protecting
weird suggestion   hang on to the box it comes in
it makes a great temporary hard shell case
that is some stiff cardboard
they could have done better on that end
but wow at this price how can one gripe
2 put a preamp on this
you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks
if you have a minimixer you can do the same thing with that
even with that little extra expense youll come out ahead
aside from the passive electronics
this is a prime instrument
considering what you get for the price
i dont think this can be beat
unfortunately my extralong fingers find this very difficult to play
something i didnt consider when ordering a uke
but thats a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument
the product itself is excellent
this is a great deal for two microphone stands
several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning
these should last a long time as long as theyre not abused
these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well
easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em
this microphone stand it a fairly good buy
adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone
as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal
received these with lightining speed
great for singing micing amps and such
these are 3999 each at a local music store so
i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had
to be honest im not missing anything
they have all the features and versatility youll ever need
perfect for what i want to do
they even come with a clamp for your cable
the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend
all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue
it was a total waste of money but doesnt pay to return it
again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands
replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand
but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk
was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised
great quality an very robust
im very happy with this set
they do make noise kind of like an old album
once you start playing you dont notice it though
i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar
i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap
the fender and the deans were very nice
this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well
i couldnt figure out the different tunings on it though
it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle
i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal
the other ones must be for some special type of music
but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the deans
it is also very easy to hold unlike the deans i have found
all in all a very nice bargain
but hey they work so why change them
the neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing
it really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar
you can get a lot more for your money these days
all in all this is a great guitar for a great price
my upgrades if any will be new pots caps wiring nut perhaps tuners
no need to replace these pickups
i say this one just may be a keeper
ive been so impressed by epiphones but this one didnt do it
quality of manufacture and assembly great
pickups far less than inspiring
yes its a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound
just didnt have the tone and bite i was expecting
roll of the dice i guess
i have spent a good month with my new guitar and i am impressed
upgrade it to something better
your strings will thank you
oh and this goes without saying upgrade the stock strings
these were just what i needed
some of them had the white dot some didnt therefore they didnt look uniform
with these pins the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it
fit my 12 string with no problems
they arent bone brass wood pearl dont expect them to be
its awesome to use and efficient
the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are
to my ear it sounds good but you never know
this is my new favorite tuner
i plan on buying these for all my guitars
it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning
i use mine all the time between different alternative tunings
a great investment unless you have a perfect ear
lately its become my goto tuner
this is not just a tuner  its a peacekeeper for our band
arguing over tuning can really take up time
excellent product though the metronome is of no value but thats not important
good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around
the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs
i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly
the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it
i only use the clean side or input one
this is what fender calls blaceface clean
i really havent used channel two much
these are all your presets which many amps are doing these days
im pretty much old school and like to find my own sound
the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on
its a loud 15 watts
i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems
if your looking for a studiohome1st amp you cant go wrong with this guy
its now my go to amp in the studio
right now this amp doesnt need to be tweaked for me
i loved it right out of the box
give it a test drive and let your ears decide
this is the greatest practice amp ever
and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band
first its all tube so it sounds really good
it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast
second its 15 watts and is pretty darn loud
at a bar youll probably need to mic it or use the included lineout
thatll make it loud enough for most bars
fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything youll need
most small tube amps dont have built in effects
with this amp everything is built in
fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet
sixth the price is amazing
all tube build in effects and line and speaker out
fender is basically giving these things away
but considering the price thats understandable
youll only want the cover and footswitch if youre playing in a band
first some clarification is needed on 34tube34 vs
overall i found the available tones to be excellent
but again the amp is plenty loud and fullsounding for its size
frankly im not a fan of most onboard effects with combo amplifiers
i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrivedistortion
you can also reassign the presets to different effects
the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects
the build quality of the super champ x2 is largely excellent
but overall the amp looks very well constructed
it sounds great right out of the box
i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes
if you mic up this will work for small gigs
the build seems very good
i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised
all and all a super practice amp or micable performance amp
ps  i dont review products that dont stand out as excellent
it is accurate  very reasonably priced
best clip on tuner i have ever purchased
lightweight small simple to use and its easy to read in broad daylight
cant ask for much more in a tuner
makes me feel good inside to look at it
will work on any instrument
you dont need the expensive ones this works just fine
just wish the batteries lasted longer
for the money there isnt a better tuner on the market today
this tuner is spot on every time and super fast
you can move from string to string quick
let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
it has less granularity in the display for example
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
and the result sounds really right
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
as far as the sn8 is concerned
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
i have the snark 2 but read that this was the best so far
i got and agreethis works better
i would recommend it to anyone
i love this new one
its a bit easier to see the display
these little tuners are amazing
so easy to use and portable and cheap
i have several now one for every guitar
i also received one without a battery which upset me at the time
i am in afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by
snark tuners have always performed well for me
i play guitar and ukulele
ive used and own many tuners and brands
the snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat
for anyone who plays acoustic guitar  these things are so handy
when the unit first arrived i was concerned because the box had been damaged
it shipped in an envelop
however once i opened it i discovered an undamaged snark tuner inside
when i put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly
it clips to my guitar strong and stays put
im very pleased with the unit
works very smoothly and doesnt eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners
i just got my snark tuner and im very impressed with it
it attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar
it is far superior to previous tuners ive used
they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with
i have lots of tuners and several brands of clip ons
there is no close second
these snark tuners are really cool
it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes
it was cheap and affordable
originally i bought another snark and liked it well enough
id seen this one on youtube and thought its little bobble head looked
ill look silly if it lets me stay in tune
the builtin metronome doesnt have a lot of volume but its clearly visible
warranty runs for a year
altogether im very satisfied with this tuner
ive used a variety of tuners
however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several
i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners
also it may be a litle larger than some like
this is my second and i love them so much
they work flawlessley and tune is amazing
this is a nifty little tuner
i just leave it on my telecaster
this little tuner is made to be left on one guitar
we got this one for my wifes mandolin
its small barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back
the accuracy is as good or better than any ive used
cons i wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me
it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too
easily worth the extra dollar
that also means a bigger readout
so not really a con
should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it
ive been a musician for over 40 years
ive seen an awful lot of products come and go
i dont get excited about the latestandgreatest very easily
i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more
planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff
this item is definitely in the good quality family
not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument
i bought a few for different basses and guitars
the switch should be on the side of the unit
fwiw i like my snarks better
faster and more stable tuning
a near miss with the ns
this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics
i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up
great for a quick look in between songs
when i first installed these strings i wasnt too impressed
i mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do
its not necessarily a bad different its just slicker and not as coiled feeling
hard to describe but if youre used to playing nickle youll notice the difference
honestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune
these really are a good set of strings
if you try them just make sure to give them time
they get better with wear
but i do feel confident in what i report here
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
a lot of harmonics and output captured
for that 5 stars easy
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
others may feel differently i am sure
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
so you are getting what they say
average to 3 i guess
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
i also really like the daddario pures
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
not sure the new set is either but time will tell
the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling
maybe its just me but thats how they come across
i didnt have near as much string stretch with these either
ill keep using them just maybe in a different gauge
they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups
ukulele straps are a rare thing and ive yet to find the perfect one
not all uke players use straps some do and some dont
there is another device called a uke leash that also works well
it ties onto the headstock
the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument
i dont know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached
this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments
the wider clip spreads the stress out
i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it
but once on it is great
it gets easier the more you do it
id buy the neotech simple sling again
just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
later saw this one and decided to try it
very nice classical guitar strap
it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it
holds my cordoba in position perfectly
the device works as advertised
these do definitely have more output
i really dont know what else to say about them
its all about personal preference so
but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too
if you bought rocksmith 2014 and use an electric guitar get this
i had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up
after getting these the game picks them all up now
but i do feel confident in what i report here
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
a lot of harmonics and output captured
for that 5 stars easy
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
others may feel differently i am sure
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
so you are getting what they say
average to 3 i guess
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
i also really like the daddario pures
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
great feel to them and nice sounding
i use p90 single coils on my godin lg and these strings sound great
no problems with slipping and tuning
these strings are really nice
they have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark ernie ball feel
installed these on my schecter c1 hellraiser
the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good
but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings
they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised
if anything they feel worse than regular strings
last but not least  they are bad for frets
not great but not bad as well
the base strings feel really strange when sliding
the best eb slinkys ive ever used
on these i use the lights9s
even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well
i use them on all 4 of my guitars
two fender american standards gibson es335
gibson les paul with bigsby
i always have a set in each case
great tone sustain and flexibility
i get a much higher output  much better response and much better sound
great strings for just a little more
pulse there rocksmith endorsed lol
i bought this harmonica for our son
it seems to be manufactured well
as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built
but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica
i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks
couldnt pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price
our son says its easy to use and has a good sound quality
hey if it makes our son happy so be it
this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well
comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding
oo if you have a burkes outlet near you
im a beginner harmonica player and this was perfect for me
this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals
plays sounds feels and looks great
excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right
i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop
it has two brightness settings
illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same
i would look for something else if i didnt already have this
this little dude does a great job
i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine
its great for beginners or experts alike
sounds great right out of the box and plays well
all the notesreeds sounded good
ive had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite
this is the first harmonica i ever used
not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon
still seems to be good quality
of course hohner has been around longer than me
plastic comb with no recess
it sounds for the most part in tune and its tone is great
my kids love to hear me play it
however there is 1 con to this wonderful instrument
after owning it for several days the draw 2 hole went flat
i researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit
so i worked on my technique some more
maybe its my naivete in hoping for a perfect instrument
so i took one star away because of this problematic issue
otherwise i really like this harmonica
still suck at bending 3 4
a buddy of mine got one and hes killing it on the bends
we both been playing for about 3 months
will buy another if it ever wears out
i bought the special 20 pro packkeys ga  c
was using cheep pidmont blues harpstoys
i had to have more like an addiction
this harpbb has a beautiful tone
always loved the sound of the bb
made in germanyquality musical instrumentnot a toy
if you own special 20s then you already know how good they are
if you dont try one
you might end up with 6 like meor morein no time
beautiful sound and very well made
very happy with this product and the price is incredible
first real harmonica i have owned
read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many
the price is right and the quality seems good too
still trying to get the overblow
it has a good seal also
only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back
ive been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010
good news   these aquila strings are on most new ukuleles
bad news   these aquila strings are not standard on some others
you can get a tutorial to do anything on youtube
order extra to keep on hand
you cant go wrong with aquila
amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too
long lasting made with quality
got a new tenor uke and couldnt resist putting my fav strings on it
they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot
i got both hi and lo g sets
i put these on an epiphone les paul acousticelectric and it sounds so great
they are very smooth and warm and magical like a mythical unicorn
best strings for my ukulele
i only use aquila strings on my instruments
my ukulele has a better tone with these strings
strings make a big difference in any ukulele
these strings are the best
havent found any others that sound and feel so good
they lasted 3 years and i play nearly every day for hours
anyway i decided to change the strings because its been so long
happy that i did however
aquila strings will never let you down
highly recommended by all serious ukulele players
italian made need i say more
i admit it my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick
much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage
but with a little trial and error i figured it out
that said this thing is rock solid
easy to adjust and holds the ipad secure
no issues at all and would order again
i use this clamped to a table and its a superb product
then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages ibooks etc
best thing ive bought for my ipad in a while
it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily
ive owned it for a while now and havent had any problems with it
remember to have wifi in order to connect to panadora
quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well
cons its too heavy for my mic stands
i tried it on the boom arm and it made it topheavy and unstable
the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome
it comes with clips that can be used for other tablets
its bulky but it works well
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside
it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability
first time using item and it broke
the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke
i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music
all of my 734 tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits
i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet
not sure yet on the new line
they just dont feel as solid to me
that being said the pedal sounds great
the switch well we will have to wait and see
for 35 or so im not going to complain
soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level
thats not what it was designed to do
i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good
most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot
i do not own that pedal so i can not fairly make a comparison
the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble
the box is very good quality with nice large controls and metal foot switch
this is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players
reading the product description may give you an idea about this product
its solid well made and looksfeels like it can handle the world tour
true meaning of the us dream
wow yes that is it
no more to be written joy o the american dream
i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals
they all differ somewhati fell in love with this one the most
and when you are ready to wail just turn up your guitar volume
its a very noncolored sounding overdrive
its hard to call it any particualr sound
its just really good and clear and powerful
the price was right im happy with it
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product
it was to be shipped from japan
they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order
i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior
reputedly the joyo us dream is a copy of the suhr riot distortion pedal
after watching a side by side comparison on youtube i decided to buy one
but for 48 dollars im  happy with purchase
dirt box gold for under 50 bucks
sorry os2  its pawnshop time for you
a very boring dull uninspiring pedal
dont waste your time with this
this is i think based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal
its supposed to be very reactive to your playing
dig in and it puts out distortion play soft and it cleans up
this is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp
i can say its pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer
i found it really warmed up my sound in a good way
its expensive for a joyo but cheap for a really good od stomp
so far ive been super pleased by joyo pedals
i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together
definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised
this is my 6th joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint
like many have mentioned this pedal is like a ts but without the midhump
this pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture
this pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me
this is my favorite pedal
and i have a ton
lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal
sweet and warm when the drive is down
mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up
like a cranked tube amp
if you play the blues
i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal
it really does react to your playing style
i dont use distortion pedals
next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay
the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my fender deluxe reverb amp
i play mostly blues and classic rock
update  this pedal has since been returned
i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain
the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made
its not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives
the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well
i bought this based on video reviews on the net
i wish it had a bit more gain
over all though this is great for lightly distorted  edge of distorted sounds
as the description says this is a mild overdrive
it wont give you the brown sound
its not meant for metal
chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out
unlike many tube overdrive pedals this thing has tons of volume on tap
turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock
the focus knob is interesting  it doesnt act exactly like a tone knob
the lower settings are bluesy  the higher settings are bright and dynamic
but chances are both will sound good
but those are mostly minor gripes
its an excellent overdrive and an incredible value
i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tonesustain
quiet  much quieter than other compressors in this price range
fantastic pedal especially considering the price
this is lownoise compared to the mxr and simple to use
built well sounds good and does what youd expect
i still own most of these units except for this one
my setup is a very simple one
this thing simply didnt work right out of the box
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board
i ended up sending it back for a full refund
i dont in anyway blame the seller
just nothing with the name joyo on it
if youre only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware
you get what you pay for
no way this thing cost lest than 40
this compares to my other compression pedals i own
im super happy with my joyo pedals
the unit i received did not work
this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made
it just makes things sound solid
great price for a carbon copy pedal
just buy it you wont regret it
ive had this for almost a year
great pedal once you get it dialed in
everything i wanted and more
i love the joyo pedals
the primary effect of compression is to level or normalize the output across frequencies
particularly with a clean signal aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells
also certain notes sustain while others seem to die out too early
compression smooths over these problems and levels everything to a polished presentable sound
attack refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck
the joyo allows you to make this change easily
great pedal and amazing value
i have a lovehate relationship with compressors
for 4000 you cant go wrong with this one
i use it a lot on my practice rig
if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley 4 knob
i use a keeley in my live shows
as for this joyo i cant complain
it does its job pretty good but it does color your tone some what
i love for my practice rig
joyo continues to surprise me
the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool
however it doesnt even show up in the product picture on amazon
for the price this lil guy does the job
i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should
its a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass
i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed
as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though
its well made and sturdy with a metal body
when i tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent
i warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and yes
typical of quality control in the peoples republic of china
the normalmidcut switch is part of why its a great fuzz
dislikes   quality of chinese products is a crap shoot
there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal
i deduct 1 star because the loud feedback
this pedal sort of let me down a bit
i kept it because to be honest it is very cheap
why bother sending it back
i just cannot get any octave sounds idk am i missing something
i got this from a direct from china vendor
when it arrived the volume pot was not working
so i dont know if its a fair representation of these pedals
i have two other fuzzsswollen pickle  mxr 108 classic fuzz
to me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed
but do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon
this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal
you can google it for better instructions
still this aint bad for the pocket change they charge
for the price this is an amazing pedal
the sound from a 40 pedal is outstanding much better than i ever expected
this pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave
alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like hendrix
combined with joyos california hendrix is almost in the house
i have a marshall amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers
my guitar is a gibson les paul 2008 standard plus
from a construction standpoint these are remarkable for the price point
the whole thing has a good weight
the base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it
the box is a solid cast metal box with a very heavy metal base
the bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box
the pots look really good
for this pedal they went with press on knobs
if the knob ever breaks they are a very easy replacement at radio shack
the only weak point is the somewhat thin mid cut toggle switch
the pedal comes with a 9 volt battery
but darn it this is one amazingly nice pedal when i consider price
the gateshop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review
this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar
and screamythe fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes
this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after
for the price and product quality you cant go wrong with this one
and the functionality is great
this device sounds okay its usable
im not sure what i was expecting
its either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much
gives a really broken sound
there is no mid way on this pedal either
it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing
the octave is a joke
if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this aint it
i love this its do fun to play with
every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me
they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price
im sold out on joyo pedals
gets close enough to fake it for a club band
sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron
ive got several guitars and capos  this one is not too bad
i would still prefer classic style
seems like spring is a bit too strong
i bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case
i like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases
you get what you pay for in this case
this works fine on a standard guitar
i see other reviewers having issues
not sure if thats from rough handling
but for casual use this one is completely fine
looks better than the expansive one my grandson has
arrived early and is of great quality
fits my very old acoustic just right
i have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years
i have found no major issues with any of them
they come unfinished but well sanded
i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box
the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished
there is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start
materials and labor all look good to great
measuring for fit and specifications is on the money
frets look good and nut looks good
until i can install it i can only really vouch for 45 stars
unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the 5th star
even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the 5th star
so again another reason for the 5th star
the neck is  well made
the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most
it arrived on time and was as described
it is easy to use with one hand and does the job
not sure what else can be said about a capo
they either work or do not
the other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that
a three star at best
you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product
i like this a lot better than others that i have
easy on and off and stays put
the color advertised was not the one i received
this works well with the mandolin
it is certainly an easy change
i would recommend it or purchase again
a friend gives his time to help kids learn music
he mentioned the need for one so got it
the capo does what its does
these capo i know will lose their tension in time
i thought i had chosen a different capo
thats what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses
cant hold tightly on 1st string low c a little buzz
i wish i had more of a passion to play it but
its not bad if you want a uke but its pretty small
i dont know what i was expecting
if you wanna be that one fat hawaiian guy israel kamakawiwoole go for it
but i think he played a little bigger uke than this lmao
im a seasoned player of almost 10 years
ive been sad ever since
im in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play
i just got this uke today
now aesthetically this uke isnt as pleasing as say a martin sorpano
it sounds amazing for the price
nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too
this ukes sound is at least as good as a 50100 dollar uke
i see they make a mahogany version i think du200
i may get one in the future its only 4050 bucks on here amazing
i see some people complaining about the strings
and how it goes out of tune fast
when i got my martin soprano which wasnt cheap it did the same thing
its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists
would recommend this brand to anyone
this is a good budget uke
im not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
i got 2 of these for grandkids
i felt as if the uke was well worth the low price
probably would be improved with a set of aguilas
buy a clipon tuner too
it stays in tune and is fun to play
the best 29 that ive spent in a long time
after a week im already playing songs and im not a string player
dont purchase this without buying a tuner
i bought the snark sn6 uku tuner
the cradle guitar stand was for a friend
he was happy with the cradle guitar stand
hasnt had any problems with it
i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly
about the effects on finish
34  how do you know if you have this finish
basically the value of your guitar andor the age
it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars
update  received 6 of these
5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer
it was held by only one small tac weld
i got what i paid for
cheap price and cheap product
not worth the time   to send it back to amazon
one star only for this product
good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this
less than one star for this piece of
its only fault is its price
amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good
simply search  for guitar stands on here and see for yourself
i do not recommend this product
got it for 500 bucks and wish id bought about 5 more
buy if you need a stand
for the moneyyou wont be disappointed
but for this price why bother
under 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from 2050
plus this will look good on camera
awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer
this filter is awesome and for the price cant get any better
its a pop filter it works well and does the job
otherwise its a good option at a good price
it works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes
when not in use i keep it parked on the headstock
the shape and ergonomics are a mix between a kyser and a schubb s1
five stars all the way
the capos well made and doesnt show any manufacturing flaws at all
i like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around
nothings worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple
overall i think this capos a winner
its easy to put on and take off
theres no buzzing and it stays out of my way when im playing
this capo seems to handle quite nicely
i have been playing guitar for longer than i care to admit
so i am not a newbie to playing or working on guitars
todays modern guitars use medium jumbo frets
my 66 had thin frets
so i sent it back
so now it comes down to the shubb 1 deluxe and the planet waves
i went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times
i would perfectly tune the guitar with the snark and then apply the capo
i finally concluded that there was no difference
you could say that requires two hands in order to remove it
i got the same tuning results on all of them
tried as i might i could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of
so at least between these two i found no total differences
i love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings
to each his own they say
all in all they both are the best of all the ones ive tried
the pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too
i recommend this capo without reservation
i would highly recommend this to you guitar players
capos are not something that i shop for
i have had two for years
one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type
it is similar to this one
this one blows that one away
it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner
i play a tele and an acoustic martin
it works great on both
i play professionaly and this is the best thing ive gotten in two years
having played guitar for 45 years i have tried and used many many capos
it didnt work very well but it is what was available to me
many good capos have been made
this new ns triaction capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively
that said it works fine on a nonradiused ukulele
ive been using only kyser capos for many years now
i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths
i use neither of these so i have no comment on their usability
but for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered and is an excellent product
for years i have used a kyser capo because i like the trigger action
i havent used it much on my electrics
though  i like the kyser the planet waves triaction is super slick
it is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open
the trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser
i am now a believer
im switching to the planet triaction
it is definitely worth the few extra bucks
ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo
i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true
ive been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years
one of them is a capo
thats where this product comes in
it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob
too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch
not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes
either one is not good
this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner
overall this is a very good capo and i can recommend it without hesitation
if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing dont worry
what looks like a spring actually is a spring
the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that visegrips work
this one by far evolved from good design
the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly
the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings
the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension
this one even has a pick holder built in
it is light weight just the right size
i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar
the capo was easy to pop out of the package
the design is simple and easy to understand and use
it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar
the capo also has a handy builtin pick holder
over the years ive tried literally dozens of capos
its worked equally well on my acoustic  my electric
at this point i give it 2 thumbs up
i have used this on my les paul
it proved to be very functional
the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit
in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact
this one is harder to lose because of its size
i also appreciate the even tension across the strings
id recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there
the planet waves capo trumps mykyserin both speed and ease of use
the planet waves capo definitely gives the kyser a run for its money
not expecting much i adjusted the tension
zero buzz across the board
that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book
this capo also has a pick holder
i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos
i used this capo on a gibson j40 hummingbird and a j200
i played it finger style and strummed with a pick
however the sound left something to be desired
i do like the built in pick holder
to compare this i tried a g7 capo kaiser and schubb
frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb
it even comes with a handy pick holder
its a very well designed capo
i have several capos  this one really surprised me for the price
its lightweight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck
compared to my g7th which costs 3 times more it is a great buy
i really like planet waves products
they are made well  last
im a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves
what does this add to the others
well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo
id give it 4 stars
that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius
you cant miss with this product
i mean shouldnt it just immediately work
this capo works just fine
the only downside is the same as with most capos
it requires some finetuning to get it work on different guitars
the only one ive found that doesnt is the kyser
my go to capo for years
because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs
electric thin neck vs thick etc easily
so all said i still prefer my kyser
i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try
the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb
kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip
in comes the planet waves
between the 1st and 5th fret i dont really need adjust
you can do partial capos with this one
fortunately things have changed for the better
so why this particular capo
onehand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner
it is possible that this capo may become my favorite
i just really like the look feel and features of this smart design
looks like planet waves hit the mark once more
adjustment is easy and effective
the same company makes a tuning capo which i find handy at times
i dont often capo my guitar
you cant get better than this
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing
the idea is good and its cute
how many of these types of noise boxes do we need
or any combo little amp
its for bedroom use only
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot
when im in a apt
i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this
obviouslyin my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs
this little amp will sound great
the detailsthe amp itself is tiny
i have an electroharmonix pedal thats bigger than this amp
still it packs a punch
if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can
practice time just got better for your neighbors
the one lone tube in the micro terror is the preamp tube
mine came stock with a jj tubes 12ax7
but compared to a buddys roland and solid state ampeg its downright mellow
no effects loop means that your timebased effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy
speaking of power adapters  a previous reviewer is right
the external power brick for this guy seems fragile
im not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp
i found that out quickly
annoyance 2   this is a 20 watt amp right
if you dont run a 4ohm speaker you wont get all 20 watts
dont quote physics to me
at 8ohms i still get good volume
unlike a nice 20 pound amp the chord wont pull out
though it will gouge your floor
if you dont have one get one
the 300  350 are cheap and they work
ive gigged with it and it sings well
plus the added gag of tiny ukulele  tiny amp always draws a laugh
until i crank the dial over and shred some faces
and for the price this is a solid 4 star amp
i also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a celestion g12h30
or they begin their rave review with for a 150 amp
will be getting the amp in a day or two
at the sale price of 119 this cant be beat
volume at about8 oclock and gain at about 3 oclock
man what a great sound
typical british growl at higher gain settings
plenty loud for your bedroomofficewhatever
just be sure to use a good quality speaker cable like the gls
will be updating when i get the vintage 12ax7 tube replacement
so far i am very impressed
measured how loud this thing is
this is too loud for most apt
buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones
2nd updatetried out several compatible tubes
ie 12ay7 12at7 and the mullard 12ax7
i personally found the mullard to be the best
the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier
for quiet practice youre best getting a vox amplug imho
sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely
very happy with it considering the price point
great for the knock around uke though
it is a good fit for the soprano uke
a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week
not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place
it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear
there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case
this gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique
this is a very reasonable price for this bag
i got it for my les paul epiphone uke
this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke
ill just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesnt have one
this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice
luv the zip pocket in the front  perfect for strap snark capo whatever
this is a very sturdy and wellmade bag
much better for the money than i was expecting
i wish i could find a guitar bag that was this nice
my uke is very cozy inside
an ipad mini would probably fit
inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners
angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well
this is so darn cool
it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune
and it works on so many instruments
it has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele
the screen is also very bright and easy to read
it is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse
great little tuner very accurate and portable
nice bright screen perfect and the price is right
i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
s display to be more than sufficient
im currently using the snark on my guitar
you cant honestly ask for more
i love this little tuner
it is smaller than i thought it would be
it is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back
ive ordered 9 of these and only one has been defective
not worth shipping it back no big deal
great tuner for my guitar class
these are well made cables with 90degree connectors which is exactly what we needed
they work great with my pedals
im sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well
i can deal with it
no matter i wont be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again
much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws
everything is connected using this single length patch
love the color coding too
and what to do if one does fail
ill always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board
its a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff  love these patch cables
they all work and none of them have given any trouble
when i got the patches they were better quality than i expected
kind of a gross plastic smell
if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it
ive tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer
it is great for a quick way to get electrified
to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
this is a great little addition to both my violin and my mandolin
while some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele
if it is the pickup will mute the a string and its annoying
the pickup adds a bright clear sound to your instrument without feedback or hassle
for being so cheap this pickup works surprisingly great
i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin
it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it
i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin
a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try
it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem
it sounded like i was in a great concert hall
whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it
god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified
for an 8 item you cant go wrong
it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone
i originally rated this pickup 5 stars
basically the cherub is just too sensitive
it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup
you can talk into your instrument
it sounds really natural and its easy to dial in a nice sound
not a slam on the productthats just the nature of the beast
its a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful
unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin
all in all 7 very well spent
thank goodness pickup prices are coming down
now if only the price of pickupchics would come down
i have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years
i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound
primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer
i hit the tone button and all that is done for me
it makes a dynamic mic sound great
it makes working with a condenser mic easier
most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb
they either use too much or too little
i recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb
each one sat just right
when you solo the vocals you can tell which is used
in the mix it was more subtle
i have to admit my own vocals arent perfect
thats because youre hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones
this takes a second to get use to
im not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing
guitar is my primary instrument and i am a decent singer but not great
hvr considering the price i think its excellent
would buy it again if stolen as they say
well those reviewers were right  the pitch correction function has no effect
also i couldnt see any effect between engagingdisengaging the tone button
the effects are beautifully done
wet means more of the effect and dry means less
the xlr out goes straight to your mixer
the unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature which i leave on
i suspect that most folks will want less of this than more
its also perfect for adding vocal effects to small barebones pa systems
it transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true pa
youd be dumb not to get one while theyre cheap
depends on what your looking for
nope but it has some tricks up its leave for the price
i have owned almost every octaveharmonizerpitch shifter on the market
for what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of you cant beat it
you wont find that in anything else under 300
instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design
otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam
great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff
as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful
all the pitch shift settings sound like theyre 30 cents sharp
this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect
ive read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also
one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals
making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable
the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it
works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help
this tuner blows away my old guitar professorqwik tune tuner
this tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion
the beat boy is everything that this unit is and then some
i started to play the violin a few months ago
the korg ca1 also cost slight less
however now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome
she has the korg tm40 metronome
i opted to purchase the newer model korg tm50pw instrument tuner and metronome
i play using this device
it is portable so i always have it with me
i tune the a to 432 and this works well for that
has a tuner and a metronome
it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings
this is a good thing  its sensitive
so ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now
one channel 8 does 9v with 500ma sounds great right
i plug in my even tide timefactor and works great by itself
once i added other pedals there became a horrible hum
like noticable and just horrible
this isnt the best power supply available
it doesnt truly isolate each input
so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not
its not always just the power supply making the noise
it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors
a power conditioner will sometimes help as well
there is some noise but i dont attribute that just to the power supply
it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down
it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others
here is a comparison of the jp02 chameleon and the onespot
unlike other cheap chinesemade ripoffs ahem
behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny
i have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it
not a bad price either
so far this power supply is great
well its a solid chunk of metal
you can power any lightweight 9v 12 or 18v stompbox with this
would have been nice to have a few really long ones
joyo makes great quality products  cheap
i love this product it works great
ive read its not really complete isolated but it does the job
i didnt realise how much noise my one spot was adding
i ab them both one after the other and it truly was quieter
everything else in the other 9volt 100ma slots
its a lot quieter now
i recommend trying it and saving some cash
i admit i havent had it long but so far so good
i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply
unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable
the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out
the jp02 frees me up from any other wall warts
this is the only reason i gave them four stars
if you get these and they arent perfect
send them back until you get a perfect set
not much else to say
not much you can say about these theyre knobs
they fit perfectly and are of high quality finish
not much to say here  theyre knobs
they look great and were cheap
bought them to replace the old 34vintage34 style knobs on my lp clone
i have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work
focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this
i feel like i might accidently break it off if im not too careful
the onboard monitor volume and headphone is fantastic
the last thing i want to mention is the xlr preamp
i have to say it is spectacular
there is absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks of any kind
it definitely stands up to their reputation
the demos on their website show how simple it is to use
despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc
its a great intro model not just for ipads
whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord
its an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
im a teacher not a student
i have only used it with garage band but it works really well
the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short
i bought 2 of the same ziotek extension cableat the recommendation of focusrite
one worked the other didnt
so yeah best of luck with that
focusrite should really have made a longer cable
other than that i like it a lot
if it works correctly ill update this review after doing a few recordings
so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me
this music package by led zepplin is historical and put together well
great for any zep fan
i especially liked the unreleased version of for your life
what else can be said that isnt implied in the title of this review
bluray surround with the band was just amazing
but had no idea if this would be as good as all that
never fear you need to see this film
the guys prove that the hype was legit
they took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event
i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day
the bands on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job
a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this
the flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal
i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under 200 new
a steal in my opinion
having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set
having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly
first of all its huge
but finally you get over that but seriously its huge
the midi clock sync implementation is flawed
to have a midi in and not be able to midi syncquantize the looper
consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision
you have to be committed to dealy
youll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches
i cant comment on the looper as i never used it
tap function also helps a lot
all type of delays are sounds beatiful
dont believe this is what it is meant for
a simple delay looper will suffice
this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
if so have a few of these on hand and replace that nut
you will hear the difference and they dont wear out like plastic
just make certain you get the height correct so your action isnt too high
you can always remove more material but you cant put it back on
this is a quick easy improvement
i have bone on all of my guitars
i liked the string spacing on these nuts
this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners
some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges
the base of this bone nut does not have a radius
this is more common in vintage guitars though
my guitars sustain was definitely improved with this nut
with a little sanding this fit my fender american strat perfectly
great sound that only a bone nut can produce
my strings stay in tune even better with this installed
also the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated
my piece arrived in a week thank you very much
this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction
two pieces easy to set up in seconds
far better than any light weight chrome stand this has guts
easily adjustible knobs tighten easily and firmly
good height adjustment for sitting or standing
this is a really nice music stand
i wasnt expecting it to be such high quality
definitely got what i wanted
the orange gearlux logo looks pretty cool too
the resttray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments
bottom line  this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price
what more can i say its a sheet stand
this is a great stand and highly adjustable
can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall
there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rocksolid
but this is a great stand
for the money this is a great guitar case
i bought it for a silvertone sd10 which costs about 120
the guitar fits it fine
i dont think i would take it on an airline
they destroy luggage so i dont think it would fair well
mine opens and closes ok and the lock works
it is well worth the 60 i paid for it
looked at a lot of cases most priced 90 or above
solid well padded sturdy latches and everything lines up
very happy with my purchase
this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment
it was way too short for my seagull s12 coastline
this is a sturdy case that looks good too
they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha
did not end up using them but will one day
great product for the price
many people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone
this guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was
wow it really did make a huge difference
this guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money
but with the string and bone upgrades i cant imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic
it changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar
i am so happy with my changes
the high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep
the sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next
i am so pleased and excited with my guitar
if you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle
change them its a very quick fix
and find a nice set of strings
these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment
the sn13 is another great snark chromatic tuner with a super tight display
no matter for me since all i use is the tuner anyway
cheap easy durable these things are worth the small price
i have one for each guitar and just leave them on
i love the snark tuners and i own several different models
they all work great and of the various models i prefer the sn2 red
its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark
with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised
and it looks great too
ill be honest here  i bought this one primarily because of its looks
not a lot of white clipon tuners around
still its a typical snark
my only real gripe isnt unique to this model but to all snarks
no reason to be out of tune with these tuners
there are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators metronomes etc
but this device is simple portable easy to use and just plain works
but all i bought it for was the purpose of tuning mission accomplished
the big question is 34why
34 especially since its designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously
and its always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions
this will help you figure things out
and if youre not careful it may find a permanent home
with this pedal its easy
are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals
but they do the job just fine
that way i can shuffle through the presets with one stomp
some have two pedal effects some have 6
best 100 ive spent on gear
this is an extremely versatile pedal
there are tons of effects
some i might not use but there are plenty i will use
new firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects
you download the firmware and install via the usb port
i use it with a vht special 6
i have a fulltone ocd after the zoom
the effects sound excellent to me
im now a zoom fan
if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is
but this means trial and error and a busy wallet
the solution may be this zoom ms50g
i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms50g
im an true analog guy
but when i grabbed this pedal i was blown away
this little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size
a lot of which do not sound to digital
i was amazed at the tones i could pull out of it
for 99 it is a steal
i would pay twice that for what this pedal does
easy to navigate and understand
small enough to fit on any pedalboard
easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches
can easily set it up for live situations
but i set mine up for a few effects i use live
when in the studio this is where the pedal shines
also it cant be beat for when youre just jamming alone at home
i was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so
went to a local music store heard and was sold
no one can touch amazons price and service
get off the fence and buy this pedal
i promise you wont be sorry mcons  no power supply or usb cable
besides that the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months
meanwhile im going to buy another sturdier gig bag
save your money and get something better than this
but in no way matters
just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel
what can you expect for 20 tho
for my first gig bag its ok
the chromacast also has many more pockets
someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender
if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case
at 2000 this bag is a steal
this fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection
i own two of these
the first did not have a compartment door
so things just roll around inside case
but this one is just fine
no i would not take it on tour
but as far as run around and taking lessons
its safe all latches match up well
manufacturers website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar
i have an esp eclipse
they need to fix the info on their web page
im not a fan of shaped les paul cases
the quality of it is above my expectations
the only thing i wouldve like different is the accessory box inside
they couldve make it a little bigger
the box already fell down 4 times i got small kids
and nothing happened to it or the guitar
great product worth every penny
it is more than i hoped for
very nice protection for my luna
it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat
once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery
have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon
all latch well and look good
this product meets all my expectations
my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case
it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment
the corners of the case are well reinforced
overall it is a bargain for the price
as for size its designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars
will do the job of good protection
this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted
the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched
the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig
it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too
strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around
fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice
this does the job but its fairly thin and not all that well padded
the strap that came with it is no great shakes either
fits nice and provides good protection
great gig bag for acoustic guitar
very well made with good padding
it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps
it fits the guitar nicely
the strap and picks were an added bonus
i dont plan on keeping it long
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it
spend a few more dollars it is worth it
im a beginner so im not very picky on the accessories yet
but this was a great package deal for this price
shipping was free it arrived in under 1 week from ordering
not as much padding as i would like
my old bag had more
other than that i like the pockets and overall design
i have had and tried about every compressor out there
lastly the old standard dyna comp
this is a very transparent compressor
i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric
low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11 00
it gives wonderful string balance and sustain
at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds
and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone
none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string
as close to a rack mount as it gets
the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues
from here you can get any type of compression you want or need
mine has a white case
it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it
both knobs at 12 oclock toggle in middle didnt change the internal switches
this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality
if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal
driven full distortion it adds sustain
now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic
look it up on youtube
this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack
it never sounds 34thumpy34 or unnatural  but always musical
it stacks well with the ep booster and another compboost in the chain too
its sturdy and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position
wish i would have known about it sooner
very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue
this arm hold the weight of a atr2100 microphone fine
it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect
not too big and gets the job done
i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap
no directions inside or on the box
i messed with it for about 5 minutes
i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic
i read the description but it did not say cheap
oh well i went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead
will not hold a blue yeti  yeti pro microphone
designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job
i have to say i really couldnt feel the difference
25 whereas the same string in the exl111 set is
i guess as long as both are still available exl111 being phased out
i will be selecting solely on price
at first i wasnt sure what to expect from these daddario balanced tension strings
i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family
he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product
the daddario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price
they are inexpensive and sound great
the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money
it seems like yes they are
the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better
there isnt a huge difference
the exl110bt strings are about 500 a set
my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot
ill stick with what i know well
my 1981 lucille did love these strings
they worked out just fine
on the packaging i dont like what daddario has done
all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes
they loop two strings together and i hate that
they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing
but seriously that little paper wouldnt kill anybody
i also dont care for the color coded rings on the strings
lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors
it is a small thing but i dont like it
i prefer that the rings all be brass one color
yeah im the only one that sees that problem
they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend
i am impressed with daddarios electric strings
easy to adjust to very light on my fingers and theyre built to last
036 respectively which i can feel as well as a slightly thicker b string
013 which frankly i cant feel
the xls are comparable in gauge to ernie ball regular slinky yellow
do i fully understand how this works
nope but they sure do sound good
their sound is bright just like their xl cousins
all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist
but on my acoustics its been daddario j16s since day one and still is
never had one bad set out of over a hundred
i adore the sound and the reliability
so why have i never tried their egit strings
because the slinkys are perfect
but i must say  so are these
one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are
a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact
i know thats bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming
it was nice to get these through vine and try them out
it sounds cleaner and brighter
i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive
ive been playing daddario xls in their standard
looking at the tension table daddario publishes its clear why this is the case
after playing a while the set started to feel more natural to me
010s in stock as well as over a dozen
i could immediatly tell the difference in both feel  sound
reasonable price great sound  long lasting
to me thats a perfect combo
i put these on a parker
great that they have uniform tension
took a bit to get used to but they are very playable
strung these up on my lp goldtop with p90s
for one thing theyre pretty stiff
they bend but not easily
maybe thats what they mean by balanced tension
theyre also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s
who would these appeal to
daddario strings are like the kias of the string world
ive always been partial to nickel wound particularly semiflatwound but i digress
my typical strings are elixirs so im used to them lasting a long time
in this case the strings sound good
like most nickel strings do
so like most daddario strings
theyre not bad but dont expect them to last like elixirs do
you get what you pay for
i have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years
i just keep coming back to these
i just cant think of a single complaint
the daddario exl110bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great
the strings had a good feel to them as well
where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords
you check the tuning and its tuned alright but why isnt it sounding right
these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords
bar chords were terrific too
i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
this is the most awesome loop pedal ever
does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop
super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered
when done simply tap again and the led goes to green and plays back
i dont know the limit of overdubs but i havent reached it
the tone preservation is excellent and havent noticed any issues there
it worked great then one night again i couldnt hear myself recording
out of the 4 i have it only liked 2
when i used that adapter it seemed to work just fine
its only got a basic feature set but thats all i need
this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop
ive used the boss rc20 and the digitech stereo jam man
although the others have more features i like this little pedal
so many things i have developed
great tool and good quality product
pros  works really well and is easy to use
the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too
they should have put it higher up right next to the dial
overall impression  the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives
its a great and inexpensive looper
it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well
if it doesnt take batteries thats fine but give me an adapter
this thing was over a hundred dollars
dont force me to buy an accessory just to power it up
i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it
this is a wonderful little looper
if you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbing
the tc electronics ditto pedal will not disappoint
and you cant beat the price
wow for the size this is amazing
plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper
would definitely purchase it again
tc just does things right
i do a single duo and full band
perhaps i didnt take the time
i did this for two days in a row
its simple built well and and fun to use
it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
what a great little gizmo
i had a boss rc3 looperit involved too much bending over for me
and too hard to figure out
the ditto is so easy
i take my trusty fender esquire
plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal
then connect output of the ditto to the amp
set echo for multiple head repeats
play the slow 4 chords to maggot brain
count each chord as 123  456
to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat
you turn on the echo pedal
and proceed to jam on maggot brain
definitely the best looper ive come across
lots of looping time simple to use unlimited overdubs
really cant go wrong with the ditto
perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyones pedal board
having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting
the ditto is great for practice though
this looper is serious worth every cent i spent on it
ive owned loop stations dm4s jam mans samplers and all that jazz
theyre all full of crap you dont need
this pedal has flawless colorless sound quality
it records what you sound like
you click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop
tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over
you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers
smallest cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find
this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics
same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it
i will not buy anther one
i will not recommend to other musicians
then i found this for about 100 and i immediately sprung for it
this is a great practice tool
all it does is make loops
students would be especially encouraged to get one of these
this is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes
the playback sound is very good quality
i had previously owned it digitech jam man i also try the boss
the unit is extremely small but dont let that fool you
lets be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes
im a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever
am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43
that being said using the looper was an eye opener
the thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression i played
theres no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing
so it is an amazing critic for us beginners
this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun
beware that there is a learning curve to looping
with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while
i use this mainly with a double neck bassguitar
tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years
their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception
you cant go wrong with these were ordering 8 more pairs
and the tascam th02 keeps up
im really surprised at how well they perform
lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp
for fit  i have a large noggin like size 7 58 hat
and these headphones fit well
not too tight snug but not confining
the padding is good and soft
these headphones get the job done
i like the build and design
very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs
these headphones are 100 amazing
i could not believe the sound quality
nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price
no i do not work for tascam
but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction
it is not the best but the sound is superior
i only just received these but thought id give my first impression
the 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone
im not especially particular but do like good sound
theres some good bass classical music was clear
i wasnt totally blown away either
they are comfortable but not as comfortable as id like
they do get warmer than id like
i definitely feel relieved to have them off
i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour
who knows maybe theyll wear in and improve
ill update this review if i have more to report
they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product
some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons
whats funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge
its comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches
but the pushing against your head is the tight part
also i compared them to the sennheiser hd201
still a relatively short amount of time
however i think my rating will remain at 3 stars
its not unbearable but if you can find an alternative its probably best
that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit
i cant speak for someone with a bit smaller of a headand ears
great sounding sturdy enough build etc
the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less staticlike etc
besides the volume these differences werent huge
i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them
but i dont think youre getting 5x the sound quality
all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable
i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help
so its kind of like double trouble
however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity
as of now i hardly use them at all
but im glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test
if so youve got a bargain on some great cans
although im not onstage bouncing aroung
they hold the strap on just fine
no changing hardware like strap locks
more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice
but i will order more
so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks
time to open another carlsberg cheers fender
my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird
i would buy these again
this is a good product
these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on
its a good amp im happy with it
but i mostly play punkhardcore and blues which is does very well
oops there goes a star for the con job
peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less
ill wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
i replaced a 35 year old fender chorus with this
i have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud
this is an awesome amp
its fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new
i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player
very very loud electric guitar amp
i cant raise the volume above 1 in my house
beautiful sound for each of the different modes
the amp simulation is top notch
awesome value for the price
i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom
i still cant get over the fact that it is a 40w amp
the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage
i have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless
the dp008ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp03 digital portastudio
speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first
the bottom line for me is  it does and it doesnt
however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip
tascam should consider a similar accessory
i think tascam would be wellserved taking that into account
the tascam dp008ex is great
i love this little box
here are a few of the features that i really like about it
its portable and runs on 4aa batteries
it has compression exciter  deesser as well as eq and reverb
it has a mastering section with effects
you can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks
it feels sturdy not that i would drop it
just to name a few
i compared this against the fostex mr8mkii which i also own and like
as another reviewer put it this wont replace your daw
the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too
the portability factor is huge in my opinion
plus its fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas
and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section
the good  8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time
no guitar effects or drum patterns like bosss br micro 4 and 80
its also more than just a dp008 with more tracks
most of my recording lately has been done with various apple platforms
first off if you are planning on buying the us322 dont
buy its bigger brother the us366
i have been running it with pro tools 9 since 2011
sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved
i dont blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake
it works in win 7 just fine
they provide you with an activation code after you register
they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version 65
so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd
included with the interface is a 5 foot usb printer style cable
you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer
windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver
so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update
it took at least 15 minutes to do that update
i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash
i tried it and the light wouldnt even come on indicating usb
when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked
the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb 11
the us322 comes with a printed quick start guide
this tascam interface works great with pro tools
they are clearing the shelves preparing for 11 but it has bugs
pt 9 is all i need
2 installed driver on my old g4 mac running 105
8 opened garageband got  no input message
could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os 106
if i get a new computer i will update my review
i love tascam gear and have used it for nearly 30 years
i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do
im sorry but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive
there should be a complete manual at least in pdf included with the product
which brings me to another minor complaint  no linux drivers included
then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware
yeah i know touch screens are cool
i am old school and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful
good mixers especially for multitrack recording can be complex and difficult to learn
come on tascam you can do better than this
perfect for my beginner studio setup
all set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe
one issue is that this is not a plugandplay device
i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay
the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well
it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose
i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound
purchased this and a comparable hosa cable
this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved
hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling
i will stick to gls products from this point forward
i ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised
they are excellent quality clear tone and a great look
for price and quality these are top notch
definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that ive come across
plus the tweed look really grows on you
ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home
holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on
first of all 20 ft is not too long
better to have a little bit of extra length than too short
the cable works fine and is very flexible
also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones
constructed well works perfectly rolls up nicely with no kinks
the  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by gls audio
these are durable but i get some noise from the cables
its barely audible but its distracting nonetheless
it gets in the way and is hard to stay stretched out
it also seem tightly put together at the ends
like it even if its a bit long for use at home
lol the cord delivers good sound quality
ive removed 1 star because of the 14 casing
the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily
i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up
ive been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great
the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest
this however is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot
leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap
i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button
the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it
now i have more confidence with this strap
its not gucci but doesnt feel like plastic either
theyre the cheesiest looking leather ive ever seen
it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar
works well with the axl pg515
this is good quality for the price
snap is large and holds well but is easy enough to unsnap when needed
i have a vintage 60s dixon hummingbird
i was really worried about scuffing it up
i wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar
now it is easier to handle when trying to play
this strap button works great
works so much better than the string around the neck thing
it comes with light medium and heavy picks
even the light picks are thicker than the 34thin34 picks i had ordered before
i like having the variety though
this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness
every color and size youll ever need
this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality
i would buy this again or recommend to anyone
definitely a 5 star purchase
love my assortment of picks and the price was right
the retailer gave me some mediums
i find i do better with heavy thickness
i have a heavy touch when i play the guitar
with the different thicknesses i can choose which works best for me
from experience it never hurts to have extra picks around
since i bought these i have been using the heavy thickness ones
they really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar
a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses
an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
i have about quit using picks now
but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses
thats what you get with this
from very thin and flexible to 08 and hard you get a selection
perfect to try different sizes and shapes
and high praise for godps music
the dura picks have more variety theres only one in each thickness
the celluloid ones come two per size
a fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from
a great deal for a nominal amount of money
a good variety of different picks
i got it for me and my dad
great price for 12 picks spanning from light  heavy
picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks
after taking my guitar lessons
just go for the gusto and find what you like
if you are picky these are all eye candy
nice flexible easy to hold and i received on time at a great price
throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials
microphones cables straps tuner etc
folds up easy fits great
solid and super easy to use
you have just simply got to try this little guitar stand
it folds up so small and yet remains very stable in use
anything can be knocked over but this really works better than you might believe
i just move it around the house wherever i feel like playing
fold it up to take with me when i go out of town
everyone who sees it loves it
it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it
i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand
it is very lightweight which is also a plus
i use the stand at home too
i have recommended this stand to others also
features i like  lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily
those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work
i mean really work well too
not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you
this stand is small compact and sturdy
this stand holds up my ukulele so yay
this is a modeling amp
it has several presets to emulate different sounds
but for a small room its great
common complaint i have seen   no clean channelpreset
this is not the case
that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp
another doesnt and is very clean even on the factory preset clean
i very nearly got a different amp
i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii
for 100 usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for
itll keep me busy for a long time
i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar
34youre not getting the right tone man
i would not have been able to do that without this amp
excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii
my son has also joined in the fun
it can be a little daunting for a newbie
i couldnt get it to sound like i wanted it to
i was so wrong in giving it only 2 stars
i must now rerate it with a 5 star
this amp does almost too much for the money
it can do anything and sound any way you want it too
wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this
it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have
so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early
buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it
if you are looking for a small plug and play amp
but it youre looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities
it is growing on me and i wouldnt part with it now
luv it i had version 1 and this amp isnt much different
but for practicing in your bedroom or similar its perfect
plenty of sound effects to mess around with
are they as good as dedicated 100 per stomp box effects
probably not but so what
just found out the best part of this amp
sounds much better than listening to the pcs normal puny speakers
got the marshall dsl 40 watt combo
works very well and is portable
not literally a right angle but a very good angle
why do you have to be so difficult
this is simply the ideal
what a great aframe stand especially for the money
i like it so much that i ordered three more
the similarlypriced fender is a fpos
it leans wayyy too far back
i couldnt have hoped for more from these stands
it has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance
yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space
this stand is sturdy and my guitars 34seat34 like an anchor
i use one for my electric and another for acoustic
will be getting another as soon as i get daughters new guitar
this guitar stand is as basic as you can get
has padding where it needs it to protect guitar
provides good stability and displays guitar nicely
perfect stand as long as you dont have othersroomateskidspetsetc
who may bump it and knock it over
the best way to describe this stand
works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely
acoustic and electric but not at the same time
i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand
i use it at practice and during our live shows
you cant go wrong with this
i like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily
i bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection
nothing more to say but it said i needed 1 more word
i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons
this worked well for that
also  for my baritone ukulele
sturdy provides good support and looks good
i am pleased with my purchase
and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo
the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
just barely gets the job done
i have a fender jazz bass standard
this thing folds up so it is easy for storing
it is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard
not the best but not the worse
this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar
only downside is theres no neck support
simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively
low to the ground so balance is not an issue
needs little space another plus
i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago
ive purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work
stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials
its a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection
if oxidationwear is an issue switchcraft makes goldplated jacks
just what i was looking for
what really can you say about switchcraft they just make good solid parts
grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack
bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am redoing
ive learned the hard way that there are some things you dont skimp on
not a lot to say about it really
its metal and it works
switchcraft is usually a good product
this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner
ive been using this for a month or so and it works as described
some people rate this above the snark devices but i cannot
i have a few tuners that are somewhat like this gt1 clipon tuner
the size of the clipon gt1 one is also great
so far the tuner is very accurate
however i could have got this product for a lot cheaper
tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially
little harder to read than i would have liked especially in sunlight
it would be nice if there was a sound feature
one other thing that i had in mind so ill say it here
thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon
great little piece of leather
does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar
they are a great idea
i have two of these and i use them
id definitely recommend them to anyone who doesnt like tying on their guitar straps
actually i bought two of them
it is a 5star product
this is a great item
i received this yesterday in my order
not sure what to do now
this is an attractive leather head stock strap
the leather is very soft and flexible
i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather
i have used the kyser spelling
i use it on my taylor 910ce taylor 718e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
first lets get the easy stuff done with
no sharp points to damage the guitar
and this thing is easy to use squeeze put on neck done
i tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both
when playing the strings behave as normal
no odd muting or dropouts
the capo is solid on the neck
with this new capo i am happy to use it
easy to use efficient sturdy looks nice and sounds great
good spring action made pretty solid
no buzzing on the strings when i put it on
fit perfect to my taylor t5 and no cons i can find so far
i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program
im not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices
any brand that works well at the right price ill buy it
the fit of the headphones is big for me
usually they are too small
i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit
the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent
the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6
the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much
these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass
theyre also not for those with smaller heads
these headphones are almost perfect
the sound is great good balance between highs and lows
they are comfortable too as far as ear pads go
the only problem is the size
maybe all the people at tascam have really big heads
so minus one star for that
otherwise sound quality is excellent
comes with a 14 inch adapter which is nice
jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow
stravinsky violin concerto  anne sophie mutter from mutter modern
the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity
i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head
excellent bass response not muddy at all tight mids and clear highs
to boot they are extremely comfortable as well
the foam fits nicely around your ears conforming to the contours of your face
some people may not like that
kudos to tascam for making such good headphones
this just doesnt work for me in the studio
i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on
best quality than polytune  1 lighter and best switch
mine was still brand new to me and worked really well
this polytune 2 is amazing  bright accurate strobe option well built
its just another example of tc hitting it out of the park yet again
i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner
the pitch black is nice and bold and bright
so its a give and take issue
this pedal is great help on stage
the pedal is very good at this
dont let that keep you from checking this hot rod out
love the sound it produces
well made like a tank
expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time
tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just ok to me
the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static
i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb
this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal
for the money i am not mad i tried it
when i plugged into the hot tubes i was surprised but immediately intrigued
what the hot tubes does is anything but 34familiar34 from an affordable od pedal
in fact it likely even adds bass to your sound
there is a tone circuit bypass switch that i do not fully understand
however the hot tubes completely transforms that tone
there are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about
first i want to make clear that this is a dark bassy pedal
it certainly wont be for everybody but so far i like what i hear
this is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest
only with your guitar volume knob
the point is this pedals so great and has a great range of dirt
also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range
its literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps
i can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper
ps  look at the price
do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal
just get it try it and see if you like it jeez
this thing is incredibly cool
your loop can be as long as 10 minutes with unlimited overdubbing
it was worth the wait
you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music
its a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing
operation is simple press once to record
press again and it begins playback
press a third time to dub on top of your last layer
if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub
tap twice to stop play of the loop
press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing
switch is a soft switch so there is no click
it is very responsive to pressure
there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop
i was lucky enough to get my hands on one early
that said the digitech express xt is a little better
i also have the very first jamman with the add on 3 button footswitch
i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this
dont expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though
slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable
this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer
i had that one first and it is horrible to use
it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those
find a youtube video to see all of its potential
best looper for the money
you can jam for hours with this thing its awesome
the factory battery lasted about 1 hour
the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes
this makes the unit useless
exposing the delicate printed circuit board
the potential for damage here is very high
its going back to the store where i purchased it
they even work on cymbals if youre looking for a quicker decay
you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed
ive been using them for years and they work amazingly
i really wanted to like these but theyre a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin mess
however chilling them did work well enough
that aside these will greatly improve the way any set sounds
oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills
i also bought a lesson book for drums for myself
so whats not to like
i liked it so much i bought a second
i love these clipon tuners
added november 8 i put the star back
ive got another one on one of my banjos
its like any other snark super tight tuner
maybe its just a matter of finding the right place to put it
ill report back if it doesnt happen again for a while
i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display
im quite disappointed and it sits here with no use
still to me it was money out the window
ive purchased many snark tuners
for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use
very stable and they make tuning a joy
this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read
my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use
i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it
they need to rethink the design
but overall i like it
ill still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well
overall this is a definite buy
this is the only tuner you need
has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use
this capo comes with a pick holder
if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo
this bracket holds the ns micro tuner of which i have 3
i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications
a simple modification but bordering on genius
i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit
okay i bought a 1966 telecaster brand new back then
still have it and love it
i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and 4 acoustics
on my electrics i love extra light 8 gauge strings
anyhow i digress but for a reason
05034 found on gibons and espltds
to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked
okay so here is how i put it to the test
okay back to the explanation
the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy
you dont even need to hear it
it wasnt even a little bit sharp
to be super critical here is another tip
for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so
i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets
with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that
this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp
of course if it can accurately handle 8s it will breeze through anything thicker
teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks
so it will work the same with both
i might get another one for a backup
i completely agree with 34jpfromoh34
i dont understand the clip for a tuner on this thing
i have several clipon tuners that clip directly to the headstock
and most are planet waves already
i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition
and the pick holder is a nice touch but
i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me
as others have noted there are other better capos out there
if youre looking to buy a capo id recommend this over a kyser
its awkward to apply and remove quickly
otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb
the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference
i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension
several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck
there was some slight noticeable differences
granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist
the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards
i find my left hand hitting the lever when im in open position
i just think it could have been better designed
ill stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser
this is one of the nicer capos ive used
certainly superior to the old school bandbased jobs from yesteryear
also it clamps without bending the strings
ive used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints
i own dunlop kyser and g7th nashville capos
i dont like the direction the dunlop faces it seems awkward
i like the g7th nashville capo but the spring tension is inconsistent
only downside is i think the nashville capo looks better
might be some sort of powdercoating as well
always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm
this is an exemplary capo
its made of serious aluminum and the spring is supersolid
its an easy oninseconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets
it sits well on any sixstring though is not flat enough for a classical
60 picks perfectly by the way
if you havent ever experimented with capos try them out
i tested this capo on several guitars and with one exception it worked well
steelstring dreadnought archtop jazz box and les paul worked nicely
not so much on a flat fretboard classical
the capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck
thats probably a rare problem for the intended user
all in all its a nice little capo
goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks
this is the best capo we have out of three
we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one
easy to put on the guitar
the micro adjuster is easy to adjust
it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring
this is the capo to get
the capo is pretty good
i like the ability to customize tension
overall this is good but not great
as i strummed each string to sound was so clear
i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever
and the price aint so bad either
notice in the name guitar input
headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems
they also depend on the built in adda converters in the ipadios device
so here it the continuum
amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc
it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing
it also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic
yeah go look that up
anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices
and then  yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy
just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go
this also helps those of us using electric guitars that dont have extrawound humbuckers
a small device that doesnt color input sound and doesnt get in the way
the apogee jam works great and it sounds great
i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band
if there is any latency i cant hear it
apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception
likewise it worked well with my 4string bass as well
i was able to record a whole song in no time
for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable
46 starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality
and little it is not much bigger than the jack
if bon scott only knew
which is yet another step forward in highquality home recordings
probably insist on  34dont mention anybody but us
they must stay in our universe
take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music
this will work with my daughters ipod touch generation 4
i was surprised at how small the jam is
slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter
overall pretty good and very simple to operate
just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice
i didnt have any problems with either of the three supplied cables
its simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality
youll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions
with the ipad this isnt as noticeable
even with that issue i think the jam is a good value
these may be my new favorite bass strings
they seem bright yet still soft
the lows sound present and clear
to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings
these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with
i feel like i should be paying more for these strings
this is a roundwound string with a hexshaped core
this is the perfect fit for all my basses
i have two ibanez and two essex basses
they recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge
i play fingerstyle and they feel great
they are made in  the usa and they use recycled packaging
these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound
give these a try if youre looking for some new strings
i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers
gave them a good stretch and theyre holding pitch well
that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting
ive been using d addario strings for 20 years to great satisfaction
these flex steels are excellent
bass tones response and resonance are superior to my ear
you cant go wrong with these guys
you dont know how good youve got it
because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice
but if youre popping and slapping these come through loud and clear
i bet marcus would kill with them
i think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles
i can say that the brands8217 reputation carries over to bass8212these are phenomenal strings
ive been using daddario xl nickel wounds on my pbass for a long time
100 e they have a
i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics
after stringing them up  tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded
they sounded great all up  down the fret board
where i really noticed the difference was in recording
i have to admit this up front  im a terrible bass player
i do dabble with the bass but im not proficient with it
these strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time
they have 34punch34 and 34snap34 which are good things to have in a bass
when i need another set ill buy these
these are some bright strings
good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets
as rotosounds and theyre only a jackson not a bad string
minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some bright strong mids
they do seem to stay in tune well
havent had to change tuning once they settled in
my daughter is learning how to play and the
48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain
the wound strings also seem quite stable
put these on my gl s500 electric
sound great play great keeping their tune
none broken yet but i dont usually break strings
i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs
blues blues slide rock metal
i use daddario strings a lot
i try others but always come back to them
these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on
i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string
they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference
the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch
these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use
after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference
having these nyxls on there is just one more added benefit
i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up
plus they feel and sound good
so grab a pack and get jamming
youll definitely want to check these out
i ordered these for my husband the guitar player
he said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great
great strings with a good feel to them
they are size 1046 which is just right for my electric guitars
most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others
a few are actually a notchabove the others
these nyxls from daddario are definitely in that notch above category
i plan to stick with them
these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing
they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck
sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time
these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used
less time tuning  more good time playing
allinall i found no flaw in these strings
until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them
im a long time daddario user
09s to try on my strat and the
currently theyre 1199 on here compared to 499 or less for the regular version
so if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration
ive used daddario strings for years and they never fail me
10 but the led doesn8217t lie and it confirmed
i put the nyxl set on my ibanez artist with dimarzio  humbuckers
i like a rich tone with some high end but without too much 8216klang8217
to them i8217d say these are worth checking out
ive been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel
i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome
i cant comment on how long theyll last or keep in tune
but for now im impressed
every once in awhile ill step outside of my box
i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them
i use daddario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics
i like fender bullets on it
so the sample from the vine
and im the better for it
this set is no exception
highly recommend anything by d addario
for a long time i never thought much about guitar strings
i pretty much thought they were all the same
in fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days
the feel is different and the sound is different
different in a wow way
yeah theyre more expensive but theyre worth it
im a cheapskate and i cant go back to cheap strings
now im spoiled and ive become a guitar strings snob
my father is a fulltime gigging musician primarily on steel guitar and telecaster
these are outstanding strings with great durability playability and exceptional sound
well worth the extra investment
daddario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around
when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldnt be hype
like they were custom made for your guitar
im going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good
i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p90 pickups
they had some great 34spank34 and sounded great
excellent tone and im a bit surprised by that
these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver
rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain
these strings really do feel and sound great
ive been stringing my guitars with daddario for several years
but why not give these lighter strings a try
the quality is obviously high
tone is good as is durability
but fat or skinny daddario makes some of the best strings out there
dont get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable
this is a good string
great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced
pretty deluxe strings for the price here on amazon
daddarios nyxl1046 nickel plated electric guitar strings i have the light are the best
ive got them on my fender strat
ive never used strings that bend so well
these are miracle strings in my mind
most importantly they sound great
just put these on my martin dcx1e and they sound great
playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking
i cant say if they last longer vine has us review this asap
after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning
that being said my go to strings are still daddario
i ordered this for my husband the musician
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
he would definitely purchase this product
and hes pretty picky about his guitar strings
somehow i had gravitated over to other brands including martin and daddario
elixer definitely still has the edge
i cant speak on the claim for a longer string life
the strings are true to elixirs quality and tone
these strings sound great plug and unplugged
i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too
there are tonal differences as expected
the 8020 are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp
i didnt notice any difference to the feel of the string
as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years
time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions
for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb
youre still getting a good deal
great product with nice feel and tone
im only sorry i preordered only two sets at 1249
the average price now is 15 and over
ill bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out
hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings
these are durable and long lasting
so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar
i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge
053 strings in both phosphor bronze and 8020 bronze
the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f47 rc guitar
it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway
the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce
the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone
the nanoweb coating is nice
again 8020s are recommended for mahogany guitars
the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson
it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play
more profit in someones pocket for marketing jargon
012s ive been using which i think i liked a lot better
i put these strings on my guild acoustic electric
they are made by taylor and all taylor guitars come with elixir strings
these are very good longlasting strings
to me daddario are just as good
things like strings and picks are subjective
try different brands to find what suits you best
i ordered this for my husband the musician
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
he would definitely purchase this product again
they are even smoother and easier to play that i remembered them
elixer definitely still has the edge
true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound
i cant speak to the string life
so far now they sound great feel great
ive used elixirs for about five years now
phosphor bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars imho
these are great strings worth the money and sound great
im a daddario man myself but hey free is free
so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out
still there is no reason to fear trying these elixirs out
i really like these strings
they will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x
bottom line is elixirs sound great play well and least a really long time
i have lots of friends who play these strings
some love them more than any other string and some are like me
these strings softened the tone which i wasnt looking to do
these strings did neither for me
however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp
i rate them excellent in that category
but for me tone is 80 of the equation
id play wirewrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings
in the tonal category these strings fell short
the nanowebs went on my 1970s guild d35
both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars
if they d35 sounded dull id notice
016 of the daddarios i usually play
the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges
so how do they sound
i wouldnt call them dull by any stretch of the imagination
so theyre good sounding strings and they last a long time
ill update this review when i find out just how long they do last
whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar
somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom
not that i hated them just didnt really love them
these are the best ones ive tried so far
well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars
the promise is a 34bolder high end fuller low end34
i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars
i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings
i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs
i recently picked up an 812ce first edition 12fret
such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hds
but as far as sound they are great
that is what i notice most from the hds compared to the regular
so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain
try them out and make your own decision
these strings are really quite good but i wouldnt call them perfect
this is the only complaint i have about these strings
if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be 5star strings
as it stands i give them 45 stars
not a big knock actually
the lowend on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm
the sound is very big full and nice
