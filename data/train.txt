not sure what to do now
in addition snarks customer service was very friendly and helpful
works as expected and should last a really really long time
id play wirewrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings
not much to say about patches
i will buy another one of this
now i have more confidence with this strap
im glad i did because its really great
i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in
and this is the best price ive found
dont expect miracles but this helps quite a bit
i intentionally got the jf02 after reading positive reviews all over the net
the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors
having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards
in a band mix im pretty sure it would get totally lost
and it sounds just as good as major brands
these were filler items for a much larger purachse
it looks feels and sounds amazing
theres no instruction which is fine
it is small easy to read and use
highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro
its a good quality great sounding tube
other than that its a great device
to your weekly moving equipment caravan
elixir has excellent quality control too
however compared to elixers the sound just isnt as 34full
this one surpassed my expectations
i am in agreement with others that state this is a musthave
it has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse
this is a very very nice guitar strap
i got this item much quicker than i expected
i dont have any real praise or complaints about this
thats quite shocking considering how long the usb 20 standard has been around
im glad i tried these i wont order them again
there is no noise or other problem so far
the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles
i own two of these
just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair
for me thia is the best cables ever
anyway focusrite does which is one reason i trust them a little more
works solid looks solid and had a good price
overall this is good but not great
the factory battery lasted about 1 hour
windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately
amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem
one concern is that the linked power cables dont have anyplace to disappear into
i have two ibanez and two essex basses
cant tell if its truly working on my maple wood ukulele
in addition i couldnt use those on my acoustics
the cheap china copies on ebay dont fit
this is a really nice music stand
these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price
going to upgrade electronics and everything else too
otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of frail and bedazzled
fits nicely into my acoustic guitars
lots of sounds in this unit
dont waste your money on them
teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks
wonderful price and great product
they are always good quality
anyway i ended up keeping the guitar a jackson dk2m
so you can save money on that
a little flimsier than the at but at the price its good
it truly makes the task many times easier
not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a 90 guitar
i will be buying more for all my guitar cases
i saw this and had to try it
highly recommended by all serious ukulele players
in fact i dont hear any interference at all even with a single coil
48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain
the whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube
which is a common complaint and indicative of gfss crummy products in general
i have an maudio black box which had a peculiar size plug
this cable is complete garbage
it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks
this is a very good piece of equipment for its price
so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over
might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses
fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain
terrific trippy pearl tones and azures
the celluloid one fell apart quickly so i wanted a better material
if anything i try to err on the side of low
it has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come
these things grab the mic and wont let go
highly recommended for acoustic guitar players
the color of the device
will be buying more in the future
i have an older version of this model but it works great
great way to wake up the kids
the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly
works as expected and should last a really really long time
the name is somewhat misleading
straight into a guitar amp it gave plenty of volume
it is well worth the money
but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip
i would buy this again or recommend to anyone
if theres even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it
its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark
nice hardware on this case
60 nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection
does what it says it will do and it does it very well
i dont know much about delay and ive never really used it
they are still supple and easy to wind up
oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills
listening to music on them is a joy
the ds1 does not warm up the tone in your amp
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today
i bought a second pair of these
great laser nice big fat stars red and green worth the money
fantastic deal for this cable
the final time i tightened them down the high e string broke
this is an overpriced item
its a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done
lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible
the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday
also considering the lunchbox extension cab
string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad
one hinge broke after about a year of normal use
its hard to call it any particualr sound
better yet refund my money for the product i paid  minus shipping
only slightly better than 05
i ordered this for my jackson dkmg
its a good brand too
the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing
the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus
its still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting
i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tonesustain
a 2 item cost 1770 for shipping
they were already worn out
makes the strings nice and easy to fly over
takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar
i used alaska picks for years which are very good
why do you have to be so difficult
doesnt say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned
di am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however
the whole strap is leatherno adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument
tones bands specific songs sounds
the best eb slinkys ive ever used
nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well
the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb
first the goods  sturdy leather construction just cant be beat
price cant be beat either
and for the fact it was cheaper than most
so i sent them back
its the same as the one amazon is selling here
straplocks came with black  white felt thats a nice touch
the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed
my son loves them both
these really are a good set of strings
i also tried high and low but set it back to middle
i wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar
for 10 bux each  why not
this is definately worth the money
it works great on both
then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick
i use this on my takamine and my tele
the strap button has a radius about 316ths of an inch
no problem with any chemical reactions
this is without a doubt the best guitar tuner i have ever used
it sounds for the most part in tune and its tone is great
now mine closes without pressure on the bridge
also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical
nothing but praise goes to the supplier  kdm distributors
this is just what i have been wanting for a while now
i mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments
and it stays in tune nicely too
with these i found myself overshifting both high and low
so izm thanks hde for wasting my time
the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined
takes a matter of moments and works great
honestly the best effect it held was the phaserjet pipe effect
these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound
bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic
it is a great option if not simply the best
the pick pocket is a nice extra
comfortable and easy to adjust for length
i really like the deluxe bags by fender
mine seems to be fine doesnt look or feel flimsy at all
has a very solid base
the leather itself isnt a bad quality but its not the finest
you cant go wrong here
what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently
getting ready to make few ukes and it will tune them also
34 all of my other cables work with my geetar
good sound and the feel is good
these deliver on both counts
youll know its on by the tone change and the bright led light
i ordered with my new guitar
years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap
on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble
easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings
ill prob use it with my upgrade
overall product quality is good
strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player
they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price
ive used the classic kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars
like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds1
free shipping for prime members
but for everyone else including fortunate children the current mini is a sweet ride
i think this is my fifth behringer pedal
this has been very helpful for me to check finger position
capacitor are a nice generalized  choice
ive read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also
they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product
one issue is that this is not a plugandplay device
i know it will perform
solid well padded sturdy latches and everything lines up
we are talking about major bugs here
i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag
the strap is strong and well made
and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box
the ultimate in low tech
youll definitely want to check these out
much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage
to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone
this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion
i plan to buy more of these in the near future
for my practices and rehearsals i want to travel light
on the positive action and intonation good
this one is done right
its heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off
this is one pedal that will stay on my board
i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs
its great just like its advertised
i was rather skeptical of this little box amp but it works great
the only complaint ive heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight
i bought this boost to use in one specific situation
well worth the money spent
this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones
been buying them ever since and love them
the most recent one i purchased was not this one
nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price
just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more
first saw on youtube video how genius
i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex
it has compression exciter  deesser as well as eq and reverb
ill stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser
i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite
its simple well made and works great
i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off
that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does
there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments
xlr is a better quality than other connections
for someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal
when the needle is dead center the string is tuner
i could not believe it
plus the added gag of tiny ukulele  tiny amp always draws a laugh
my favorite pick out of this bunch was  the dunlop jazz 3 pick
legs open to set up easy
just changed strings on my epi les paul and this windercutter performed flawlessly
tung sol knows how to do it
i play while im watching the news
im really happy with this pedal
2  the chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough
it may just be my style
ive got a gig tomorrow night so well see how they work then
i found the mic tuner isnt as accurate
ive been happy with them so far
i highly recommend this product
looks good and has the fender logo prominent
i really couldnt find anything wrong  with it
despite this the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good
a pick that stays in hand
with drum pads i basically either get 0 velocity or max
it folds and is definitely portable
it clips to my guitar strong and stays put
great deal for the price
in all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick
this tuner the snark fits on my godins small headstock with no problems
if that turns out to be a problem i might reconsider my review
im gonna try to heat these so i can stretch them a bit
i see other reviewers having issues
may work other applications that require the same type of plug
it will tune practically anywhere   loud rooms etc
check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing
i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself
for the money you cant beat this cable
hands down the best cables for electric guitar
fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one
you can move from string to string quick
if not you can find a lot better head stands
i had previously been using the korg ga1 which is a fine basic tuner
it was even sorta in tune
i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it
for distortion look at other boss pedals
i restrung my martin 016ny with these strings and found them to be excellent
new straps seem to be easier to secure
the tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough
for everyone else look elsewhere
that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time
that huge box is then inside yet another huge box
and this is my favorite victim
it fits beautifully and powers all of them at once
ive used daddario strings for years and they never fail me
holds up great mic does not slip
this is my favorite pedal
and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer
they have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better
what the crap are they talking about
i like the dunlops feel grip and durability
its light and has great sound for interviews
i use mine all the time between different alternative tunings
you can spend hours finding 34your sound34 or just 34the sound34 that you need
i do a single duo and full band
easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general
big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel
i love this new one
it does almost everything i need
save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this
this is an awesome amp
very light which is nice
because it is cotton this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps
update  this pedal has since been returned
i did not need it for that
i have used these strings since they first came out
wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night
pivots in 1 direction only
switch it for this black one
just got my stand today
no fuss no muss no fooling around
i couldnt get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal
at the music store i stumbled on the dunlop gator grip 20
the price on amazon is awesome
there is no difference in the sound at all
itll keep me busy for a long time
although the machine itself is good the accompanying documentation is awful
these sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report
this are some great strings
but626262it has true fender quality
so far this has been the most impressive of the options offered
but again reasonable minds can differ
sometimes people dance right in front of us
anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane
i didnt have near as much string stretch with these either
it just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands
this is the only guitar ive used them on but they sound great
overall great buy for a cheap little money saver
there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop
there is no noise or hum
overall i think this is a great product
after testing each of the tripod stands
no reason to be out of tune with these tuners
that said the pedal is great
also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet
very pleased with timely arrival of the package
try a set and see what i mean
would i try another pick if the chance was presented
theyre round and they fit over microphones
my guitar was made in china which may account for the darker hue
this was the first time i ventured into the world of harp
this particular one is just ok
very happy with these cables
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way
still needed a nice touch
this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to
the planet waves capo definitely gives the kyser a run for its money
california with the classic fender name scribed
received this item in good time
hes not a big kid so even 15lb
so its back to the fenders
our buy two more of these they are only 20 bucks
the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find
easy to use very low price classic sounds
okay i keep getting off topic here
ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos
i use it with the medium dunlop picks
i use them all winter long in my guitars
all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist
these strings are quite durable and longlasting
i am proud to have this product
i always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal
one of my favorite pedals of all time
sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs
i believe it is 100 sturdy and reliable
im a small woman and i really like that the neck is smaller
this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters
but ive never played a set of this brand that i didnt like
so far this board has performed superbly
i bought 2 to try them out and i intend on buying more
buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldnt have any worries
it is of average quality but for the price i wasnt expecting much
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good
a very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many
works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg
well i must say i am very happy with the purchase
after watching a side by side comparison on youtube i decided to buy one
i will never be without one again
when i run it alone to my crate i havent experienced this
the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards
well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks
i will order a smaller size
nothing to special but it was good enough for that
i bought this cable for my bands live show setup
ill be buying and recommending these for a long time
now if only all windscreens were this sturdy id be a happy customer
however once clipped properly you shouldnt have issues
the possibilities are limited only to your imagination
i really like this stand
awesome with my ltd vc401 with 59 and jb pickups
buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer
enter the fender frontman 212r
very sheep relatives with the quantity
this is one lush pedal and its all analog
even with that issue i think the jam is a good value
when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue
we custom manufacture insert cables for custom soundreinforcement fixed installations
these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price
lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months
promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it
this one came up in the specs of doing just that
i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under 5 minutes
this strap is sturdy and robust and its plain black
by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic 300b
some of the drives are usable
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments
these strings sound light and bright
the hardware is what you would expect from a yamaha product
when i saw these things a light came on in my head
heavy construction in layered leather
a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week
i have several epiphone 335 dots and a gibson es335
it was also a tight fit
it is consistent easy to use and compact
i see no flaws on my banjo
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
i dont believe i would buy again until a sealed container is provided
the 34strat34 is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard
could not be any happier
i guess it really revolves around your personal needs
awesome for chord based songs
if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it
still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar
we bought this rack tray for our sons new sound rack
but for now i am very pleased with this tuner
it did what i wanted  then some
but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls
it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints
well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa
it is easy to assemble
well you get what you pay for  leather looking paper wouldnt hold guitar
where the stand shines if micing amps
this left me to the old plug and chug method
and why do these cost so much more anyhow
not much to say here
if youre looking for a budget increase of tone
but the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it
does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar
i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them
compared to ernie balls cloth its good enough for wiping down things
this brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings
it has geared tuners not friction pegs
a buddy of mine got one and hes killing it on the bends
it hasnt given him any problems so far
nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible
sounds like and plays like a les paul
this strap is very comfortable
would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling
i used this and the color became rich and less dry
the case is also really well made good zippers and stitching
i cannot recommend it strongly enough
it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones
very portable though the holder can be a challenge at times
what more could you ask for
these strings are great with my acousticshowever lately ive been using electric strings instead
ive been using these strings for years
wow i will never buy another sm57 again
another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic
i had other cables on my pedal boards
if you jump over to these http www
ive been using this for years
they last longer than most other brands ive used
i have never been let down by ernie ball strings
no way this thing cost lest than 40
this attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter
you might end up with 6 like meor morein no time
if you are looking for a 100 leather mandolin strap consider another strap
thats 5 stars in my book
the jf02 is truly my favorite right now
however range of motion is on the wide side
i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds
vibe is very trower like
rotomatics will go on every guitar build i do
their differences for your  ears
i wanted to do it through my maudio profire 610
it is not so long as i thought
no popping or clicking at all
theyre durable and have a long battery life
the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom
i never give anything a 100
great for a beginner electric
prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping
i thought the boss pedal sounded pretty bad
this works perfect with the quick release system i also purchased
this means their stuff is made to last
i got this to use with my 12 string
i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels
this is a pick holder
super cool pedal with tons of applications
however there are workarounds like just switching tracks
battery runs out fast so get an ac adaptor
either that or theyre comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue
i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains
i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly
you can just plug in your guitar or bass
but to my luck i found out what the problem was
to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer
com when i did and will not part with the amp
this is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price
why no 5 star review
the noise suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise
this is thicker than the
its easy to forget its there
one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings
finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless
phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap
very quick reaction to string
plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor
i have stopped using asio4all and i get decent latency
hasnt had any problems with it
not the least bit stiff like some leather products
the windings brokeon the dstring at two places where the string fretted
but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder
i figured he could start simpler
they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed
they stil play great sound great against steel strings and last a long time
i dont like them at all
i always use the 100mm for guitar had to test them with bass strings
sorta disappointed with it over all
i use earnie ball strings as my backup strings
easy to set mic slides in or out up or down
the star of the joyo lineup however is arguably the jf02 ultimate drive
works so much better than the string around the neck thing
ive been recording using garage band
this unit sounds good and is adjustable
its a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass
this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick
so dont want 9s and 10s too tight then 95s it is
we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom
shipping was fairly fast and its ready to use straight out of the package
five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs 12 shipped
its likely theyll keep this style but revise it some
2 the bass cut and presence boost are convenient
the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend
that may change along the way
i will have to replace it soon
they all work well are well constructed and are a good value
so i must say im summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings
this one works better than the smaller rubber ones
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
instead it produces a warm oldtime overdriven tone
these guys did a super job getting them here fast
it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on
i seem to have bad luck with electricacoustic guitars when purchased through amazon
i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible
are hard to beat when it comes to durability
the capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck
i always felt 100 secure with these straplocks
the teens really liked the colors to choose from and i like the price
it does what its designed to do
this is a tough unit easy to set and locks tight
after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug
it does what it is supposed to
i guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag
does exactly what it says itll do
great upgrade for squier telecasters
the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems
havent played the toy harps yet first things first
it offer a lot of variations in echo delay types
a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows
im using these on the mandolin
no metallic hiss youd normally expect
well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals
filters out the pop sounds
my bassplaying has gone on for 50 years
as easy as the little round ones from snark
this pedal is really small in size has one knob  the footswitch
well made product strong and looks good
the perfect wall mount for a ukulele
bass only  take it or leave it
treat the light like it has no bag and youll be fine
but recently my life changed a little bit
this cable only works with dynamic microphones
built well sounds good and does what youd expect
this is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars
i got what i paid for
thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars
looks nice and works as intended
it makes working with a condenser mic easier
as close to a rack mount as it gets
great idea in different colors
ive been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago
i bought a glaesel bridge  this glaesel rubber mute together
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you
this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat
this is a good string
i only spent 859 for this and im mad at myself
its also a good choice for women
so thanks to amazon for making this possible
i used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month
i have many different makes of power supplies
without the update this tuner was borderline terrible
this is the best usb microphone out for under 100 bucks
it does very well with single coils
for now i would say buy one
but this will more than meet your needs to use at home
these folks should be embarassed
if you have no sense of smell get one
i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it
i set up a shootout in my studio
all this pedal does is perform volume swells
if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have
the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light
great vocal and guitar sounds
got this stand to mount a studio projects c1 condenser mic
i wouldnt buy anything but elixirs for years
good price for an pack of pickups
ok ive owned 2 of these danelectro amps
compared these all in medium
it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp
works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars
going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones
but it eats batteries like they were candy
i have been using them for about 6 months
are there better tube screamer clones out there
i prefer 12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands
it took me two hours to get it all working
my violins tone doesnt change much at all with this mute
a great amp for practice and beginners
after that your record will sound brand new again
i was pleasantly surprised to find it wellmade with a clean simple appearance
holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well
knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm
this fender is lots better then my other bag
the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze
theres a highpass filtertremendously useful when rumble is a problem
if it was a choice between the 2 the planet waves wins hands down
was easy to adjust and is very stable
otherwise it would be a 5 star
the tone destroys the line 6 and the features crush the vox pathfinder 6watt
im glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup
ernie ball 2223 super slinky electric strings
its just a great option to have for casualbudget guitarists
turns out they are talking about a completely different item
i dont regret my decision this pedal sounds great
overall it is a bargain for the price
works like the picture shows
really i cant tell that they do
firm fit solidly molded ends reputable branded cable
the top gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well
rocks my world and back to the garden
it is light weight just the right size
its as versatile as can be
beyond great tone  playability these suckers are reliable as all getout
the ultimate guitar cleaning tool i love love love this kit
on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy
concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger
this is a cheap guitar in every way
it doesnt happen when i boost my overdrives ocd  hardwire cm2
a lot of nice features
my only complaint is i didnt like the clean sounds not to my liking
but the biggest con is
pay the extra money and get this set
im a stickler for the oem parts so i typically by only fender stuff
its easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops
for the price you cant go wrong
just another 20 output would make these 5 stars perfect
line 6 has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones
may not for very big guitar neck
the choice is yours there
im sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar
while the product is everything it said it would be
i like the grippiness of them
this was like 35 and sounds awesome
there is a volume knob but no independent basstreble adjustment as on other monitors
if it works correctly ill update this review after doing a few recordings
for me that answer is a clear yes
just was not what i was hoping for
ive had two of these tuners
looks like a whole new guitar now
on that level this strap succeeds
wow these are some good sounding strings
ive heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why
i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned
most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med
a very wellmade strap with great looks and a super price
i wanted an upgrade to my tu2 which i had for years
i was playing a gig at a small pub
the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think 34perfect34
built in tuner works great
could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box
something else that weighed into my purchase was durability
this product is easy to use without any noise at all
if high gain is what your after then stay away
this pack comes with 6 picks
but those are mostly minor gripes
it does a fine job
if you need a tube screamer
the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey
well the gibson cloth does have a whipstitch edging around it
that said i purchased this for my home recording studio
this microphone in just a few words is awesome
now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want
there isnt much to say about this product except it works as advertised
whats also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included
maybe its a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric
if you want to get humidity into a guitar this product is a must
the only string ill use
they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings
right out of the box everything about the instrument was spoton
its well constructed and i have not encountered any issues with the twopiece bottom
these daddario  strings are great
if i buy another it would be a standard hanger
the two things i was looking for
after researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever i chose the fulltone ocd
if you play the blues
this is an excellent alternative to using it as a usb device
the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible
a budget this is your mic
that doesnt make it worse or better just different
the snark sn8 delivered on both counts and more
they now ship without the clips
it is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera
i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars
havent found any others that sound and feel so good
was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this
i would definitely buy a few more of these
i have purchased several amps over the last 7 months see the reviews
this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun
my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great
i have seen people complain about battery life
and when you attach the headphones it works great
this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested
this was my first guitar
i think this guitar rest is pretty nice
a must for pedal boards
tune in and check it out i think you will agree
i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts
very forgiving on technique also
it was my favorite capo
it may even give you aids
great for beginners and experts
i love how hefty they are
with this pedal its easy
this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion
they have been around a long time and hold up well with time
i may have simply gotten a defective one
i suspect that most folks will want less of this than more
if it matters to you the white ends are very well white
will go find real headphones thanks
not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints
for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions
i keep in e flat tuning and it stays
after trying to use it i promptly returned it
got it to my door for 304
maybe a preamp would have helped
i am so extremely happy with them
its almost like picking with with just your fingers except with more volume
fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind
amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good
price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo
no complaints about this hardware
and as an end user a upc sticker serves nobody
these elliptical pins are great
with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else
as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and roadrugged
i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it
i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p
it is extremely silent save any noise i would generate anyway from my rig
plastic comb with no recess
well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations
play on guitar rig and amplitude
i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday
nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb
i give them four stars
for the fender stat it works just great
here is a comparison of the jp02 chameleon and the onespot
these make great and affordable mic cables
i know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile
youll get latency with any type of recording device
it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism
i recommend these picks without reservation
my frist guitar strap i like it alot
physically it is built strong too
blue tape both sides as to prevent marring
so reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding
for 22 bucks cant really go wrong
it is limited in what it can do but it does the job
i love the selfratcheting feature of the g7th
so the padding material coating could have been better made
very easy to tune my basses
normal plush fake fur inside with about 34 of soft foam all around
for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase
i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up
using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical
no noise or hum whatsoever
what more do i need to say
this is a great complement to study theory
aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal
this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewines books and it works great
i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back
then its the wrong amp
find the same slide in large and i wrote a complimentary review there
best sounding vocal mike for the bucks
seems to be better quality than other cheaper products i researched
if yore looking for a new strap i highly recommend this one
id allways come back to daddarios
just a great chorus with not much to tweak
whether thats a good thing
it sturdy and good quality
thats at the 25 gain setting
the cord that comes with it is worth more than that
i have bought the red blue and older black models
other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle
actually it was really easy to install
09 strings without additional hardware
i tried different basses with it
and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo
so that is the downside
just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc
best strap available for the price
it also holds my water bottle with no problem
i got these because they were recommended replacements for the fostex t50rp
its hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect
other than the color theres nothing wrong with them
i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably
nice materials and i think it will be durable
i have a pigtronix philosophers tone  it made a big differrence
i can still use this but hardly
i would highly recommend this pedal
the plastic thumbpicks match tone very well
i have returned the unit
they sound so full and strong
at this price hard to complain too much
good quality strong and excellent finish
it will not dry out and lasts for years
this is a great capo
the cable works fine and is very flexible
even without a guitar and an amp its still fun to have
i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought
i use the 21 cable
seems to me as good as any connector ive ever bought
but finally you get over that but seriously its huge
whereas this does the job
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
not for guitars with nitro finish
a super cool little tin
something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning
this keeps me from adjusting my amp each time i switch guitars
i love my snark sn5 tuner
bass tones response and resonance are superior to my ear
this is one of the best pedals i have on my board
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
shines up guitars very nice
the quality is obviously high
they do make noise kind of like an old album
easy to put on and take off
was upgrading the chrome on an mim
first let me tell you what this pedal cant do
this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals
works great seems durable shipped fast
i bought this just to see what everyone was raving about
im using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement
gets the job done and it is inexpensive
2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars
i did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size
being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning eadgbe
its made pretty well for a plastic tool
one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass
what more could you ask
like many i cannot afford a tube amp
iif the strings break i will try this one gs330s as well
best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off
the sn1 is a musthave as far as im concerned
the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly
typical british growl at higher gain settings
this pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans
im using it more then i thought i would when i first bought it
this is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should
my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively
there was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke
they suit my playing style well
at shows i rely on a tu2 stompbox for tuning
all in all a perfect buy for the money
i have never had one break
the capo looks nice and works without any problem
this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings
good price for a good product
i bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price
if you use various guitars on gigs this pedal is very useful
i mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do
i really cant say enough positive things about the apogee jam
i have 4 kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect
with this my voice is strong and clear
i usually buy locally but the deal here was great
the light works really well and that was what i was looking for
its easy for him to use and adjust
the tuners are kind of choppy
easy to mount solid grip on guitar
the external power brick for this guy seems fragile
i like the product a lot
lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference
can sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars
excellent strap for the money
i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary
for what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of you cant beat it
its comfortable and you can wear it for hours
ive used stands for over 27 years and this is the best ive owned
tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing
yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers
what about the boss me70
youve got to get this pedal
comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it
very similar to a ehx memory man it does it all
i couldnt put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars
the bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine
this guitar will make you a more versatile player
generally five or six at a time in various locations
ill decide which to use round or half wound after my experiment
i tested this capo on several guitars and with one exception it worked well
only problem is the strings
they last and they stay in tune
finally settling on this cherry burst lp100
i am going to purchase another one for my guitar
the tuner hole size is
the ac3 does that job
i have not noticed any sound degradation from using it
not really that good for  music
at least try a new tube before giving up
in the tonal category these strings fell short
so i cant speak to its durability at this time
ive used ernie balls on electrics for even longer
sounds amazing in any combo
im just glad that i got one of these from amazon
again its very good at what it does if you dont power the microphone
brass color lock that comes with it
i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping
its not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock
as clean as a marsh possum
i purchased four and they were all delivered on time
price was good for a useful accessory
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ x2
21234 width worked well for me compared to the 434 version
i took a look at it and knew i had to have one too
these picks are a good change of pace
i got this for christmas and would shop around a lot more
attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice nonslip surface
more for the intermediate musician
this is certainly your metallica amp
i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one
for it being pretty cheap i had to get it
glad i invested in it
the threads are smaller on these
i also gave it the nose test
i have tried several rosins for my violin
from very thin and flexible to 08 and hard you get a selection
i especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner
it has a rich full bodied sound
it effectively quiets all my other pedals
it does a marshall pretty well
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars
i have several gls cables and have zero complaints
good product so far just wouldnt recommend it
this is the best capo ive ever owned
latest review the product is back at 5 stars
recently acquired an ovation mandolin which itself is hardly 34standard34 in appearance materials etc
they have very little string squeak
if you wanted to tune and didnt have a 14 input good luck
still suck at bending 3 4
they sound great to me personal opinion of course and are priced right
i got both hi and lo g sets
depending on your style these might be a good choice
i do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable
versus the godlyke id say this is the better purchase
i thought they were all great
the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping
put it on the headstock
this thing uses tiny smc components in the circuitry and therefore isnt really moddable
i was a little disappointed
love that i didnt have to assemble this stand
distortion pitch shifter chorus then out
i would recommend these for any guitar player
i just wish i had found this guitar sooner
nice and thick the adhesive is very strong
just play one acdc riff into the 70s amp and youll recognize the sound
this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured
in fact it works really nice
thats how much of a difference these strings make
i bought a set of these to try them out
the clear ring of the martins i normally use
i usually use martin sps but i decided to give these a try
it is a 5star product
it gives me great sounds
straight from the case these dont bend well but do not despair
and screamythe fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes
all i can say is wow
the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip
update  too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also
they are good and reasonably priced
these mics are the best mic for the buck out there
its a very solidly made stand
all i own are mogami cables
these hold up great year round
i bought this guitar humidifier for my taylor
these are by far my favorite picks
i use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there
but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction
perfect for ibanez guitars with special tuning
overall a four stars product imo
whats not to like here
it appears a little thinner than the original and just doesnt look as 34original34
for the price im really happy
i use it for podcasting purposes
the max grip just is very difficult to drop effortless to hold on to
dont quote physics to me
but over time this starts to disappear
i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively
whatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
theres not much to say except that it get the job done very well
truss rod is behind a nice body color plate
i recommend it to all aspiring musicians
for me this one is just right
get them if you like gilmour
one of the the best lights i own
this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well
the entire tuner clipped onto the instrument
it will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar
i immediately noticed a difference in the quality fullness and volume of my amp
ive been using the dunlop delrin 500 20 picks
feels solid and stays in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions
attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system
i may buy some more of them
overall impression  the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives
this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for
king of the practical tuner world
for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use
a cheap guitar at best
i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out
there were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price
so expect it to be a different color than what you order
it is one of the best value i have purchased
b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal
the answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking for
virtually every genre is represented here
if you play fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings
maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise
the mini tone master delivers well
i recently acquired a vox valvetronix ad100vt combo amp from my local music shop
quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
i read several reviews before purchasing these strings
buy this if you want a started that isnt bobo or a toy
you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop
there are however a few limitations
the pickups are surprisingly good
i just wish it had a power switch
its my best acoustic currently
my setup is a very simple one
you can get some insane sounds out of it
unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it
it included a multiplug cable but not a right angle one
they last keep in tune and keep their tone
the amp has light sound and not much control
i use this microphone mainly to record music
there are better deals for just slightly more money
you get the best bang for your buck with boss products
you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it
daddarios nyxl1046 nickel plated electric guitar strings i have the light are the best
my previous tuner was a korg ca40 and frankly that tuner is terrible
itll serve its purpose until i can afford a real american strat
he would definitely purchase this product again
overall this is a pretty good stand
im a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished
dont spend 200 on a boutique pedal  get this one
everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable
heavier than the m1 but it sure doesnt feel like it
i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries
34 and it certainly did
i must say though that i had no idea it would be so huge
10 mm is the perfect combination
that said ill say again the straplok system is a great product
over all im happy with the purchase as it suits my needs
i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction
if youre looking to recreate the edge sound analog delay is not for you
well made cable with bulletproof molded ts protection
one section of this wheel lists all of these different scales
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all
holds the guitar out at a safe distance
highly recommend for budget tuner
how far wrong can you go for 183
i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions
id buy this again for sure
i bought this to go with my shure sm58s
i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background
easy to use and very secure
this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments
oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech
and the noiseless feature is priceless
that song along should keep my practicing for a long time
im hoping they last a while
not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there
so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper
but if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse
best of all the price
i just dont like the features of this stand at all
and this amp is so accurate that i can
get a roadie to do it for you
based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a nobrainer
i have tried it several times and it just doesnt tune right
the only weak point is the somewhat thin mid cut toggle switch
since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try
leaving me with the same music and way less background noise
as for size its designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars
it was a great item
great picks would buy em again
stock strings have a warm tone
a boss eq is solid and all yes but cost alot more
i use the fender for electric and the behringer for the acoustic for practicing
the push down applicators dunlops dabomatic applicator tops are horrible idea
it does what it should do
these suckers are wonderfully reliable
i am amazed by this amp
so i sent it back
the snark sn1 is by far the best
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought
i only wish that more came in a single pack
this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components
this is an interesting limited effect pedal
all the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid
but what else can you expect from a us company like gibson
these are the only picks i use
highly recommended for the price
they should have put it higher up right next to the dial
keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential
but you dont really need it that much anyways
havent tried the trumpet yet
if you really need some get some more substantial pads
the price is good i bought it locally for the same price here
was really impressed to see it in action
they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective
so far ive dropped mine once with no damage
these can take it and come back for more
that being said the materials are decent
i would pay twice that for what this pedal does
i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago
the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp
i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin 016ny
maybe it just needs to be broken in
it also is bright and is very accurate
it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints
its nice and does its job
overall though a great value for a quality cable
the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate
too bad so sad for them
couldnt ask for more in a momentary switch
this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand
in a much much more obvious way3
it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion
folds compact to fit in your guitars hard case or gig bag
why are you still reading this
to me thats just freaking incredible
i would still prefer classic style
i have several behringer pedals and other behringer equipment
they look great up on the wall
not worth the purchase in my opinion
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano
in 23 years my tastes may change
this guitar stand does not find hidden treasure
that said the digitech express xt is a little better
the strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what i needed
behringer has never been very documentation oriented
im not a fenfer fan but i really love this tuner
sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron
see if i could improve the situation
these dunlops get it just right
seem to be of a good value
these new ehx pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass
this is the one pedal i cant do without
paired with the zero hum ac adaptor its a highly portable amp setup
man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy
and the action is now so smooth
however i returned them because they are not locking
inexpensive to purchase  easy to mod to your liking
i dont have any complaints
but jameson guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price
but however you use it it is sweet
to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip
be aware that this clutch has only two positions  open and fully closed
they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look
the great thing about it is the length
the result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars
even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal
thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt
this stand does its job quite well
a definate must for any guitar player
not so hard on the fingers
no this is not the same as actually being loud
the main issue is the sound
good quality material ensures i wont be needing another set for a long time
the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
it works as it should
at least theres no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion
unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item
the 34fingers34 will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly
but you cant ask for much more for the price of 399
next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by its specs
theyre better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers
the jf15 was a curiosity purchase
its ready to gojust plug it into your laptop and start recording
it turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather
the rattle just got worse louder as i played
i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal
i tried all three modes  carodid carodid  10bd pad and omni
this stand does the trick beautifully
unlike product photo and it doesnt match all my other gator bags
i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner
i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade
however since i love my guitar i use it anyway
very good price and good performance
for those folks these will elimiate the resulting pings and such
i tried different cables with it
no problems with case or pedals
i own hundreds of picks
this is the best clip on tuner out there
this pedal really hits the spot
is that weird to say
if it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating
normal pickguard screws nothing special here
i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain
i popped my e string overtightening it when i was setting it up
also the edirol r09 is the darling of the moment
it was held by only one small tac weld
theyre wonderful folks and they do excellentlyaffordable work
this pedal adds that i dont know what to your sound
i am a novice guitar player
i am thinking of selling my bass
but this tool is very well designed
overall it wasnt a huge issue just a bit annoying
and i got a string cleaner by fender
this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar
reduces string noise as promised
the guitar touches the floor
my advice  dont even install the app from the included disc
rubber washers come with to size for different necks
ive been using this product for a while now
love it the display is cool and cant ask anything more
my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning
this is a very high quality strap
based on physical condition i would recommend this product
guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now
i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat
these tubes just arent for me
this pedal solved my problem with my amp
its well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to
this was exactly what i was expecting
you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 8899
other then that i like it and purcheased a second one
a pedal does not make you play better practice does
so what are the presets
worth every penny as long as it lasts
had to buy another one
because they are led the batteries last a long time
drducks wax is worth the extra 3
feels and looks good right out of the box
once you place the pedals on it its kinda heavy
the tone preservation is excellent and havent noticed any issues there
they cost more than the mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow
the one thats more universal
it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear
i definitely recommend trying out a set
it takes some doing to figure out which does what
they enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought
compact enough to stow it in a guitar case
ill be buying another one and trying it again
for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect
for electronics the voltage has to be correct
i have at least 5 of these
a piece of double stick tape shaped to match the pick holder is included
no pick noise just strings
it is very solid and will last a long time
thats where the yamaha really falls short
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another
but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else
screws just the right size
it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport
they are getting very very close to tube sound
i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value
for the price of these strings you cant go wrong
the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones
my title says it all
great little product and i would buy them again
this is just what it looks like  a very economical strap
this is a very nice dynamic mic
it holds your guitar up
they really are well shielded against rfi
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot
it is a single strip of leather with no padding
recently ive been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the
most importantly they sound great
stop looking and buy one
the length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children
fwiw i like my snarks better
i do dabble with the bass but im not proficient with it
i would order these again
good strings for the price nice ring to them
it does and it does it well
it might even be over 34engineered34 it fits so well
i liked my first one so much that i am putting in another order
as far as tuning goes i am very pleased
i think i saw micro and thought shorter
for regular sized picks its a perfect product
the speeds are from 40208 bpm
leave it in your car to practice at lunch
i would recommend them to all
i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent
keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking
ive reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them
they are an excellent value
i got what i ordered
but it does a good enough job for what it is
as i said the hardware on the case is really good
but for live playing its great
its a nice little amp good for carrying around
it has a cool name but thats about it
it will make any strat or tele build shine
this little stand is great
this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed
very sturdy well made product
i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike
60mm for a more raw folk like sound
had issues before with company but they resolved all issues
works really well considering how inexpensive it is
much to my surprise this cable is pro quality
these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality
34hey can we get blue turned down a little
i found it right here it  works well with no problems to report
it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too
the xlr male  the xlr female are well built
works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro
with intensity below 50 it was usable
for a cheap 808 clone this is the best i have used hands down
plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch
cable looks great  feels of high quality
i dont have to wait for it to snap back it doesnt bend
what more is there to say
still i cant fault its tuning prowess
clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers
behringer hit a home run with this one
however the snark sn2 just has the edge
one last thing  youve gotta love amazon
these schallers are exactly what i wanted
they have no coating  so they squeak like hell
the title says it all
sounds good and the action is smooth
it doesnt seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar
it delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me
i really wanted this to be a great product
i am a weekly player and have been for 40 years
it does 80s hair band and 80s metal very well
this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver
the guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible and that means
you will get 2000 worth of use out of it though for sure
very affordable and good quality
this is another useful item from planet waves for the guitar player
nice texture and it doesnt affect the sound of my mics
we had a birthday jam at a friends house
do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this
i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another
i like the fold up into a small package idea
i do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom
i still use both brands
these are nice easy to use capos and the price was great
besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss
hopefully behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price
ive had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great
instability incompatability and frustration abound with audio interfaces
as long as you dont drop it all the time it should be ok
exactly what i was looking for
ill have them with me for spares
so many functions and just a great design
a total loss  and we had no insurance we sure learned our lesson
ill use the case for my higher end hohners as needed
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion
i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass
they dont sound as crisp as the daddario strings
the block is full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles
this tuner is nice  inexpensive and very easy to use
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products have always presented
this is something i had not tried before
i ordered this as a spare and at this time i havent used it
this ukes sound is at least as good as a 50100 dollar uke
just to confirm several other reviews  these hangers are really nice
my wife made me try this for a gig we had
the behringer us600 is wellmade
great pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through
martin is a name that means quality
do yourself a favor and avoid them
excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend
how do you review an sm58
bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything
i would recommend this product to a friend
it does what its supposed to
the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo
i have 100 confidence this will never tip over on its own
always good to have a stationary mic on the floor
but there is no counterweight here so its best used at shallow angles
if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out
it also has a lock on the case in case one might need it
my best guess its playing style
ive found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more
so if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration
i ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks
i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer
alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flatpick drag
use this to record my guitar on garage band
i couldnt be happier with the seagull s6 especially for the price
but i just cant get myself to do it
this is a really nice product for the price
so if it isnt attached the the guitar it wont work
no trouble stringing or tuning either set
i really like the way the tungsol makes my jazzmaster sound
they will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic
easy to use and accurate
on that scale these strings would be above a literal medium
the behringer u control gives me stereo now
i cant write a great review for this
easy to put on and tune
the difference between this one and clamp on style is night and day
mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use
not great but not bad as well
a nice pedal to have to be sure
this one is harder to lose because of its size
this small stand does not hold most all ukes
easy to setup easy to use
planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well
the answer is it gets 4 stars
for sure a good buy
i have 3 of the danelectro effects pedals
a plugandplay usb device with both input and output audio jacks
obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer
it transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true pa
the next day the guitar neck looked and played great
xlr to xlr from mackie mixer to pylepro 1400 watt amp
the tension is a little tighter than id like but works for me
they are a little hard on batteries but not overly so
im just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone
id guess they have about 100 years of wear on them
i wouldnt take it on a tour or anything it is plastic
i keep it in my guitar case and use it often
several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound
and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section
couldnt pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price
if it sounds too good to be true it usually is
the added features are also a plus
this gives me the same recording ability 9624 but it is much less expensive
i may need new cables
the mxl fit like a glove perfect
my only complaint is the markings on the level knobs
i will definitely pick up more for my other axes
the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal
i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures
especially when it costs three times more
i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application
i bought two more you will love this tuner
their grip is excellent and they feel awesome
and if you goof and unplug it before powering it down no problem
the behringer ultracoustic at108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job
some other mxls like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end
or you have to find a case thats ultra thin
these have been ordered for a couple of weeks
i use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesnt fall
if you use more than 2 of 10 max gain it sounds awful
makes this great and i mean great microphone even better
i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would
aquila strings will never let you down
the included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes
now if only the price of pickupchics would come down
this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations
they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place
i love having two mic inputs and the cd input
being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild
i havent had any problems with them they installed just fine
i am very happy with it and thank you
and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer
especially when you take off the guitar for a break
take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy
it puts guitars into the best tune
the knobs are solid and work just fine
sturdy with adequate padding to protect my 34babies34
youll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum
this chromatic clipon tuner is the best of the best
does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal
i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro
there are different amp sounds you can get
guess thats why its so cheap
fret and its right on the 34money34
fender original parts cant be beat
metal case compact nice bracket lighted remote telling you when its ready
great foot rest its not flimsy
with the gain at halfway you get great addc crunch
i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk5 drum mic packagefor details
i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture
it works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas
also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel 2
purchased after another folding stand which cost the same  literally fell apart
some strings sound dull right out of the package
i bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp
this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid 4999
for the price this stand cant be beat
its a very noncolored sounding overdrive
i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection
2 1534 speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet
the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money
holds my seagal s6 very well
so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet
i tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both
ive had it for about a year now and have no complaints
decent strings i used for a beat up strat that i had
i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target
happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to
im very happy i bought them
i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily
picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps
this mic is built like a tank yes as others have said
its really smallnoticeably smaller than the red jazz iii picks
the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved
so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you
while the bx5a has a bigger tweeter separate xlr  trs jacks
great color and retro style as well
the only problem i have is it smells terrible
the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze
i have a dot studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly
the price is right and they keep them safely stored
please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones
i wrote to line6 and i got useless answers about
but for the price these are fine
almost time to order another set
it was defective in more than two areas
i like the look and feel of these
this is another in the mxr distortion line
they were perfect for my pedal board
as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach
glad i chose to purchase this cable
i have a wide variety of vic sticks that i bought here on amazon
the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesnt work very well
these speakers worked great for 14 months
its just ridiculous what is in this for 199
this one seem to perform just fine
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
i bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out
a three star at best
i can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail
these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment
ive owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime
this is one of its best features
easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight
i am learning to play the guitar
i got this because of the price
nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great
they give some versatility in their length
great bang for the buck clone of a tech 21 gt2
ive used these picks for years with great results
i was on the fence about whether it was my winner
great strap for the price
i am sure i will get more
the small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling
they are excellent quality clear tone and a great look
if youre new it helps you find what you like
you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive
while being light and portable
i shouldnt have to feel like this thing just barely fits me
it looks and feels great on my luna butterfly
its a cheap speaker stand
i use this on my 310 taylor with a kk pure pickup system
the paint fade away after a while but dont let that stop you
it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars
i have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench
work great for my needs
so that meant my inexpensive tuner wasnt nearly discriminating enough
it has to feel right
this is a decent buy below the two dollar level
ill update as to the answers and information provided
it of course uses the windows audio drivers
the ac adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness
if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic
this quality bag would probably cost more like 35 at your local music store
my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug
i bought my dad one too
i have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy
the price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner
these fit snug on my shure sm58 beta a mics
every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps
this is the first harmonica i ever used
its definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this
we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent
they had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support
these and the extra lights are great strings
you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy
i thought id miss it but i dont
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first
ive bought three for gifts
the jf02 is a really nice dirtbox  and not just for the price
sturdy provides good support and looks good
at the current price at the time of this review its a bargain
im told it sounds better now
i thought id try something else out and settled on this one
for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth  lol
comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters
the display is better than most ive used dating back 30 years
heres the deal with this pedal
the switch should be on the side of the unit
this simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables
but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more
they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too
i compared it to other poly straps i have and its ok
ive had a few of these things not all the same model
looks pretty neat along with the george ls cables that are almost invisible
im never playing another guitar without these locks
it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say
great portability for the price
i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions
this is a palnet waves and just as good as the more expensive ones
i bought this not knowing what to expect
011 gauge daddarios are good strings at a good price
the packaging was also a bit confusing
it was cheap and affordable
my thumbs arent tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average
which in the end is my concern
i have very small hands so they work for me
still if youre looking a softerthanplastic pick this is the one to get
ive been using one of these kysers for a good while now
if i need more ill probably buy this again
great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments
im sure theyll use it often
i looked to make sure it wasnt warped or cracked and it wasnt
personally i prefer the snark tuner but these are a fairly close second
ive been happy with all of gls products so far
just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal
it sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made
the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing
really though its quite good
not as good as say a boss unit but they cost 5x as much
i thought light would be the better route but now im not sure
not a lot to say works great as a shockmount
i dont see this one wearing down anytime soon
there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i dont blame the device
it is easy to hold and is a good product
its still in my primary set up
this was bought based on the advice of others
it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments
it does its job and does it ok for my taste
effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion
just clip it on and swivel the head to face you
all in all a very nice bargain
i have yet to try this through a loop
50 and thicker in case youre looking for very thin ones
to be super critical here is another tip
the athm50s are really solid studio headphones
it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions
so for a player like me these are a godsend
you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop
i got too much background noise with the mike
this is so supple to the touch making playing with it a great experience
i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust
the finish is beautiful and i found no defects
the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far
this is a problem because the sm7bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches
i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions 1
it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up
but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar
but again its way off tune
i play it every day
but it did the two things i wanted it for
the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss
i was origianlly disappointed in the sound
fast forward a few years and i purchase this little baby on a whim
what more do you want
they have never let me down
you wont regret this purchase at all
i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements
ive been using dunlop tortex picks for years with the
one less accessory in the little bag now
i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality
but for around the same price you could get a fender amp
but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer
mostly slinkys or super slinkys
i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires
awesome unit for the price very happy with it
once you start playing you dont notice it though
this is a great set
i didnt notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported
i have no complains about it at this time
it responds really well to my pick attack
a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it
id bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt
works wit all my guitars and for the price it is a steal
when it dies i will buy another one
then i found this for about 100 and i immediately sprung for it
not a bad product acceptable at its price point just didnt impress me much
the screws  anchors are poor
thank you ernie ball for making far superior strings
the models of the vintage fender amps
if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it
secondly the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions
nice works and no problem
this cable works fine im going to buy a pair in january 2013
being toneprint enabled is a 100 plus
i primarily play live and i am a toneoholic
these are great strings worth the money and sound great
pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily
it is a good purchase
the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material
i have used these picks for years now and i just love them
solid and steardy case that will last a very long time
i also tried the bugera v22 all tube amp at the same guitar center
i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal  what a difference
there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector
virtually invisible from the front of the guitar
i had problems getting it to work on my imac
has never failed me yet
anything can be knocked over but this really works better than you might believe
trying out a few new types of picks and different weights
i really like epiphone products
these are made solid and are very stable
best 100 ive spent on gear
i bought two more as presents
these slow me down way to much
i bought a bunch of these when i started building my pedal board
if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
these strings from daddario are a personal favorite of mine
i found it very accurate
i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording
it also folds down pretty well
same with the sm 58es58
i am very happy with this product so far
so i say go for it
i use it on my bass and havent had a problem with it yet
works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options
thats all i can say
they sound great and play easy
mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014
then i happened across these elixir nanowebs
the spherical receiver makes the xm8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands
i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve this
this stand is small but does the job
they are a sturdy but lightweight stand
i have not had that problem with this one so its another plus
i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand
cant beat these 10 stands
at the time i figured all picks were created equal
some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency
it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable
i was surprised at the good quality for such a little price
a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceage sounding
i urge you to purchase if you are looking
i have no recommendations for a volume pedal
they work well on bass and acoustic however
i should of bought this a long time ago
a best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians
so i have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars
easy to use interface and very well constructed
they work just as well as the more expensive ones i have used
my songleaders have tested it and guess what
i still pull one of these out every once in awhile
worth the higher price because of the warranty
there is so much in this little box
id be lost without this tool
no more winding string wraps around the tuning post
this is the first strap that ive bought in a long time
but if you really want to be amazed do an ab comparison
a im very impress with the precition of this tuner
i paid a bit over 12 and it was an amazon prime purchase too
i also have the same quality strings on my baritone ukulele
it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo
super stable and doesnt take up much space
some peope miss the 34quack34 electric guitar type sound from these other types
every part of these cables are quality
this will get you in tune for 11 or less  cant beat it
i also really like the daddario pures
ive been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar
its working great but it does not work in stereo
i really dont see how gibson can make and sell these for 99
they trust their users to read the freaking manual
you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers
if youre using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicely
do be careful when unfolding as pinching of skin would be very easy
this product worked very well for my needs
might even get a blue mic
durability wise ill lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out
recommended if your budget is limited
i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great
this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations
both of them sound like there was no capo on
for the same reason john lennon once owned a 34sized guitar i suppose
frets look good and nut looks good
its a tight fitting case
i will always buy snark tuners
i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap
who couldnt use an extra arm or two when moving equipment
but i set mine up for a few effects i use live
those units have their own tone problems but thats another review
it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on
i now only use metal slides
that prevents a lot of damage
and it will sustain your notes
still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased
the shubb works great on both
when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune
i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action
heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be
put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier
if you are thinking about buying this product do it
this takes the guess work out of tuning your hides
the only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life
firstly let me address the 34adjustable backrest34
but had no idea if this would be as good as all that
if the answer is 34hell yes i deserve them all
this pickup is actually a really great product for what it is
original posting my first mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment
a little story to back these locks integrity
the sound is very big full and nice
i love the sound but i wont use it live in case of feedback
i had 4 mics 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set
it seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it
it works awesomely and its not a bad price for name brand cables
maybe its my naivete in hoping for a perfect instrument
its sturdy well made and cheap
probably one of the reasons its so affordable
and daddario never produces junk
the stand is very easy to set up
i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky
feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise
i installed them on a prs se santana in just a few minutes
sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesnt make cases
the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better
the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are
so for now im good but in a few weeks ill need new strings
a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories
a real money saver in the long run
easy on and off and stays put
i bought this strap for my luna 12 string
it works so great i ordered a few more
works for a cheap bridge on my cheap stratocaster knockoff
maybe ill see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work
a more forward lead guitar sound
these are what i use on a regular basis
so the sample from the vine
the actual wire is under 834 long itself
the are certainly ok and play fine
it does exactly what its supposed to do
but for now does the trick
cant complain about a price like this
interestingly enough i dont leave this pedal on all the time
also it cant be beat for when youre just jamming alone at home
youll never get your arm in there far enough
easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap
so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand
years ago i used the clayton 34small teardrop34 picks
the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy
the sound is a little too electronic for me
im not a switch whole patches on the fly guy
just pure creative sound that wont break the bank
they work just fine for a starter
nothing too spectacular about them
it did take some measuring to get this in place
june 15 2010 update  elixir is a wonderful company
even when at low volume its tones will fill a room
the pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus
these are good dont get me wrong
im having so much fun with it
i buy elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now
im sure other picks works just fine but these are always my preference
these are slightly shorter than other stands i have
mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence
these daddarios do both things and do them well
me not so muchill just leave it hang
i may try those next time on my les paul
i have several of them and use them often on many guitars
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic
the best thing is the price is great
i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy
my old one lasted a long while and it still works
the tuners i have for my guitarbanjo have modes for use as a metronome
the tech at the guitar shop cant see how either
but this will be my go to bluesrock pedal for quite some time
i have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way
i unplugged the usb cable for the microphone and things went back to normal
cant think of a single negative thing about this product
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
this works just as good as anything else
if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case
theres not much to be said about this pedal  it just works
they had a very nice and balanced mids and highs
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
this amp cable is perfect
damn good for a bolt on
as with other dava picks they wear out pretty quickly
it makes my strings last longer
honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing
i still love the pwma230 but i am no fan of its manufacturer
bought this rosin to see how i would like it
the boost combined with the 2 low bass eqs works wonders for low end
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality
but a cheap item you cant use is money thrown away
they are expensive but worth it
i still own at least of each
not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string
its sturdy reliable and to the point
and compares well with other very high quality gear
these sounded different gel picks
ive been using this for roughly a year now and it works fine
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design
what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish
this takes care of that problem for a couple of bags
the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles
i play in small tight places
it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component
this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so i returned it
i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo
they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do
subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with
also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring  and inner
3 great vocal microphones in its own protective case with its own holders
these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well
i am a long time user of the big fender triangular picks
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
then a friend told me hed switched from the thomastiks to these
bit too thick for me
all pieces that were advertised were included
with these flats the sound is gone
this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics
works with my boss ds1 ac adapter too
when it comes to the low end these are lacking
its plastic thats 1 star deduction but in this case very pleased overall
use this on my taylor acousticelectric which does not have a built in tuner
it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space
overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul
i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound
i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar
i only use the clean side or input one
they translate better with the correction curve active
you really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful
behringer products are good for the semipro
but that is okay for practice and rehearsal
a 90 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration
it was an intellitouch that worked if not perfectly then a whole lot better
this mic is quite good for its price
i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings
best price i have found is at amazon
the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it
good quality xlr cable that works 100 fine
a cute little monster thats surprisingly loud and versatile
neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply
the back panel also has a 14 inch jack line out
for stage i like something heavier
its a good amp im happy with it
if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again
it just arrived to day and seems wellbuild
as beginner these strings were not good for me
came in a timely manner what else is there to say
especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable
easy to see when positioned correctly
the behringer 302usb premium 5input mixer is just what the doctor ordered
its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside
i have enjoyed my protec strap
i installed it and it worked
bought stand as a gift for my sons acoustic guitar
this capo works just fine
all the soft clipping is there for every nuance
i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere
its quite the perfect height for when im seated on my stool
exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope
that having been said im pleased with them as a string for guitar practice
the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off
2 thumbs up and 5 stars
granted it doesnt look as nice but it does its job
pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue
all that said i still gota give the item its due
my wife uses on her 6string acoustic and electric guitars
it sounds balanced warm and bright
good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner
i wanted mymxl 2010 multipattern studio micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it
quality good especially given fairly low price
not your fender quality strap
id feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup
overall i think this capos a winner
i paid 110 shipped for mine so look on amazon or ebay for purchase
im enjoying using this pricedright set of strings
ive had one for about 10 years
i am so pleased and excited with my guitar
zero issues with this cable so far
they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks
it said it was brand new
these sell for about 2025 in the real world
this one was cheap and does the job
ive purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months
they even include free picks  which is so cool
overall i like it and i would recommend it
these are very nice looking guitar picks
so why only three stars
update on reviewjan 9 2013
even the bag is nice
im looking forward to learning more about this pedal
you cant go wrong with the ts9
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
never come up short again
ive taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately
forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos
it might even be cheaper
marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts
no more dead 9v batteries
so you just record as quietly as you can
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
this guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was
theres some good bass classical music was clear
i got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas and she loves it
you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better
i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical
it may just have been the one i got though
as far as battery life goes you can get them right on amazon
and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner ive ever used
just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen
but considering the price thats understandable
besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years
if the end leathermaterial is too thick the lock wont fit
i didnt need no adaptation to install it on guitar
does this wok great on a budget absolutely
the footprint is small  meets are needs well
just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product
i highly recommend this tuner
correctly tuned this very old guitar for the first time in years
and yes its still in one piece
its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely
it feels safe and secure
it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar
it kept opening up even without a mic on it
it really doesnt affect play at all so it doesnt matter
this mixer handles it all perfectly
even a kid can use it with a guitar
but for now im impressed
why didnt i think of this
this pedal is an audio swiss army knife
theyre an industry standard for a reason  you dont need 15 dollar strings
i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there
and nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive
its great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar
which you would expect with all the other stuff it comes with
by far the best acoustic strings period
bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well
i thought that more than 25 of the items cost was a bit much
if you dont have these already you better purchase them now
it replaced my roland boss tu12h
the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure
you simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it
i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics
im hooked to bronze strings
nice cord sturdy build good sound
this is a great small gig or practice amp
i can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red
otherwise the size of the dialface the clip itself is precisely the same
will buy more in future
the joyo ultimate overdrive is simply a great pedal
only five watts yes but thats still enough to fill a room
and youre gonna do that right
will order another set soon
or so the historical theory goes
good tuner unlucky with two lemons i guess
i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget
the chorus effect has plenty of adjustment tone and depth
folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag
cord is long enough 6con build quality is slightly less than the fc4
i have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords
this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole
the question was 34did it meet your expectations
comes with a power supply
these are for lead and not rhythm
it is still like new
the picks weight was perfect
this is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings
the construction of this set is superb
the shape and ergonomics are a mix between a kyser and a schubb s1
totally nofrills rock solid metal construction and you cant hear it at all
the tip is a little more rounded
they are what you order
first you guys who complain about the plastic housing
i wanted to wait until i knew a little something before i reviewed it
monster cable is one of the things on earth we can count on
im a procheapo and i hated this thing
both picks have their own unique tonal character
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
is it equivalent to a boss dynacomp visual sound or keeley compressor
good deal on this package of patch cords
the distortion it gives is good
provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volumewah pedal that works great
great strings and they last well
ive had it for about 5 or 6 years now
besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe
i ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons
but oh boy i like it
it has little geckolike protrusions that grip the e string
i guess thats to be expected for a light pick
bottom line  a great toy
great cable for patching in and rocking out
if there is any latency i cant hear it
best strings for my ukulele
sometimes this new one just wont 34hear34 the string being tuned unless its encouraged
powered usb hub in between
i purchased this for my love of playing guitar
i love this little tuner
i have dozens of them they never wear out
the uke tuner here is gloss black and the snark2 is matte red
action is low but does not buzz very easy to chord
hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling
for the money you cant find a better deal
otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding
it is recording my guitar beautifully
you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off
overall im happy with this brand
much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
im on the fence with this product
however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks
for me this pedal was a great way to do that
i am thrilled with the starcaster
mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex
this will help you figure things out
now i can actually get on with the music  another excellent behringer purchase
if youre accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it
if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing dont worry
i have always liked the planet waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy
i originally purchased these strings because of the 1152 gauges
maybe it will get better looking in the long run
i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great
it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website
these are a new style of guitar pick to me
i mean  the range rate arent as broad as others ive tried
if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss
look no further these are great bags
it has higher quality and the dials feel solid
the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic
i bought these primarily because they are so cheap
that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it
i love tascam gear and have used it for nearly 30 years
i really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it
you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time
i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals
this is what the black ice delivers
hate to see how the mediums fit
it fits very well and sounds great
i changed this for a tc electronic polytune
i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument
case  arrived in great condition
is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition
this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first
its worked equally well on my acoustic  my electric
yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends
for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do
i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner
combined with the absolutely deplorable build quality of the clip itself
ive never received a bad stick from amazon
i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use
i started getting nice compliments about the guitar
these are the absolute best picks ive ever used
its a good cloth for polishing no more to say about it
but with a little trial and error i figured it out
well they were a great investment
it was quieter with a much better midrange
if i plug the us100 back in the settings revert again  very reliable
you really should try it yourself to understand
oh and not to forget
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
will purchase an extender to use with it
probably the best capo i have ever had
but then its only fifty bucks
i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise
changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better
but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk
with one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have
and then the less than good
but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less
however i could have got this product for a lot cheaper
it is definitely worth it
heres what it is  an exceedingly wellconstucted amazingly playable guitar
my challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room
it worked out of the box
buy them you wont be sorry
i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional
whats the difference between the 58 and the 48
the quality of the guitar is amazing
but even when its off im getting absolutely no buzz from my effects
many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion
i also like the fact that theres no logo on the outside
the pictures do it no justice
i really really recomend this one
it is a very handy tool
they even had velcro reuseable tape to hold them 2 each
because they feel good against your fingers
it will help you tame this pedal into what you want
it is bigger than i had imaginedits almost the length of an iphone
i use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming
purchased this for my son to use on his guitars
for lt 75 shipped i certainly cant complain
a great investment thatll last quite a long time
so i have to give these three stars overall
absolutely tickled with the look and performance
but these picks are pretty amazing
cant say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad
its a classic strap from fender
and its more than the switches difference which i dont use anyway
i have these on all my guitars and always will
might be some sort of powdercoating as well
we bought this tester for our son to use for his bands equipment setup
mine broke and so did my friends
i would buy this amp again if mine was stolen
i am not disappointed in the least
excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic squire strat series
setup was easy and quick
i went with the mediums
i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks
my guitar is a gibson les paul 2008 standard plus
replace the tremelo arm with the one offered on amazon as well
two pieces easy to set up in seconds
i got this product to see if i could fix the problem
ive never used the metronome feature other than to check it out
it appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument
i currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate
for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install
ive been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone
im a fender fan but this beats their single switch
this little guitar stand works very well
i first used this pedal when my green screemer died
i wanted a strat copy that i could customize  this is it
ive used these elixir strings for years and i would never change
notice in the name guitar input
cheap accurate over mic even better over jack
jc clean black panel brit combo and rfier mean nothing to me
very pleased always have a spare pair in your case
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
the name martin says it all  has for manymany years
i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning
its also a noisy pedal
all their cords are quit and are quality produces
below is thewarning verbatim from amazon
good strings i would recommend them
quality has always been very consistent
this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up
check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp
i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality
the tone of my ovation was back
ive been playing with this a lot since i got it last week
however all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars
i also got black knobs as well
thanks d8217addario for providing an awesome product
our second week and all is well
its well made and not too expensive
bought these for my squire strat
it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc
add in some delay and it will give you an organtype swell
i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string
for the price its amazing
sturdy enough for repeated use
id give this baby six stars if i could
mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar
with those goals in mind i was pleasantly surprised how good the bx5 sounded
i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine
looked at a lot of cases most priced 90 or above
i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner
i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x2 champ
pedals are not budget friendly
id give it 4 stars
but i cant recommend this product
if you buy 34items sold from amazon34 you can depend on free shipping
at the sale price of 119 this cant be beat
it works well so far on all my ukuleles
the construction fabric color and padding are all a1
the pm05 has more boom but less treble
ive always used shure or heil mics that cost over 250
i am currently overseas and didnt want to bring my good guitar along
it is fast enough to use real time during intonation practicetraining on fretless bass
this cable works perfect for its purpose
i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume
this also happened to two of my friends snarks
these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name
guess i am not a gimmick person
input has to be kept within a small range
i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal
ill update after ive had it for awhile
my kid is happy with this strap for his guitar
march 29 2012  just a quick addendum to my initial review
its sounding nicer that way
there was no greaselubricant qualities
they sound more mellow and not as bold
it sounds great it works perfectly and it was 40
it sounds great and i like the headphone and mp3 player hookups
it has good lenght between two plugs
i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering
there is a gain knob
i will buy these again
it holds both electric and acoustics
i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night
hard to beat at that price
the fenderschaller design covers all of these bases well
when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal
tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice
that makes it fairly useless
i just wasnt at the right height
if you want 90 sound reduction however you will need a metal mute
excellent classic rock and lead tones
this box is small but packs a great punch
it is a little heavy but that is something i can get use to
they dont need any string cleaners either
read my review on those though
ill be looking at additional items from this company
we use those widethreaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall
i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on
looks awesome with my white jackson
but heres my issue the distortion is not crunchy
doubt it works at all
if you need some 6 cables to connect your pedals look no farther
the unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument
made of durable nylon with pick pocket
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
regarding the sound it is unbelievable
these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
the battery drains like a mf
this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider
its compact and great to use
geat value for the money
i have a dreadnaught resting on it now ready for use
i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars
if you aint intelligent good luck
the capo was easy to pop out of the package
the picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order
for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal
from experience it never hurts to have extra picks around
i love adding channels to amps and that is exactly what this pedal does
then carefully drilled two holes per tuner
great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness
i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments
a very attractive and well constructed strap
these work well with the telecaster tone and string through design
but you will get over that once you see how long they last
but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it
it is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise
my loyalty is certainly not shaken
for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height
great for lead playing and with small fingers like i have they feel great
im sorry i bought it and i dont recommend this pedal
cons  lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast
i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp
that may sound badm but i am glad because its better than too small
folds up easy so i can tuck it away
there is definitely a lot of clarity here
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy
to conclude would i recommend these
the cordoba is much nicer
good solid connections with no play
of the three the phase 90 has the least versatility
but it sounds great with a tube amp
i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely
when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift
used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them
this is a great place to begin
the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle
this is a great effect
get it if youre on a budget
this stand folds into a pretty small package but supports the guitar very solidly
so check with what you get
just clip it on tap the big button and play a note
anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good heres a few add ons in case
now rocking and basic recording its how its supposse to be
a little background first i guess
this was exactly what i was after
is sturdy and good for price
the title says it all
however i would not change out a working 3way switch for this
and no digging the the parts bin for screws
would recommend these for folks on a budget
i use some threadlock on them
so for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather
if youre doing something similar to me im sure you will be too
i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues
first of all 20 ft is not too long
nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch
anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws
this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps
what else can you say
at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot
the whole unit is heavywood and very durable
i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless
this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost
i get compliments on it
the input signal is cleanly boosted
pick it up and carry it around itll come apart and scratch your stradivarius
definitely the best amp in this
behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals
though be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software
and at the asking price who can resist
can slide and play much smoother with this
for being so cheap this pickup works surprisingly great
very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect
the arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into
also the 34pick pocket34 is only useful when the strap is around your neck
buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it
but eventually i figured it out
well what can i say
i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this
who invented this thing heman
now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy
id not buy another of these for a ukulele
i have used daddario ej16 pb lights for years
that is all the volume i need for practicing in my home
great sound works just like a phaser should
comes with wall anchors but i usually look for a stud to mount on
i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound
another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal
windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver
this thing is simply beautiful
the two violins we ordered came on time and were packaged very well
this cable expands the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v adapter
and ive tried almost every pick there is
dont get me wrong though i still like these
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic
doesnt wotk with vamp 3
id read a lot about the one spot power system
i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range
ill be buying two more
you have to try it to believe it
the bright switch is an added bonus
it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use
this is just the tuner i was looking for
im glad i tried out these daddario strings
the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box
it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order
my fingers just couldnt do it for extended play
they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store
this cup bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water
direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring
i got this and switched over
i believe it has those
its just soso in my estimate but in some cases soso is good enough
highly recommend this for the guitar player
the good  8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time
the tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great
nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends
still looking for the right picks for me
i have found no major issues with any of them
thanks it does what its meant to do
my only complaint about this guitar is that i didnt buy it sooner
cfhevaluation unit provided by manufacturer
based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller
i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal
thats a total of 12
great purchase especially if bought used
with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar
dont let the size fool you
they use it mainly to sing along with their cdsmp3s
based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences
i have not had them very long but seem to do well
so many things i have developed
its a well built solid case for the price
sixth the price is amazing
the 1253mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers
its one of the hest fuzz pedals ever
fits all standard mike stands
they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great
ok so they are just screws
but no hum or noise and seems solid
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
however i think my rating will remain at 3 stars
i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn1
it comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars
and when you are ready to wail just turn up your guitar volume
but for the price its not too bad
assembled the stand in seconds
but for the price this is one hell of a deal
i was surprised of how well this stand is made
this tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly
one worked the other didnt
using this for a prs electric guitar with satisfactory results
i received exactly what i purchased and works as it should
this one is not so stiff and is very well built
i really should get a case
i feel like i am playing with a nickle
i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings
these fit that requirement well
these are slick and seem harder to keep track of
save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar
for the money this is a tremendous pedal
they dont do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do
should last her a very long time
i had always had some issues with it but it was liveable
for that i gave four stars instead of five
so while i got this for my soprano ukulele
compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard
these really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars
daddys never let you down
easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in
i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar
this thing stands up nicely on all three
the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling
for metal its got great control of the distortion tone which sounds pretty good
it sounds very nice especially for the low price
whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear
will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had
id recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a builtin tuner
works well on mandolins too
i got the gold and its goodlooking without being garish
and it would be but the holes are too tight
friend loved it very much
this one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be
the h4n is a great versatile field recorder
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light
they now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar
nothing sounds as bright as these strings
spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks
cutter works great winder makes the job really fast
when it arrived the volume pot was not working
this looper is serious worth every cent i spent on it
and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful
the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way id hoped
after extensive research and listening i decided on the maudio bx5a deluxe
makes the champ a super champ
louder focused and projects much better  almost resonatorlike
no hassle with the right jacks and stuff
wow i am very surprised by this pedal
even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings
the instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps
and shouldnt recording be fun and not frustrating besides
who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place
for the money this strap is as good as any other poly strap
if you hate droping your pick while playingget these
true bypass and no hiss
ive tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass
the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker
still this aint bad for the pocket change they charge
the arm is adjustable and long
i really like this tuner
its easy to install and keeps things simple
you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank
i cannot explain how cool this chair is
i am now a fan of takamine
does what its supposed to do
it does exactly what it says it does
nice and bright so i can clearly see it on stage in the dark
so like most daddario strings
the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport
worked perfectly for that purpose
the first things to upgrade are the pickups
the cons definitely outweigh the pros here
34you know your man is working hard
you get what you pay for
ive had this pedal since the mid90s when i started playing in my teens
ive tried every standard pick  even bone silver  really expensive ones
i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing
these strap pins are fantastic
the first one started working about a week after i bought it
like outlets 182113 outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9v and 12v
no problems works great and doesnt tangle so it stores easily too
ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars
update about 2 years later  i wont do without these
still to me it was money out the window
never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger
i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the lowe tuner
i cannot begin to tell you how much i love this guitar
did i mention this thing is freggin huge
ive had this cable for awhile and im not too impressed with the quality
they play extremely well and last a long time
they were great and incredibly handy
i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area
using this on my ibanez art100 electric guitar
the clips look solid and so far they are solid
the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates
this is the one you want
i havent gotten that far yet
when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it
other then that nothing id change
6 this thing is heavy and rugged
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
built like a tank im pretty sure it will out live me
dont forget to remove it when you guitar is resting
better yet use an ac adapter
its something ive recently been regretting more than ever
these are easy to install using the instructions or without
you can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds
if it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick
its a must have and thats really all there is to say
plush interior hardware looks great and good quality
lots of metal where there needs to be metal
eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should
its soft and rubbery feeling and wont scratch your guitar
the truebypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged
good leather that should last a long time
i have not used the pick holder yet
it doesnt appear to change the sound quality or tone
audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables
on top of all that it looks nice too
this guitar will make a player proud
i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it
they are solid secure and they look great
unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable
the construction is pretty basic
plenty of power as well
yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard
for the price why not
they dont wear down as easily as delrin tortex or some other materials
the adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably
comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly
what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere
some say dawdareeo deahdareeo dadareeoh or deeahdareeoothers shorten it to dadds or even daddyos
i am very pleased with the product
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
this mike is a great way to start recording at home
nice and warm and lush
support cords seem to be of good quality
overall good cloth for general use
i especially like the dual inputs on front
to compare this i tried a g7 capo kaiser and schubb
these mics are very solid and i cant tell them from the real deal
doesnt suck tone cables are sturdy and they sound great
ps  i have the russian variant
cable would be ok if the end connections would stay screwed together
well padded and will not damage your instrument
ends are not too bad and it works for what it is
this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money
this is a high quality microphone
my son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings
if youre thinking aout buying this guitar dont
the playback sound is very good quality
too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever
the strings seem to hold up well
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar
you dont have to be a rocket scientist to use it
it totally deserves 5 stars
it costs 12 bucks great microphone for someone on a tight budget
i purchased this item sometime in august and think its pretty good
i ordered this strap to use with both my concert  tenor ukes
you never know until you try
in short i havent found a better shockmount for condenser mics
finally found the right one
id suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions
it uses a cr2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time
this is much better than the other brand i have
im a beginner and is more than enough for now
would like to purchase another one in the future
also with its size and brightblue color its anything but a stealth machine
im a huge fan of elixirs
my budget must be tripled at least
it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly
changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore
this one says specifically for a ukulele
these cables are very good quality
this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from
this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is
i like these well enough that i have four of them
one day id try all 3 playing along with a cd
so if you do get a bum string give them a holler
but the tone can be a little harsh so i got these
if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though
for a nice strum these are fine
it fits my jasmine es31c dreadnought acousticelectric guitar just fine
they fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads
perfect intonation all the way up to the octave
they last for ever and never cause buzz or noise
replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl
im very pleased with these
ive never owned one before this
again the overall tone is fantastic
three key words for this  accurate  small  inbeat
i simply couldnt get this to work most of the time
none of the problems onoff that plague the cry baby
okay i bought a 1966 telecaster brand new back then
i use these to play slide
in fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set
it sounds so much nicer
i could have used a baggy to hold my picks
i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good
then you have the backpack handles as an option as well
not too long not too short
recommended by eric friedman on a post and im glad i followed the recommendation
they sound great and stay in tune well
from blues to hard rock  metal
these will save you a few minutes
it is very hard to accurately cut the strings
i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila
he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny
if you want to sound like 5 dimebag darrels then dont buy this pedal
sounds good and well worth the money
oh and tight strap button holes
tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard
turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well
will but another one if any of them die great product
buy the focusrite interface or one of the others
the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read
because you like the tone they provide
for one thing theyre pretty stiff
when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion
there should be a complete manual at least in pdf included with the product
the fit is nearly perfect
this makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier
even the case impressed me
this will make your fretboard smile
this little amp does everything i need for small gathering
im only sad they dont make a noise gate or something similar
i dont know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached
it belongs in front of a tube amp period
maybe the maxon made version
id describe the sound as a bit 34metallicish34 definitely a sharper tone
i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight
in which case ill probably go daddario or cobalts
id suggest that this is not for beginners
theyre fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent
i like how it works
i wouldnt recommend these to anyone
he says its easy to use and is durable
plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper
i didnt realize they would hold large tripod stands
would have received a 5star rating had it been in a metal enclosure
i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great
im sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound
cool looking pedal box to boot
overall this is an extremely wellmade tool for your guitar kit
best packaging i have seen and for the price dont order just one pack
nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time
it truly does have true bypass and logical controls
imo you cant go wrong with this tuner very pleased
overall sounds and looks awesome
ive bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts
this is a great little amp especially for the money
they will require that i drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly
of the lot the shure sm7b is my favorite of the ones still available
no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music
the bench is very sturdy and comfortable  the cushioning is thick and soft
one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile
i could not be happier
its expensive for a joyo but cheap for a really good od stomp
i dont know a lot about guitars and strings
it looked great and felt solid
the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over
you might find that youre a convert within seconds
i am not a slap style player so i cant comment on that
what this produces is smooth oldstyle overdrive
this is a well built and high quality product
its very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without
even the light picks are thicker than the 34thin34 picks i had ordered before
we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices
this is the most ive ever spent on a guitar strap
they appear to hold up well under constant moving
60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups
use with power supply and not batteries
when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldnt be hype
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing
this would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument
this is a great effect
it works as it should and does well
there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob
great quality and i would definitely buy them again
recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly
i dont play enough to need changes that often anymore
but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the deans
so i thought it would bea good opportunity to try a 34nonstandard34 strap
bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design
self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp a real nice feature
one star only for this product
the wire cutters also work really well
they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them
worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed
just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced
impressively clear recordings unlike any ive been able to obtain using aplantronics
this is much easier and the guitar sounds great
it provides at extra layer to reduce the ps fs ts etc
i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed
needed this cable to hook up my dean evo to a practice amp
the heil pr40 is pretty good but doesnt have any onboard eq options
after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic
i have a vox ac30hw2x and i put this jj 12ax7 into v1
i sincerely like the concept
the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder
i prefer gold or silver rings at the end
do not let the size of this little amp fool you
the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence
i typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars
also play the the concert scale banjolele
it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it
works like its supposed to
009s might be intimidated by
terrific strings for the price of cheapies
this thing has phantom power just in case you didnt read that already
i would get this stand again
thanks for such a dependable product hosa
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product
it does its job reliably and well
i wasnt totally blown away either
these tuners just seem ok to me
i have two of them
it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug
my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close
they attach to the wall with 2 screws
hangs my guitar around my neck so i dont have to hold it there
i may buy another set soon and restring the shortscale instrument with lights
this is a close second to the g7th
but the width makes it feel better till its 34brokenin34
also certain notes sustain while others seem to die out too early
to my ear it sounds good but you never know
so i like to play with thin gauge picks
these are the best strings you can buy imho
this particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar
it can holds all the my guitars with no issues
from here you can get any type of compression you want or need
the shape is cool but id feel safer with it in a metal casing
this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for
the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool
finally i gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely
good quality for my casual use
the reviewers werent lying except that one guy who gave it a 2
only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer
the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better
i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something
it plays very loud and clear zero buzzing
5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer
nice airlinesized bottle w safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening
like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa
the other effects are icing on the cake
does it get the job done
not as bright as i would like them however very nice
strap is quite stiff but id say its worth the price
for this price i cant see why anyone would not like this pedal
i rate it five out of five stars
definitely worth the reasonable cost
i feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient
locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar
my music program had no problem detecting it and using it
is it as good as the shure
what more could you want
ive been using the daddario strings for about 10 years now
a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass
i like it and it is small
in addition the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob
excellent bass response not muddy at all tight mids and clear highs
this stand is very stable and easy to put together
just got this stand today
this guitar tuner is such a great and useful tool
my only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for amazon prime
i have them all and they all work great
used this for more than a year and finally sold it
the eq effect just kills the pedal for me
i am not a fussy person about guitar strings
and the pick holder is a nice touch but
sure the od is there but it isnt worth losing your tone is it
and they were right about that
i have the red  blinking light syndrome also
good buy for the price
theyre gorgeous sounding especially when new
i highly recommend digi stuff
snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great
i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical
cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft
im pretty fond of this little guy
nylon has incredible strength but isnt very comfortable
this will work for just about everyone
i replaced a bone noncompensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this
really cant go wrong with the ditto
its yellow its metal its boss
dont go onto the stage without one on these boxes
this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look
this strap is very nice and comfortable
not on my newer sg thoughat least with the new screws it comes with
it makes placement a snap
it fits well close well protects well transport well
i play guitar bass and violin
i do not own that pedal so i can not fairly make a comparison
just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out
never say no to free stuff
it goes with us when we travel with our guitars
the anchors stayed in the wall
its just a little bit short for my taste
it was also just noisy in the pedal chain
i have many planet waves cables
it just sounds more organic and less sterile than the boss pedal
i get everything on amazon now
he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more
its worth spending a jackson imo
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback
recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money
i love the dunlop formula 65 polish and cleaner
havent tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too
its a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part
best recorder for the money ive seen
other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this
bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price
a perfect match for the original i replaced
they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly
accidental turnon in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem
good price and it arrived quickly as well
next week ill purchase another with a different feature
good product after you get it assembled
if u have hand problems  try these
this is a great little tuner
not good for palm muting
not sure which they have
what the hell is the plural of lexus
allsteel frame construction feels sturdy
bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am redoing
for a soft bag this offers all i would ever need
i employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortionsoverdrives
this is a good product
it is comfortable around my neck and shoulder
there are ways to improve the offtheshelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately
i would imagine it weighs about 1014lbs
our son has four or more of them too
excellent price and product is as described and price was right
these strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings
that happens far less now
for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so
i sprayed it in my bass guitars pot and now its like new
the sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get
i looked at all the wires inside and they look ok
locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open
also this model is xlr only
nearly all do but some companies like blue snowball snowflake etc
its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength
thats why i dont use them anymore
spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat
not from music123 it doesnt
these strings are different and really quite nice
this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it
this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables
this is good for the money
its a good quality strap and i have three of them
but roundwounds just didnt feel or sound right on a fretless
this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musicians gear stand
if was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood
easy on my fingers too
i like the tones i get from these and the price is very good
the tuning is excellent and so easy
according to the ad copy this pedal replicates fullstack marshall crunch
a third button for reverb would have been amazing
im not kidding  it was one of those finds
if you dont mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap
the foam is good and the hardware is included
this one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorry
great pedal and it is still built like a tank
i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay
the digitech bad monkey is one such example
the tails tend to have a little unnatural decay or something
soooo its pretty much useless to me
im used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck
these are solid stands for holding your guitars
i like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around
money very well spent and highly recommended
it sounds like a cheap mic
i bought 2 of these about 6 months ago
it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd
not much to say here
if youre purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands
but it works fine for me
the trigger is a rocker switch
that is my only complaint
have used it on a couple of ukuleles
i replaced everything with those
its a 20 amp it does what it has to and does it well
now off to buy some different bridge materials
purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo
i recommend this mic for vocals
also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps
my larrivee rs4 came with these and converted me to schaller
if it didnt have this fizz i would give it a 5 star rating
i ordered this for my husband the musician
if you want a good all around microphone this is not it
first the natural finish is what got me started
its not loaded with gimmicksjust the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed
it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range
using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal
the joyo allows you to make this change easily
leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes
it also has a worththepricealone space feature
i ordered this hard case for my fender t bucket
he hasnt had any problem with the capo yet
tc just does things right
martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow daddario just shines
you can get them for less than 3 per pack if you shop around
im glad i did  what a nice guitar it turned out to be
im running 365vdc on the plates and 340vdc on the screens
works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course
t is  axlr to ubs cable
it doesnt sound exactly like a vox  but i dont gig
i used them with my harbinger ha60 pa system and i was not disappointed
some people say they are too slick
however i had problems at first until i made some changes
it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate
it really has its own thing going on
the price cant be beat and will give your guitar that 70s look
switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull
it came as well packed as a brandnew guitar and looks like one
they are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them
i used an 1164 drill bit for the pilot holes
so whats up with the 12 volt adapter spec behringer
no big deal at all
nice and bright easy to see
but all in all i will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort
highly recommand this for anyone needs pick
i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy
i can say its built much better than i thought it would be
nice gold tips and polished finish for great connectivity
id definitely buy more cables of this brand
also got the tuning pegs
i should have bought another one of these instead
unbeatable for acoustic especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy
they bend too easily making rhythm playing impossible
but if you like to go deep youll love the fender fuse software
these should last a lifetime barring any physical damage
works very smoothly and doesnt eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners
i have many heavy guitars
glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin
no problem as i bought one as a spare against emergency breakage
i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good
its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for
so easy to tune with it
it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg
i change strings quite often so it really doesnt matter
not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing
if youre looking at them then get them
one other advantage these picks have is that they never break
they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter
i bought a ukulele  to give as a present
i just learned last night how to coil them up
is it a monster cable
i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick
order it now while the price is this low
i played it finger style and strummed with a pick
they hurt my ears so clean
the switch is easy to use
we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it
it doesnt have a strap button at the top end
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound
great customer service and love the pics
the unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature which i leave on
its durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
there is no doubt about it national fingerpicks are pretty much the standard
i use it in front of my shure beta 58a and its absolutely perfect
the guitar came in great shape
for practice and the home studio it is great
but the quality of these cables can vary greatly
seriously for the price these cant be beat
im running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out
i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers
the top is natural cedar
i think its time to sell them off
i cant believe this mic is that good
so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics
this is a great pedal for price
these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles
i have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here
they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha
i also like the capo tuning feature
great recorder on so many levels
great price for a simple strap at around 5
it is not cheap but it is well made and useful
ive been playing for 40 years
the rest is just great
bottom line for gigging probably go with the 100s
i wish i could find a guitar bag that was this nice
for the price i got a little more than expected
put this through an ac30c2 and prepare to be amazed
in order to be used effectively the tuning space must be relatively quiet
i have a mim 2012 strat every thing went together with out any issues
works great so far and dont regret purchasing
i only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding
anyway the attack on this pick is so just
the tone knob does nothing
i always seem to have to retune with the spring loaded capos
anyway through the gcs3 the fullbore basically sounds like a mesaboogie
excellent product though the metronome is of no value but thats not important
the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic
snark solves all of these problems
its easy to set up and easy to take down
super tight and very accurate
i sat down plugged it in and played a bit
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
really nice looking and heavy duty
not that a guitar should ever be considered clutter
it is very robust versatile good looking and not very expensive
i just feed the shoulder strap through the carryhandle and it works well enough
i like snarks and think they are some of the best clipon tuners
easy to put togetherstable and cheap
i like the sound of this pedal
if you play rhythm dont bother
how can you beat that
five stars without a doubt
but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable
well i didnt expect much due to the price
most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external powerpedals
to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise
plug it in via usb and you literally on your way
violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem
it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear
has some nice rubber on the bottom
the color is spot on with the pictures shown
i really like this pop filter
im changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star
for 4000 you cant go wrong with this one
very comfortable in the hand
if you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand guaranteed
i have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them
easy to install on the guitar
6 stars if they had it that high
however i did encounter one strange thing
this manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars
then id try a different set every 3 days
they engage and disengage without binding or looseness
might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad
after shielding it is absolutely quiet
this is the wah i was looking for
i played it all but 2 weeks until i got bored and stopped
ive watched friends  bandmates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps
easy to use and quality built
fits straps locks just fine
daddario prelude violin string set 44 scale medium tension is good deal for beginners
it does not break and is very sturdy
and despite its very low price its very solidly built
this is good but it takes some getting used to
when i tried it at the shop it sounded great
it has a metronome which can be fun
great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp
you cant go wrong with the bright blue led either
i buy one of these for each guitar
its supposed to be 7 lbs
the max grips have a much better grip
but if you demand metal get far away
on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits
the price is great and it works
when i told them the price they thought i was pulling there leg
get a few rolls as a meter doesnt go as far as youd think
its all about money to them
there is such a thing as too much
this ampwas a wonderful deal at 300 when i originally bought it in 2011
these are the best celluloid shellcolored thin picks around
simply plug it in and find the right drivers
it holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed
connection is secure no worries about uneven connections it also detaches without a hitch
and i love the sound of these strings
you turn on the echo pedal
none broken yet but i dont usually break strings
sound on the other hand
it is not the best but the sound is superior
the sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next
i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag
so i dont see how you can go wrong
i bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from hercules
it is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online
i will be buying these again
its a very fair price and is made well
was more than i expected for the price
haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks
thats not where elixirs kill the competition though
the testers are very cheap and may show problems you werent aware of
this device has really help me
materials and labor all look good to great
plenty for classic rock and blues
i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms50g
i had to have more like an addiction
besides who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works
i dont hold it against the pedal though
they work flawlessley and tune is amazing
also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak
delivery packaging etc were very good
i ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised
the dr600 was my first behringer pedal
i have never had a hosa go bad on me
amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too
the behringers go for 15000 while the mackies go for about 25000
ideal for gigs as well as studio and home
it sounds good enough that i dont mind the lack of true bypass
i would still recommend it though
great for instruments and vocals as well
they seem to work well so far
now i have a lot more guitar for my money
the thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression i played
this is usually a little more than i require when jamming
i have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work
there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport
its perfect for vocals podcasting video recording and so forth
the master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular
i love the price and they last me quite a while
perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest
this is the most awesome loop pedal ever
i got a superb machine for the money
any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use
it could be from shipping
the quality of these guides is not what i expected
features  stable base good extension easy hand grip to lockunlock for adjusting
the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry
no buildup or residue on your fingers either
what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings
i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill
the price is a great selling point just by itself
well made like a tank
looks good but disappointed that they arent made in the usa
wanted one again so found this one and bought it
i sing fairly low and airy  works great for me
the first one worked great and so does this one
if you want to understand any theory start here after learning basic chords
it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet
i have them for my guitars and for my mics
believe it or not ive been putting off buying one
however a standard 2 driver is too big to fit into the strapbuttons
time will tell if they last longer than strings 13rd the price
for 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar
never really had to mess much with this item
works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well
you could drive nails with this thingno exaggeration
for my homestudio purpose i like the warmer sound of the pm05 more
the unit uses three aa batteries
someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than i did
it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty
this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric
im a little surprised at this one
is it worth the money
e removes the pops from vocal recordings
it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether
a small device that doesnt color input sound and doesnt get in the way
but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one
i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio
i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well
how do you get that much noise out of an 834 speaker
this is a great stand
you wont go wrong with this capo
it does the job is comfortable and the price is right
this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro
doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo
it does however clip into the sound hole okay
if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again
all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark
i measured this mike at 103 ounces
use for both reference with a gnx4 and guitar and easy listening
but they will not screw down all the way and are losse
good quality wired correctly cant complain
nice clear tones with this pick tips
it arrived earlier than i expected
but that is only a personal opinion
this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hardearned callouses soft
wow is all i can really say
it is ok definitely not great
thats a good thing for the most part
i bought these for my music class
you can definetely trust them to do their job
the whole thing has a good weight
your uke is going to come with crappy strings change them to aquilas
i highly recommend this tuner
theyre shiny and screwed well into the holes
it does it all and is tougher than nails
this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon
i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box
it is simple practical and cheap
simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime
i use harmonica holders for kazoos
top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable
you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time
a guitar player can never have enough of these things around
but this case fits my dot like a glove
i like these little guys
i do recommend some snap locks for it though
this should improve my sustain and tone even more
i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support
i have a martin hd28 with the large grover tuners
this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver
they have a brassy sound to them
i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb
there is no onoff switch this really pissed me off
tunes all my instruments fast and easy
definitely recommend these if youre sick of picks slipping out of your hands
it filled a hole that was missing
its heft heavy and feels well made
i bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap
i do wish it could rotate both directions
okay  color coding is a great idea
they caused me to go out and buy another amp
they dont feel as secure as the schaller locks
i first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks
this is a great stand for your violin or viola
it turned my partscaster into a blues making machine
i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar
they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent
i like the sound quality i get
bought this cover to go with behringer mic
convenient storage is its biggest plus
the bench is also larger than my others
a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made
so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something
i didnt expect them to  but a guy can dream cant he
this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly
i couldnt be happier with this pedal
the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir
so it costs less because we dont need to use it as much
the mc401 on the other hand doesnt color your tone at all
got this short cord to go from amp to waa
i am six feet tall
this is perfect for our digital piano
and manipulate the external controls as needed
unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle
i have it as the last on my pedalboard before my gnx4
nice sturdy and portable case
i will update if that matters in the long run
works well with my marshallhas a lot of feautures and is very versitale
this is the only type of stand i prefer to use
i just picked up a pod hd500 and i love it
also compact and very durable
baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names
i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg
i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player
its incredibly easy to use and very handy when restringing a guitar
sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that fatal blow
fx loop only works with an effect bank
i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag
its 2 what did you expect kevlar
i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo
if i dont change anything most of the time it works ok
it was nice to get these through vine and try them out
monster knows it all in quality
great value and a great tool
if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get
so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks
it gets in the way and is hard to stay stretched out
im pretty happy with this one right now
ive been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010
the case is plastic foam and clips
no more feedback or waking up the next room
you need to view it head on
some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons
strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in
i did not notice any additional string wear or damage
im sure it wont wear out any time soon either
dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument
thanks for the very thorough review mike
best part this strap gets long long long
that said i lovebehringer products that i own
these picks are sturdy and wont break that easily
they have an industry standard packaging
it is a bit like discussing our likes in food musicians movies
stock this tuner was awful
hosa makes some other products that have good value
overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother
my only complaint with this device is the battery connector
i guess if anything thats been the downside to this purchase
both are going to be used for years
i ordered two of these stands and they work very well
10 mm is the perfect thickness
also since a purchased a 3 pack
played as well after the change as it did before
i like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic
using speakon cables mono to each speaker to speaker for easy mixing
only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately
easily fits in my ukulele case too
it looks good as while
the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiplesized tuners
schallers click in and you know they are ready to go
its a quick release with the buckle
after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was
very good rosin and does exactly what is described
the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun
its exactly what you would expect from behringer it works
now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there
it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor
this capo is solid and well made
i sprayed on all my guitars
i didnt realise how much noise my one spot was adding
these are the same strings i paid much more for in my store
as you can imagine i need to practice a lot
are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication
they are made in  the usa and they use recycled packaging
so i am convinced that they work now
i upgraded and would absolutely do it again
this little snark is easy to carry around and works great
the cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument
this is our second one as we both have guitars
i have a yamaha f335bl and a hohner hc06
okay my pros and cons
a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin
this stand is useful for small instruments
042or save some money and go withdaddario exl120 electric guitar strings super light 942
basically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound
my main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate
i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises
this case will fit the 335 dot casino sheraton and the gibson es335
easy to mount rack components
five for tone highmidlow and five for gain
did i mention this sucker is big
you will always get quality from vic firth
this little amp really impressed me
the screen could be a little brighter
they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
as long as i played loudly everything worked quite well
i own the black silver gold and camo kyser capos
just give it a little thought
not much of that complaint here
last but not least  they are bad for frets
only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all its tubes and thinking
youll be happier trust me
simple and useful rack stand
this is the godzilla of volume pedals
padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion
very much worth the cost and i thank amazon for having them
great quality in it also
before i bought this i had to use a tuner on my laptop
lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action
yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like seagulls
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks
fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare
i go with the rat
ive tried the fishman ft1 and the tune tech ttm201
i have absolutely no gripes with elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings
can set different pitch than a4404
no pickguard and it doesnt need one
it can be a little daunting for a newbie
works great on my 100 watt amp
slap and tap an dont forget ur strap
elixer definitely still has the edge
i cant speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome
limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me
looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst
even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return
oh that reminds me the casing is plastic
not perfect but not expensive
many people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone
overall i would buy again
once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results
i have tried the intel krog boss etc
exceeded my expectations on quality and price
sound is about what you would expect
if it works properly and it does what more can you say
i recommend if you need a winder just buy this
i wasnt expecting pro level gear for a sub 100 pedal
my initial impression was somewhat mixed
90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast
its warm and the modulation sounds great
i bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year
i consider it cheap insurance
the looper is really why i bought this pedal
this guitar sounds good feels good looks very good
which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment
the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 775 x 65 approx
i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one
theyre cheap and they work fine
the resttray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments
this joyo jf03 crunch distortion pedal is just amazing
the overdrive has a level tone and overdrive
padded to protect guitar neck
easily stretched and tuned with no problems
you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model
ill be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s
this made me take a second look at schaller
these cans were decent back when they were just above 100 bucks
great price on a highquality polishing cloth
i have room for one maybe two more
will buy again with other size
thought the guitar is beautiful ive had it for a while
kinda makes you aware of what you are playing
but atleast for me it does the job and does it well
attaches firmly and does the job
this amp does almost too much for the money
it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well
if you are a bass player just buy it
these are probably the most wellknown pads available and probably the best
what more can you ask for
im only nitpicking so that you will know all the tradeoffs
one out of 7 arrived doa and another has failed since
i have used the kyser spelling
it leads me to playing for longer periods
i took the plunge and ordered one
the nanoweb coating is nice
perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily
simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just
unless youre so amazing you can make it work every song
i actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations
this is one awesome guitar
put the dough into the guitar not the strap
i tested it with other tuners and its right on
if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues
like these better then the bulkier dunlops
says its easier to use than the smaller cloths weve gotten before
the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static
i bought this 12 pack and they
once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery
i like that feature alot
way too small maybe like a third of the width
perhaps i wind up choosing this but so far eh
2 its very sturdyan oftennoted feature of boss pedals
then choose comfortable straps that wont scratch your guitar like this one
i am going to replace all my old screws with these
all my electric guitars are equipped with these
i like the sound of this amp
i just dont care for them
i bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room
they make another version which is less pointy
im used to conventional steel finger picks
there was some slight noticeable differences
maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit
well i just got started playing guitar and needed a tuner
the use of the device was moderately difficult
the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect
compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well
the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce
the switches are rock solid
over the strings it would slide below the nut which isnt good
they rock and i feel they are the best strings around today period
it looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand
fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar
the primary difficulty was in the how the users manual was written
they can be switched back and forth even while youre sustaining a note
remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor
if youre shopping for a tuner give this a try
plus ill get another one in a different color
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside
digital delays were clear sounding but
i have used a few different capos this is far and away my favorite
what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led
the color advertised was not the one i received
this was something i had to pick up simply due to the price
best price online and the shipping was super fast
the pics and description dont show just how insanely large this is
this product works as advertised but you should beware
responds fast display is incredible
its even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks
great price for good mike
this is a great microphone for 10 bucks did i just say 10
the ac3 is not a set it and forget it pedal
i couldnt understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldnt work
there is nothing worse than a bunch of outoftune loud guitar players
it will probably last 2 life times
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks
shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner
great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great
it is just as describedi am happy
the click effects wear out sooner
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item
or just buy a better guitar to begin with
its a classic rock pedal that screams
i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value
these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not
i wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals
still its a typical snark
excellent product it is well cushioned
i didnt know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps
will try other brands next time
the title says it all
i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable
sure but not for this price
we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people
a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing
these tuning machines are great
but i like it because its cheap light and it works
it is a range of literally hundreds  perhaps even thousands of specific tones
they perform quietly and give a more mellow tone
this pedal wont be leaving my board probably ever
quality at the right price
mine opens and closes ok and the lock works
too large or stiff and you will not get the sound
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2
this with my behringer xm8500 is perfect
all sound really good and completely adjustable
i purchased these to use with my mandolin
arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice
i figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment
other than that it seems to work well
bottom line it extends the life of my strings and thats always good
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however
only thing that was slightly upsetting is that i only received one screw
i purchased this before i have ever changed a string
six out of five stars
do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6 pop filter
i bought an ibanez concert size uke
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent
sounds clear and crystal good unplugged
glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars
that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all
can easily set it up for live situations
i like the picks a lot
i put these 150s on all of my strats regardless of the brand
the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use
this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely
honestly this looks really sharp put together
the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work
they arent that expensive especially as an addon and theyre relly cool
it was my backup amp for a qsc gx5
this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives
that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
this is an awesome analog echo effect
i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals
got the danelectro wall wart for it
after applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable
very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff
i was impressed by the quality of this product
pocketsized headphone amps and so on
the colors punch out nice and will1
the display is large and bright
horrible horrible drivers that never get fixed
ive owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards
it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville 410fender mustang floorboard combination
i think its the way they trail off
i use this all the time
i go through these quite a bot but for 2030 you cant go wrong
easily installed on my parlor guitar
i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely
this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well
the metal fingerpicks are rock solid sturdygauge steel
before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches
would buy again if given the circumstance
you can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it
really these things are great
for the price i dont think i could have done better
they are on the small side
a bit too thick for me
and the ultimate drive does it nicely
i highly recommend this quality xlr cable
i recommend this to everyone a lot of product for an affordable price
it seems extremely rugged again like boss pedals
05034 found on gibons and espltds
thanks amazon for this product sale
tortex picks are the best
upgrade it to something better
should last a few months at least
but within 10 minutes of using it itll stick with you much better
look the product may be good or not
it only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying
yes if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine
i just loaded the whole prerecorded track into a slot
but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a 341 spot34 brand plug
i decided to return it
im normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever
here are the reasons  solidly made everything is high quality
i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster
tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly
convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck
i have a small recording setup and play guitar and bass with friends
a little nicer than i thought it would be
definitely will buy mogami from now on
drs last three times as long as daddario
for the price this lil guy does the job
as a home tuner or for a brightlylit gig  excellent
if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me
nice cushion on both sides  onstring and the back of the arm
the weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock
elixer definitely still has the edge
i bought it to keep my fender strat in and it works great
but in no way matters
mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival
i compared this to a vox valve modeling amp not even a contest
its built to last and solid as a rock
sturdy and a bit weighty
this is now a boat anchor
and i even predrill it
there is no added hiss hum or distortion
como solo boss lo sabe hacer
i guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection
well it fits but just barely
i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there
im using this footswitch to control a drum machine
very pleased with this purchase
it shipped on time and the packing was good
10s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup
this model is not usb
the case is kick ass too easily a 50 value
i can definitely see this being heavy roadgig worthy
my hats off to joyo
i used it a few times
and even play your mp3 player while you play and sing
its perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up
it is built solidly and looks roadworthy
both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head
my suggestion  new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation
really should be 1434 mono or stereo
for a modest rig or on the road use i recommend this product
it wont do long delays
not too much but at least something
i find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars im currently playing
if you fingerpick this is your amp
this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open
i received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar
5 stars for price quality features amazon
i was short a shock mount for one of my cad condensers
its light and easy to handle
i got 2 of these for my electric guitars
this is just what the doctor ordered
thats a win for the customer because it decreases the price
it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold
will buy another if it ever wears out
if i buy more in the future i will be checking here first
that is some stiff cardboard
no but sounds pretty damn good
i can just quick release it when im done
but for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered and is an excellent product
my first thought was now i have to learn how to play this thing
its a great little unit
i rehearse often with this thing
the sound is clear and crisp for its size
so far so good with this pedal
these picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms
its not meant for metal
doesnt cut into your body at any point
the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesnt move at all
sometime round 1994 my friend kendal built several of these for our band
oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard
you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly
the curly cable has fared much better
looks good on my yamaha acoustic guitar
i try others but always come back to them
it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever
the package includes a black nylon gig bag
im a really happy customer now
this is a very accurate tuner
this takes a second to get use to
a real workhorse for sure
the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy
i paid 10 dollars for this
i use mine  daily and it hasnt failed me yet
luckily that was no mere marketing jive
great classic rock 70s tone
if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it
i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele
i think you will like this board
but when i turn pro ill get something better
a lil glue will fix it just havent had time
the m68 gives the jimi a good run
frankly id forgotten how musical this pedal is
there are a few strange nuances though
dont waste your money on this junk
i highly recommend this product
the light should go out
a simple device yet so useful
once i get around to playing with it i will write another review
schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap
i dont notice any difference in audio or loss in sound
fast to take on and off of your guitar
in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful
i think its a wonderful and adequate musthave for any musician
all i can say is wow
this is a great tuner if you know what you are using it for
bends and slides are smoother than ever
these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are
price is right for sure
not enough of a hassle to send it back but worth mentioning
it also makes you looks professional
not the fingers but the hand and wrists so
i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained
i couldnt even get the software to load on my 2013 imac
the mic does exactly what i wanted it to do
just well made and functional
my seagull now sound mellow with brightness
maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit
thats a winwin in my book
however all you really need are the two functions and they work
and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
it looks high quality and has the white ends
for price and quality these are top notch
they seem more durable than other brands
its like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends
i cant get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe
the foam fits nicely around your ears conforming to the contours of your face
i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days
its a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it
combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner
i dont like a pick that is to stiff and i like the grip
hey  stop reading this and order it
so for a good price you get a filter that works
i have had several mxr pedals through the years
my studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs
problem is i get nothing done because i cant put it down
theres no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing
im not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby
this is true but isnt a complete description
a lot of songs say capo preferred
i like the length too
but the instructions say it should be fine
using it as my gain along with the joyo vintage od for lead boosts
this single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects
it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus
this guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well
all in all a great capo that is well made and will last forever
it is easy to use
im only sorry i preordered only two sets at 1249
im using it totally stock and its been great
the price was very good
up to this point i havent been very impressed by solidstate technology
i use it on my guitars and my banjo
the flex is just right for me and they last forever
good for my small space though
it also is easy to store when finished
but back to the tuners
occasionally i get a small pop when i engage it but not that frequently
this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice
i had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom
they havent changed much dont fix it if its not broken
inbetween the lights and mediums
which brings me to another minor complaint  no linux drivers included
the sound guy thought it was an sm 58
anyhow i digress but for a reason
us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
a friend plugged it into his marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous
and if it doesnt so what
you must have one of these
i own several of these and love them
this thing was over a hundred dollars
soon i will be in the market for an upgrade
these nyxls from daddario are definitely in that notch above category
if its 30 wait a few days and see if it goes down
the pitch black is nice and bold and bright
out of the box i was amazed at just about everything
this is a nice leather mandolin strap
ive played this pedal for a while now and really dig it
if you need an overall great set of strings get these
do not let the size fool you
the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets
the mic looks good but has almost no mass
not cheap  but worth every cent
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
ive always used ernie ball strings
these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on
i have two of them
i bought these when i had to retube my marshall jcm800 2203kk head
so this one works well for the price
three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself
ive had no problem with this guitar stand
for the functionality alone its definitely worth asking price
having the pick pocket is a neat feature
042 on the low e which is just too small for good twangy bass
the distance between the plugs is sometimes too short
it works well for all of them and is inexpensive
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
the mount has exceeded my expectations
the quality is great price is right and delivered on time
i havent used the cable yet but it looks new and durable
if its not the highest quality stop complaining
they work well but they are not mogami
regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book
ive always used the competition
individual volumes controls make it perfect
speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces
ive had them on for a couple of weeks now playing fairly regularly
i liked the big boss tu1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations
the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless
they are used by other artists that approve of them
looks better than the expansive one my grandson has
the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily
its not stamped to be one so thats why im confused
yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right
unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem
i like the pick pocket too
i would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar
a less important issue has to do with the grain
in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input
it does exactly what i needed it for
i would recommend this to anyone
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder
its large and takes up space on my pedal board
the cable clips are a nice touch
nice soft flexible leather and very adjustable
quality and value so you cant go wrong
for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build
the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks
i cant wait for us to do some mother and daughter electric guitar duets
definitely not a flimsy stand
its very cool that it has 5w 1w and
and it arrived a day early
i had to send it back for a refund
fits perfectly in sound hole
more knobs are not always better
only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer
super simple to install and very sturdy once installed
youll still have a nice cord you can use on any mic
comes with the screws and the 34cotton34 washers so you dont scratch the body
i was worried that the plastic clips wouldnt hold up but they do
that may have damaged a contact
it feels like you get a boost in your midrange
they wear out extremely fast though
the 90s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
the bass sounds more like a real bass
still it works and was inexpensive
this is easy to remove
they work well just need to be a little bigger
easily worth the extra dollar
as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound
if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by bossroland
cons wish i had this 20 years ago
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
but then i read how you use it and all that
works great and you cant beat the price
i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also
im using this in v1 in a 5 watt tube amp
it is easy to use with one hand and does the job
that said youll probably do ok
by the way these are listed as
i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes
dont like that its difficult to change the tube
then again i never mistreat my equipment
so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented
sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings
i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch
i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was misswired
the snark unlike the korg tunes by vibration
not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge
plugged it in worked first time no problems
i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles
just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage
capo is well made and is very well priced
they work very well on the floor
i absolutely love it and im glad that the aluminum ones are durable
adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone
the strings themselves are the normal color for strings
i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it
stays in place and cannot slip out
the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet
perfect for my home studio holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard
where is this pedal now in my collection
for most of us this is more than adequate
best quality than polytune  1 lighter and best switch
very light so i leave it on when i play
this is a nice microphone stand
ive been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great
there is an oring to seal the top portion of the threads
these strings are the bomb
tuned them once no breaking in
should last a while with good care
perfect for old van halen solos like in 34you really got me
i going to see if i can return them for store credit
this works much better in that regard
i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar
comes in a really nice case
however when it comes to tubebased pedals big is par for the course
the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs
several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck
bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings
provides everything i need from a mic stand
however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it
i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same
its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way
this runs from my guitar to the pedal
be sure to check is the length of the arm is ok
its simple portable and sturdy
but thats been my overall experience with digitech stuff for a long time
colors help keep track of what is going into where
if you havent changed your saddle
after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew
one less thing to tote
i am extremely pleased with this amp
this little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate
is a nice cablegod quality  as always with the fender brand
rapidlyfirmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet
real good variation from full out rat like to not so much saturation
and in general im pretty satisfied with it
what do you expect for two dollars
one of my favorite strings for my les paul
he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand
but compared to a buddys roland and solid state ampeg its downright mellow
you can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq
they ring like they should
accurate and quick  great for between song quick tuning
in summary its ready to be used right out of the box
the materials feel high quality
if you try playing clean with no distortion youll be underpowered
the quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear
the only options are the drywall anchors
a near miss with the ns
this is still usable but it is for very big fingers
the display is easy to read
sounds like a million bucks
did i mentioned great value
first of all its huge
i will buy another one of this
this pedal was priced very well 32 and had nearly a 5 star rating
solid yes adjusts to right height  yesit is perfect
for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesnt advertise
this one does it all
great for the knock around uke though
spend a few more bucks and get a padded one
i hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
while i wish the bases came in different colors i really like these hangars
so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand
sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me
cool speaker and nice addition
tends to slip on the strings however
not much else you can say about it
i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement
ive used it a few times but dont see the benefit
but its well built and would make a decent od
as for the sound  the pedal sounds great
just use a cloth or paper towel
the metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program
this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratchproof stance
and i like the mother of pearl yahama inlay on the headstock
its a tipnegative polarity and the privia requires a tippositive polarity
i stuck some repurposed rubber feet on the bottom
other musicians were impressed by it as well
this is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing
if i need another stand i will buy this one again with no hesitation
it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely
the only negatives ive found are 1
its a good quality case
perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle colored
first behringer pedal i have returned
i dont really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a 34ukulele34 setting
however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems
strung these up on my lp goldtop with p90s
also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock
excellent sound quality and i would pin them against bose any day
but i am sure other people may disagree
i have used it on microphone electronics to shield out rf noise
cons  transformer on cord and antenna on remote
a lot of bands i have seen on the road use these straps
this makes it very convenient but also a bit touchy
if so have a few of these on hand and replace that nut
bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied
between these blues and the yellow im covered
enough grip to stay put in hands well too
eventually i ended up uninstalling it
this particular unit seems to be built pretty well but time will tell
heres a link to an ab comparison i did with an sm57
i bought it for a silvertone sd10 which costs about 120
long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time
if the battery dies they are tone deaf
mine arrived in perfect condition
no onoff switch is a bummer but it works
order this with eyes closed
this will work fine for me i think
it works great for that
this is my third circuit breaker cable
ill still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well
so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey
but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package
especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time
picks make a big difference to sound and playability
you can just plug it into your keyboard and play
it is a solid well built guitar
exactly what i needed at a great price
it also wont stand evenly on end if thats important to you
ive never had these before until recently
otherwise its a good option at a good price
for the money it works
and thats all ive got to say about it
this product may actually be the ls10 killer
it has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister
this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice
ill never use another string on acoustics
i have been trying different ones
my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item
if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it
however i use it more as a frontend boost to my alreadyoverdriven bugera amp
i was very easy to assembly and looks great
simply a nice assortment of picks to try
well i guess it works
i play in a really loud metal band
what makes a good cable
im now a zoom fan
i seem to like them all
easy to install i used the guitars existing strap button screws
very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles
its cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard
on no setting could i get rid of
the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust
so now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works
the price its about right
its easy to install very tough and i love how it looks
this is not a bad product just not great
also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables
i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries
i recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand
i have used dunlop straplocks for 32 years
you cant beat this deal
but you need to attach it with something
this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings
it does not come with a mic clip so youll need to get one
i like the black side and the soft leather side
the beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loop
use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work
i like this a lot better than others that i have
i honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all
how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated
you can get pretty decent sound out of this
cons  so far none and i dont expect any
head era korn comes to mind for me
easy to use very accurate highly recommended
this amp is something else
theyve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house
good deal and i will purchase again
i highly recommend for the shred guitarist
it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices
it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right
but give behringer credit for providing a manual
i was skeptical because of the price but these work great
im using 18vdc to supply power and it deliverys a fat overdrive
ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly
way cheaper than i saw in guitar center
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
the plastic housing might not standup to the road
ill never buy their strings again
bending down picking them up then throwing
thats part of the fun of tubebased od
not only is it accurate and easy to use but its so convenient
tried all sorts of things oh brother
it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either
i also wouldnt recommend it for anyone just starting out
i gig and record with these
third buy it if you are looking for a new tuner
so i used the builtin microphone to tune my guitar
i figured id save a bit and get a couple more from amazon
just like every other strap of its kind
usually they are too small
produce is great price and good quality
here is the gorgeous tone i had missed
still for the price i had to give it four stars
ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one
rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the daddario flatwound
i need to have alot of pick speed
nope it isnt leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff
you adjust this right on the jam using a roller dial
the big 34selling point34 about the mm is that it has a top boost
i have to say i really couldnt feel the difference
for the price this is a pretty nice strap
if you need a longer cable buy a longer cable
its affordable and it works
i now know what i was missing all those years of not having one
this is just adequate for my use
i went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times
and it arrived in 4 days since i returned the first one
i get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks
tested with a les paul with burstbucker pros the hiss was overwhelming
reaper had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel asio
this tuner is affordable and it works well
i wont hold it against these windscreens
my guitar just love it
such a fantastic price on this cant beat it
this is a great buy for the money
i easily reommend this item
like it even if its a bit long for use at home
the capo is solid on the neck
i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on
the customer service is so easy and immediate its worth the piece of mind
i folds down to a very small size but is quite strong
you can tune all strings in same time
delivered promptly and in excellent shape
these picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side
picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly
i thought the size of an altoid tin
synthy  seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes
another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves
this makes me very happy
always loved the sound of the bb
you cant go wrong with these
i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably
they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price
using it as a foot pedal controller on my korg triton le
essentially a waste of money
i cant recommend this enough and the battery last a long time
it gets crackling knobs going again
when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection
these are excellent music stands
i have had 34swing trees34 for many guitars for years
i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much
theyre reliable and easy to use
this little box will give it to you
i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on
there are two ports for speakers on the back side i havent used yet
i doubt that the 200 stuff is much better
the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor
as another reviewer put it this wont replace your daw
the board i received came supplied with plenty of softsided velcro
i just might buy another 3pack
straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need
do not buy  it is a wast of money
i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry
the more  you spend the better
does not sound good with updated equipment line 6 equipment roland units
these strings are really quite good but i wouldnt call them perfect
i like it with the power supplyno batteries to fuss with
and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on
they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course
sure there should be nicerbetter product but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks
there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality
i would write them but thats their job
once you get the hang of this capo its wonderful
i have several of these
a deadsimple idea that works great
this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it
after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin
it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and wellmade
i dont think it picks up those long wavelengths so well
to my surprise there wasnt even any tape on it
i am really liking the size of this board
it is unusable until repaired
update  i have had this pedal now for about 1 12 years
the strings sound great and hold up to the 34whammy34 just fine
but low quality is low quality
oh as stated elsewhere these dont have trussrods
foldsup pretty compact for travel
this will b my 2nd one of these so to me its worth it
well built and looks even better in person than the picture
i love it when i am the only one using it
i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy
maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable
rings around the hole and stripe on the back
in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability
it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic
this one is definitely a hit
this is my first mixer
it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly
however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes
remember its a guitar tuner not an impact wrench
the 57 version is also like its shure counterpart
if you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you
this is a wonderful product for the price
crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch
rugged reliable and simple to understand
made in canada seems well built and durable
this pedal in short sucks
seems sturdy and well made as well
the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and its awesome
as with all boss  roland products the boss fs6 performs as designed
so be sure to try them out first before buying
there is a handle and a shoulder strap
i used the daddario j53 black nylon strings
they are not strap locks
i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second
ive had this for 4 days and so far its still working perfectly
hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though
a fender aftermarket product that didnt come with some sort of defect or problem
hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down
best clip on tuner i have ever purchased
all tube build in effects and line and speaker out
the fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great
so i decided to sign in and write this review
this does what you expect it stands up a guitar
to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts
it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price
i would not have been able to do that without this amp
a definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick
this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar
i definitely recommend this pedal
good sustain and strings are holding up well
theres an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back
im not grading the switch on that
feels little tiny but excellent gain
they screw in and hold things
i have several stands and this is the second one of these i bought
the ebow is a crazy concept
if you use all four fingers buy two sets
i am going with a wider one
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
the mike doesnt have an onoff switch perhaps its  only real deficiency
34 i also prefer the sn2 display
for the price though its hard to knock on them too much
the electronics are just fine on the guitar i got
i own the sn8 which btw is the best tuner ive ever used
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recordingproducing
this is a really strong capo
this string winder is adequate but not really solid
this stand really is pretty tough
88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing
what the more expensive model has going for it is looks
its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro
strike a note once and its sharp
great sounding sturdy enough build etc
i wouldnt recommend against this product
how do i know that youre wondering
all my stringed instruments have been fitted with tusq parts
still it packs a punch
it folds up easily and looks to be very well made
preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones
the only down side is that it doesnt come with an ac power adapter
i would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both
great little tuner very accurate and portable
i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals
it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset
i keep this with my battery tester for my actives
its about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability
it does sound ok other than being a little bright
this is a cool gadget
ive got at least 6 spares at home right now
sounds better than the ibanez or boss models  warmer and less processedsounding
not much to say really other then they are good strings and work
screw is actually two pieces wtf
very happy with my purchase
one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway
it has a nice red paint job
for the price they are awesome strings
i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr
i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great
i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for 80
excellent value and you know what
finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple
snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down
thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive
it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop
btw im an average grown man 57 165  more to come
working great on my stratocaster
eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve
im old school when it comes to these boxes
ieutf8qid1357264576sr81keywordsstraplockwhich seem a lot better and more sturdy
ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time
this is my first foray into that world
nice lookingnice sound and quality to these cables
this is a good quality microphone
this will fatten up the sound of a dry amp
i have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetishcom which works well
the leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps
i dont even have to play the guitar anymore it does it for me
50  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i dont use
the 10 pack price is amazing
from playing and singing piano recording guitar and vocals and other various positions
no tone control no presence control
good medium picks decent feel and sound
great speakers for portables like an ipod
these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument
that said for the price it is pretty good
save your money and order this through musicians friend
this might be the most expensivefeeling device i own
not even a year old
i am liking these more and more as time goes by
at a bar youll probably need to mic it or use the included lineout
the big music stores always mark up the prices very high
eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasnt expensive
i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap
all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders
looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars
i have yet to try them with my microphone
its also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db1w1m
this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal
i like these 942 pure nickel strings
the analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal
i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy
this is a black sponge for smaller mics
this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use
this is a really nice sturdy pedal with a really warm tone
both harps very bendable etc
so i just ordered another one of these
i hardly notice im actually wearing it
i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers
by the way i have a gdec 30 for sale
i didnt notice much of a change tonally
ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitars neck
this is one great piece
just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel
i got mine from musicians friend
it does what its supposed to do what else can i say
im guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel
still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed
you need to dedicate an fx bank now
as good as a hard case
i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals
i ordered a pitch black for 70
i found the tongsol to give me the best tone over all
great chromatic tuner at a great price  i love it
your guitar will be fixed surely
holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording
always a great sound at a great price
right now though id say great product
perhaps i didnt take the time
but no harm done still works great
this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body
i recommend for use of  1
my wife bought this guitar for me as a gift
the martin name is synonymous with quality
it was a direct replacement for the original
its literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps
i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners
its a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment
i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job
the secret is always use the least you can get away with
a dab will do ya
but a quick dialin with the electronic tuner brought that right
compared to my old cable the mogami gold produced a more transparent sound
makes a fair snare drum mic
they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference
pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change
very very easy to install and protects
from stereo to 51 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs
roll of the dice i guess
playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever
the design is really pragmatic and effective
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone
this is more common in vintage guitars though
i found the product without too much difficulty
just to name a few
great pedal once you get it dialed in
i kinda demands output to another devicemixeramp if you want to play loud
with the exact same settings the fulltone will actually sound much brighter
fuzz 1 is a creamy midrange filled sound
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
good display and very easy to use
these should last a long time as long as theyre not abused
my level is usually around 25 to 40 and is still very loud
for that 5 stars easy
unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin
but since it does its a good place to hide a 3000 gibson 335
i have a electric bass guitar and needed to capo
that would make it easier to grab and use
above all this mustang is musical
however adding a 10 for this item is worth it
ive owned loop stations dm4s jam mans samplers and all that jazz
if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more
the plugs are the standard screwdown type with well soldered  joints
i used it with live 8
for the adjusting screw stand fullsizedfor 20 bucks
then again they might make all the difference in the world
they also last a long time before they go dead
the front metallooking grill is mesh but quality and looks great
its just a matter of attention to detail
further it will not add something else to findloose in my pants pocket
the sound has better definition
for the ts pedals in this price range its the most useful
im very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job
it is growing on me and i wouldnt part with it now
this tin should last a lifetime
this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack
no big deal i just tune it at 12th fret
it is want i need for travel
attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product
other than that i like the pockets and overall design
dunlop also makes quality picks and i have yet to break one of these
another excellent gadget from planet waves
for the price its definitely worth it imho
i am disappointed in this thing
this was my first strap
and after 30 years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings
theres no audio interface this affordable
a drop of wood glue fixed it
its small enough that you can leave it on in the case
they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackityclack noise
yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that
it sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it
i also think the price is pretty fair
this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning
however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp
luckily one of the band members had another one
it is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike
i know ill never be able to blow it away
in fact i like it so well
it does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality
it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well
it does everything its supposed to do
again these should really come standard on all american strats
made in germanyquality musical instrumentnot a toy
it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars
ive purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one
i note that there are reviews here as old as four years
so i did a little research
i only use 34 pedals and this is always one of them
they are easy to install on the bass and the strap
i will be using this model and brand as long as they make them
come with all cables needed
they just dont feel as solid to me
ill be honest here  i bought this one primarily because of its looks
it arrived quickly and was well packaged
had the battery not been an issue i would have rated this 5 stars
oh well for once i got cheap
very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight
the price is right for what you get
if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one
but its just not for me
this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved
my playing sucks  sounds better with these strings
they also make one with the 90 degree 14 inch input as well
i highly recommend these tuners
i used the screws and it was an easy install
appearance  build  the loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures
cant even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like
my buddy likes the case so i am happy
i use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome
not much to write about here but it does exactly what its supposed to
i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic
most under 400 guitars dont have good pickups so why spend extra money
it fits good and came in the color i expected
simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp
it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden
decent holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles
my fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought
this is the greatest practice amp ever
you can power any lightweight 9v 12 or 18v stompbox with this
bought several of these and they worked fine
i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport
053 strings in both phosphor bronze and 8020 bronze
it works great for me i like this type of straps simple  durable
i do recommend this one
led indicators good and flash the speed
great product with nice feel and tone
however once i opened it i discovered an undamaged snark tuner inside
not special but not disappointing either
this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand
i also use one on my pedal board wouldnt use anything else
i love this capo better than any i have seen or used
but all are for radiused fingerboards
it also allows you to knock the heck out of it
bottom line this is my favorite headstock tuner
yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows
i purchased this model for home usenot for a kids backpack
just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly
or they begin their rave review with for a 150 amp
measured how loud this thing is
i got the 50 standard black on black case
this is a lovely wall mount for your guitar
thumb to little finger i can barely reach an octave on piano
it does jusy exactly whats expected
not much to say about a basic bag
after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase
thats doesnt leave much room for tone tweaking so tweakers beware
dont worry about the 34thing34 hanging inbetween your strings
try them if its quality sound that youre looking for
i would definitely buy these strings again
i got 2 of these for grandkids
its really cheap product but it works really well
very well made and beautiful
making you work on your technique and become a better player
ill update this review when i find out just how long they do last
the light from the leds has a blue tint to it
it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not
ive never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars
ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitars
so i gave this to him to save some time
i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations
clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer
the tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place
i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed
i have other similar models and they are all great
cigar box guitar 3 string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna 6 string
knobs and switch are sturdy
these are great little tuners
this tape will definitely fill the requirement
this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned
note its vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference
it does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price
smooth as silk work great  as all grovers do
i got this pedal cause is not so expensive and i love music
for most metalhard rock music the gain range is enough for me
if anything they feel worse than regular strings
its a beautful guitar and and im loving it
obviouslyin my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs
do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product
ive tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best
you cant go wrong with this
it comes in different colors also
has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models
basically this is a niche tuner
i keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases
this plug works very well
for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile
nothing gave me better tuning on the first try
youll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter
that being said this has been the best interface ive ever owned
good product at a good price
has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition
ive been using these picks for 10 years theyve always been great
the fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price
not only that but im actually getting to be notthatbad at playing either
it plugged into my behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely
however i like the look of sm58 and it seems to be extremely durable
i bought this for my son and he loves it
they also work well with acoustical guitar
good cheap strings for guitar
bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board
if you wanna be that one fat hawaiian guy israel kamakawiwoole go for it
its small and conveniently stored too
winds the strings fastpulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wiredoes not scratch my guitar
id describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge
overall a good buy for a backup strap or your primary
comes out as easy as it goes in
clamp it on press the power switch and then  pluck a string
if youre looking to buy a capo id recommend this over a kyser
great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
much lighter and thinner then any strap that i have had
i would not do that without this straplok
good quality and doesnt cost very much
check these things out you will not be disappointed
they send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase
it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have
these are the thickest picks ive ever used
hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables
this is a great product and i highly recomend it
i really liked the sound
these just happen to be my favorite
i had to give it a shot
high quality and great design
also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little
id say the level is beginnerintro level sound and quality
i used doublesided sticky tape  problem solved
attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head
but if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the tone
i have two and would buy again if i needed another one
all in all this is a great guitar strap
holds my acoustic 6 string great
its almost like having two stompboxes in one
tight tuning and easily used
but for the budget i do receomend it
maybe thats just a matter of taste but otherwise this is a great stand
i gave it 4 stars on just expectation
same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new
comes with dual locking strap holes on each end
i like that its adjustable to various heights
i used a different color cable for each function
this box does the trick
ill do this to my other acoustics as time goes on
i bet more than a few of these quietly show up in nashville studios
setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic
perfect for my line 6 75 wt
thats whats most important right
this is my fifth time buying this stuff
it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone
i used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly
a quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them
cost less here than at guitar center so badabing
some headstocks too may be too thick in order to attach this tuner
updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses
this tool has high marks for one reason  it works
they should have included something that doesnt fall apart
you could make it work
i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome
they shipped quickly and i will order again and again
great tone great string life with a little maintenance and very reasonably priced
i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power
but for the price it does work a lot better
i would not suggest this to anyone
on stage i prefer microphone boom holders
the tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use
now im buying another strap so i will have one on either guitar
sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose
the adjustable stand also works great and wont fall on you or anything
the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that
i have never heard my guitar sound so good
warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one
an inexpensive mode that looks and works great
i still write all my songs on this and play it more then my
most modern devices will do just fine
when i order something new i expect it to be new
my daughters use all of them every week
let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel
dava 6024 grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey
not literally a right angle but a very good angle
compared to elixirs these are a bit brighter with good feel
ive long been partial to daddario stringsi dont have a guitar without them
i did purchase the protection plan for 10 so im covered for 2 years
this really cleans your strings
unity is around 8 oclock on the level knob
i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it
i will be working on this
ive owned them for a few months now
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone
drop few more bucks and get something else
this is a really nice item and i got two of them
i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage
whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar
shipping was great along with packaging
the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good
not sure what else can be said about a capo
after hearing how great it is i decided to buy it
beautiful sound and very well made
awesome product to keep your axe looking great
for a normal use this is quite good
his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products
if you cant make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech
no frills just a plain black strap
i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice
obviously i think it a good product
its great and stands up to much more expensive of its kind
if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you wont be disappointed
so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd
the price is great im planning to have several of this
now my gear is always ready
ive heard that the adhesive doesnt work on rubber wood etc
if i lost this box id immediately order another one
use on blue strat and looks great
the fit of the headphones is big for me
and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security
the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed
cheap stuff a budget brand trying to pass as a name brand
analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic
there is a big and a small slot
these headphones are almost perfect
would buy these again ifwhen i acquire new guitars
this inexpensive capo works as advertised
they sounded great all up  down the fret board
this makes it very comfortable
the name is pronounced phonetically as follows  dadairyo
i bet marcus would kill with them
i love these little guys
i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did
this handy little device will fit perfectly in any outoftheway spot on your instrument
then i tried the digitech rv7
this model has the cedar top
if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars
it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar
has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer
this pick holder is awesome
i cant recommend them highly enough
with practice i think this could improve
tuner is right on overdrive seems fine
it appears to be well made and durable
there is another review here where the user states they didnt receive enough velcro
if you need 34light34 maybe keep looking
for the price it is hard to beat
this board does the job for at least 6 pedals
with this new capo i am happy to use it
i believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand
i bought this to tote my pod hd500 around
the locking diecast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure
since i paid about 13 for this i was not expecting a great deal
i never had a problem with their stuff
this is a quality stand
nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners
they play and sound softer
the experience for me has been pure jamming joy
fortunately it was a c1
the jig method is super easy and provided great results
i own several of the snark tuners
stays in place and works as de
oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar
you can get a tutorial to do anything on youtube
oh well it was cheap enough to have around
to my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar
the guitar is 3ply plastic blackwhiteblack
i honestly was not impressed
best 3 ive ever spent
bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable
more tubelike sound than a toprated tube amp
i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss
the chord works great no noticeable buzz
this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar
a rat is a rat whether theyre coming from china or the usa
but this for the quality
built like a tank  brushed finish  connections on the front
i absolutely love them for my fenders
for the price cant beat it
for the tube amp snobs
and the string winder itself also works well
incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes
heres my takepros  cheap
its got a better build quality than the snark for sure
under the strings and it muffled a few
of course none of this means i will stop buying od pedals
great unit for the price
bottom line  this is a fantastic 5star device
i am happy with this product and will order some more in the future
ill update this review if i ever figure it out
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick
replenished my dried out fretboard to likenew condition
i have these on all my guitars
i have to admit my own vocals arent perfect
the way you string the guitar makes a difference
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both
it probably wont protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack
i didnt hear it when i mixed my hafler m1 speakers
good quality and very good sound
works exceedingly well for any use
i have two other fuzzsswollen pickle  mxr 108 classic fuzz
ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine
this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online
does a great job of checking cords
the tuning is accurate the lcd screen is clearly visible it works great
this is not a distortion petal like the boss ds1 or metal zone mt2
goes great with my guitar too
i bought these to try them out
comes with a capacitor so thats a bonus
i bought these guitar picks for my son
so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again
im not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should
let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that ive tried
i have not had one fail on me ever
that is what i notice most from the hds compared to the regular
the user guide is informative
the inside of the one i received was grey fur
same deal laughter of the immortals
will purchase more as needed
but some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle
but its really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise
no wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category
large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place
as always this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy
they also came with two velcro ties each
it is a very good value though
guitars at that price may be twice the cost
purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative
if not for that id have rated 4 stars
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board
once in place it stays there with no slipping
i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor
anyway these are great guitar picks if youre looking for something solid and longlasting
i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side
i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads
they fit on the athm50 headphones
you can still monitor your playing using the ipads headphone jack separately obviously
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
well made and easy to adjust
but something as thick as an a string
what it does  first a quick word about compression
not for long seasons anyway
i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads
the exps are nice strings
i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these
it has its own level btw
i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u2 etc
joyo jf03 crunch distortion   this little guy surprised me
thats not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps
once you setup your pedalboard
they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups
great price for 12 picks spanning from light  heavy
the quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch
very pleased with this item
rough handling will probably break it
you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps
overall they are attractive wellmade hangars
it also has a 14 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well
especially if you like to save your single strings for use
the rubber grip area is a joy to hold
where else can you get a greatfunctioning delay pedal for this price
however chilling them did work well enough
i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades
good  power supply for the cheaper yamaha keyboards
i bought the martin strap to match the color
get a 10 foot and be free
its a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations
good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead
you can talk into your instrument
you will not be dissappointed at all
bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesnt cost much
he really likes it a lot
the leather is thick and supple
nice pics that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
no modifications needed not even bending
these are such comfortable picks
the optional carry bag is a must imho
im a huge fan of these strings now
its solid and works great very adjustable
further its class complaint so you dont have to use behringers drivers
no issues in that regard with the fatso
i dont really know if its better than other brands or not
this is not my only capo but its my cheapest
not the cheapest but worth the money
thanks for such a great price amazon
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away
the unit itself has held up well
my apologies to those pros out there who didnt need this clarification
it works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar
ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it
this mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar amps
it takes up very little space the biggest plus
just a basic female xlr to 14 inch male adapter
it was about 5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine
while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking
this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height
uncoated strings last me about a month
can be done but not as good
ive had good success with this piece
i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead
design looks great in the light too
i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r16
thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web
he paid about 350400 for his kit still cheap by todays standards
isnt that what its all about
it flashed a locked tempo but i really dont need that feature
im not sure what else to say
once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different
theyre made in the usa
i plugged in my martin hd28 and all went well
and all martin products are second to none
i compared this to a c1 which is pretty good for half the price
i absolutely love these strings
after all thats 2 more strings than its intended purpose
i bought this to sell mainly but now
its got a nice look too
they do what they are suppose to do and do it well
the only thing the other has on this one is its size
so far it is working well for me
but my mexistrat is now complete
i like the planet waves instrument cables
i like them but i love the schaller locks more
they appear to be very well built and sound just fine
when i wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth
build it to your specs and have a solid stand
its surprisingly loud for a small amp
its called train your people
sweet action durable and very affordable
it does what it is suppose to do
nice bright screen perfect and the price is right
there are two ways to think of this pedal
we all have our preferences but im not an ernie ball fan
get one and have fun
i like the gripping surface
havent had an issue with any in the 45 months weve had them up
but this pedal gives me everything that i want
amazon had it and at a good price
since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice
i didnt expect much considering the price
i just really like the look feel and features of this smart design
honestly i would get the hybrid slinkys over these
dunlop makes good quality products
the behringer monitors do the job well
but for seven bucks it gets the job done
this is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin
then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm
mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat
the quality control is so so
if amazon used halfstars i would have given them 355
now on to the guitar itself
the output is muted while the tuner is engaged
i have these on all three of my fenders
and what to do if one does fail
but is more than twice better
less gradation in setting than other tuners
very pleasantly surprised buy this one
with that in mind its perfect
i am sure this will give him years of entertainment
emery cloth for polishing frets is niceworth 2000for sure
when i tested it out i was blown away
the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing
it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation
little harder to read than i would have liked especially in sunlight
so i had to order a clip later
not for me maybe for you
cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue
i always go with elixirs
they had mimimal oilstain from the factory
all 5 star reviews on this baby
chorus is on the mellower side
i tried these and they make for much easier action
preamp power works well with condenser studio mikes
update   i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx 802
they sound and feel great
everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings
mounting holes are drilled right screws pass right through and fit perfectly
i believe i have been wishing for this for years
available in several finishes to match your taste
nothings worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple
major fail on their part
for 10 bucks this is great very sturdy and reliable
shoulder strap works just fine
ive done it successfully for years
i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued
a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic
perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable
dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal
cant say much more than the description
these picks are kind of thin flexible and have a good rubber grip
a thumbs up for this one
good value for the price
i dont trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws
they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics
5 so what does it sound like
ive noticed that the current 34most helpful critical review34 mentions this same problem
it would be nice though not to have had to do that
the amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 watts
i bought this because the tuner in the rp1000 is pretty sloppy
the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal
they have a great rating from other musicians
i have been using on stage instrument and microphone stands for several years now
the tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice
i have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners
do i get a fortune cookie with that
what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it
pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies
so when i needed more strings i just got fenders
i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
its a cheap box that works
for years i have used a kyser capo because i like the trigger action
i regret this purchase for what i paid for it
and i like it for starting out learning
good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china
the sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing
if youre a froosh fan like me than look no further
terrific allinone musthave tool for guitarists
not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased
i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm
fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar
runs on one cr 2032 pancake batteryincluded
it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths
until i crank the dial over and shred some faces
i can tell a slight difference
for others they may not appreciate this
my stand doesnt tip over like the others
i am old school and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful
much better sound perfect fit etc
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
i grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed
this thing really is a puzzler
it picks up anything it is attached to
i would probably say it exceeds your expectations
it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparseacousticclean backgrounds
well worth the money spent
i was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp
so i and many others play nickel
this works just as stated
i tossed it aside and bought a fender gigbag
anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority
i didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is
i will never switch from the pick
i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh
however it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar
italian made need i say more
had mine for 2 years now and no complaints still as good as new
i choose this one because it was very durable
for the price i dont think you can do better
frankly id like to see a baritone version
i just think it could have been better designed
see my previous evaluation on a similar product
after that the guitar was splendid
its awkward to apply and remove quickly
these are mirrored by 60 userdefined profiles which are identical to the factory presets
this means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever
i could not ask for better for this price
very stable and they make tuning a joy
fabulous clean tone and great distortion sound running off a solidstate amp and pedals
i use it on my taylor 910ce taylor 718e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
but dont let that deter you
only thing is that it is big
other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems
i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass
it works and like it says it reduces the noise
why would you do that boss
is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet
i think tascam would be wellserved taking that into account
this is a good one at a good price
low action and stays in tune for days
i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics
and no i dont own stock in the company
when it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner
a bunch of years ago a variety of cliponmicrophones began to be marketed
multivoltage capability for worldwide use powering eight pedals and very cost effective too
lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument
the detailsthe amp itself is tiny
i didnt believe it myself
this has been commented on before
all in all they both are the best of all the ones ive tried
that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm57
the quality is good and they look and function well
but it isnt a huge difference
the price is darn good as well
ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home
play the slow 4 chords to maggot brain
i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar
when i first felt this strap i smiled
you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube
my young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one
the microcube came with new ac adaptor that supports 110v and 240v
these light strings go from
the picks work well and they dont wear out easily
its not an entire bridge assembly but its exactly what i needed
but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka
and with 12 strings it really put a lot of tension on them
i bought this tuner for my mandolin
im very pleased with the pedal and couldnt be happier
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
you dont even need to hear it
for hifi music recording however youll notice it is a cheap mic
having two tone controls makes all the difference
i have used all kinds of strings
i just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting
summary if you need a preamp buy this one
and for its price its well worth it
the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul
i have one of these as well as several other microphones
will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much
placing after the distortion pedal sounded better
nice quality at an unbelievable price point
they are still going strong
from stern to port this instrument shines
its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing
i like the durability of it and the onoff switch
i love the open feel from these picks
so thats a consideration if youre a beginner
cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks
it is an ok strap
same goes for the boss ds1
form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed
arrived quick and before scheduled
this amp did a good job for its rating
the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable
i have purchased six of these over the last couple years
its a great pick holder but im not fond of the sticky background
for the money this is a great guitar case
i dont know why some people hate it
i have a marshall amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers
in the c windowsinf folder there must exist two files wdmausb
some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge
he is another cool use for this pedal
the leather is rather soft
all dimarzio products are incredible
i bought this for my acoustic
oh and one thing im a bit iffy about is spectraflexs lifetime warranty
after i plugged this little bad boy in it brought my amp to life
id still not abuse them too much though
great product worth every penny
now this is one great piece of kit
bought 6 to replace to older models i had on stage
the string winder is a little awkward
ill update this review if i have more to report
i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound
this is my 3rd vox amplug i have purchased through amazon
this pedal is outstanding for the price
i held out from trying the boss sd1 super overdrive for many years
you simply attach the dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar
012s and this is one of my prize acoustics now
other reviews had complained about a toolow action
it is a good pedal
it is not variable speed
fortunately things have changed for the better
its meant to be left on an instrument
i own one of each model
its easy to rename the files you just open wdmausbinf
line 6 please go to sdhc
nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great
ie 12ay7 12at7 and the mullard 12ax7
well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one
it only works with a power adapter no battery
this is a must have
the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted
a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this
is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier
the primary effect of compression is to level or normalize the output across frequencies
easy to use and very accurate
these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors
it is simple to use though and it makes a lot of noise
i have to say this string cleaner is a must have
better than going to the always overpriced guitar center
i loved it very much
my capo is 8 years old
the bass attack pedal did not disappoint
this music light has one drawback it doesnt have a master switch
if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong
i could not order that arm separately
best deal and does the job
unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging
i would highly recommend this to you guitar players
it is of course difficult to tune when others are playing around you
i fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability
more organic than plastic picks
wider than a 6 string but not much
i definitely feel relieved to have them off
good quality for the price
the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes
this product does what you want and is easy to take on and off
unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners
hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro
i own a piece of the legend and music history
the pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too
its tuning range is 12 note
played for another few hours and they sound fantastic
easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators
i totally recommend this product  you wont be dissappointed
they were always losing their picks
the sound out of these things is pristine
i replaced the factory strings with these
ive got to be missing something here
and nice its like really just wow
i am not calling him or her out or anything
read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal
i havent seen that in any amp in this price range
and my tele sounds as great as it always did
it was inexpensive and fun to use
i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great
but then again i didnt have to buy these
they fit one of mine perfectly and another not very well
ive been using ableton for 4 years and it never crashes
first some clarification is needed on 34tube34 vs
no to all the above
if youre looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely
this is the one to get
because well 0o it is a lp
a good moderately priced guitar stand
my guitar is safe now with this hard case
i will use it until i can find a better one
it seems to keep things humidified very well
with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking
and at a great price to boot
ive been using them for years and they work amazingly
the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic
fit and installationregarding fit these have 2 little pins on the backside
its halpfull in stage because you dont need to test each string individually
on my electrics i love extra light 8 gauge strings
and folds up in to a small package
i leave the choice of that to you the reader
still this is a good deal
no 15watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings
it does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back
i could never get the sound i wanted using other manufacturers strings
this is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner
these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily
the snark sn8b is my favorite so far
the are strong durable and sound good
cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me
downside seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings
its not great for gig use as the screen isnt that readable
one the back side of the strap is not black
the 9s are super slinky just like the name says
they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had
pretty much defends its self from the old 7080s songs
i began reading online about muffled audio on windows 7 pcs
first real harmonica i have owned
the downside is it is not granular enough to say intonate an instruments bridge
i purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear
consider taking my advice  treat yourself
making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable
quite simply this is a really nice guitar
this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods
cab is made of super cheap particle board
hosa guitar cables work great
this is so out there that i wont let it influence my rating
schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with locktite
for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well
thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review
this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops
however the tone is different
i installed this in two minutes
this tuner did just fine with the low b on a 5 string bass
i have bone on all of my guitars
great gig bag for acoustic guitar
no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck
i stand by that review
the packaging materials said that i should have received a cd in the package
this little 12inch model is highpitched but has that trashy wuhan sound
a  34musthave34 if you play in pits or other dimlylit venues
forget about all the presets
i hear it can be used on other boss and roland gear
and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc
the civilians wont notice the difference
its simple easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound
the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive
be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied
makes it look really smart
it sounds great right out of the box
my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff
this is more for your parlor acoustic setup
light construction but  you get what you pay for
you should have one of these in each gig bag
the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves superhandy elastic cord wrap
if the strings are in individual labeled packages theres no need for the colors
it changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar
that means you get one position
i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products
output of high quality material also sounds superb
bwoosh loop  no tingting
the us322 comes with a printed quick start guide
i highly recommend this petal
it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked
i absolutely adore this instrument
however to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable
ok im surprised that this unit is now over 1500
buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string b3
either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly
hardly any breaks considering i get the thin ones
no there is still a little digital overlay around in there
normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater
i like it4 star rating according to amazon
dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up
youn name it i have tried it
imho this the must have addition to your set up
ive always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards
its the only strap ive ever used
great for back up singers
the best part is the price
they rotate in full circles and are super durable
i bought this harmonica for our son
he tunes it to itself
picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks
its a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft
you can hear the difference once it is used
does not leave streaks if used properly
there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat
very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable
i have many planet waves cables
when in the studio this is where the pedal shines
but i think if youre lucky if just might get the job done
its very simple and is perfect for me
it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well
durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes
i say perfection because this amp does exactly what i wanted it to do
took them off within an hour and put back on ej16
the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected
built like a tank and completely configurable
could not get to fit small sound hole
if you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out
so all said i still prefer my kyser
has a 14in jack to easily plug into a guitar amp
go with the fast fret
as for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree
i would recommend these they look great
it does what it is designed for
i like its simplicity and reliability
these strings are beyond amazing
works well while other things are going on around you
this cradles my guitar nicely
id say definitely do not get this if youre a tech or gear head
i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect
my mom bought me this one
it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target
everything about it is exactly how you would want it to be
when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar
its cheaper and works very well
the cops wont come knocking to serve a noise complaint
well those reviewers were right  the pitch correction function has no effect
i got the package of two
so far i am a very satisfied customer with this cable
i put dark nail polish over the led bulb
the samson tech support was friendly enough but not very helpful
i really love monster cables
dont know what the delay was but it took forever to get here
that being said its a great little stand for low dutyhome use
this is a fantastic little capo
well they werent very close anyway
this unit is of high quality though
the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb
they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most
and the price makes it a real bargain
ive been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase
install it and you never have to worry about it again
i was sure glad that i ordered this cable as a backup
i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up
i plan on getting a few more of these
other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing
a lil awkward for some
it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats
update  january 7 2013
not all chords are in here but the 34core34 chords are
they still work years later
i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing
they take great care to pack it well so no worries their either
it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned
made me able to use a strap on my guitar
measuring is best with a cooperative assistant
these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune
i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar
it is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this
turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when youre not playing
i like fender mediums because i use them on both bass and guitar
i have always been happy with the planet waves products
these were purchased for my parts bin
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals
this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it
other than being a little cheaply built it works great
with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag
and for the price you really cant beat it
my son plays electric and acoustic guitar
keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine
the string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly
with the humidpak you have a lot more security
that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere
they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway
looks like it is holding up so far
i have always liked daddarios packaging
but it sounds great when your recording songs
the contrast helps you see what your doing
its regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard
it cuts my signal a bit
you gotta bend over and flip those
my tone knob has never been more useful
when it comes to quality of cables im really not to picky about it
there was one review that mentioned it isnt for female vocalists
but overall this is a great guitar
they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons
to say that they did less wouldve gotten the 1 star
for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start
maybe if youre using this to run a pa i would recommend it
not having a cable was kinda a big deal
they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job
my cpu is windows 7 but it worked on my msi netbook also
this is a good pick
the super slinkys sound great
it has a remote to control it
i bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar
the lows sound present and clear
not here plenty of room for everything now
if you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals
i use drums so nobody else gets hurt
consumers require choice but with the shure sm58 there need be none
this time i got a 3 pack of ej163d light
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it
but it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase
the guitars do not sit very well in this stand
i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have
this works great for micing guitar amps
for the money it costs it worth it
first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand
great sound over the original strings
i really like the footswitch
at the end im satisfied with the 2035
its sturdy and very portable
not sure yet on the new line
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal
i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs
i bought the abalone ones because they look cool
this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used
i tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much i like them
that could be cord issues or box issues
this is a perfect compliment to my current set up
i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings
its worth it if youre not in a hurry
what may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone elses palate
it seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks
i dont plan on moving it so it works for me
to top it all off the price is right
this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used
the things it wont do  1 a clean boost
great surprise as i never took rogue seriously
great sound that only a bone nut can produce
are they as good as dedicated 100 per stomp box effects
the stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport
needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag
arrived very fast inexcellent shape
i normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal
the product works perfectly and is durable
for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once
you should check out the 78 badasss distortion from mxr too
i got it for my les paul epiphone uke
makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier
correct me if im wrong
it does not sound like that in the recordings though
the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the onoff switch
they are also priced very good
the coating is much heavier than that of other strings
worth the money for certain
eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one
34 it really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing
these strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely
in my sample of 2 it made highend guitars sound worse
and the functionality is great
one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply
not much to say about a xlr cable
i have tried other picks like this that had points which went as confortable
theyve been stepped on and treated pretty rough
i have been using the behringer acx450 for six months now
thats a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses
this is heavy but strong
no reason i cant make something like that on my own though
this is not my first planet waves locking strap
change them its a very quick fix
i really should send this pos back to amazon
the only complaint i have is that there is no onoff switch
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand
ive used both the es57 and es58 for several years now
good product at a great price
i used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show
i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that ive had for years and years
wow yes that is it
coated strings usually lack the bright highend brilliance that uncoated light strings have
decent quality ends and build
high points for the delays reverbs and mods
as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand
couldnt be happier with this product
it will clip on anything you want to hold it
thats an a in my book
this thing sounds completely transparent when its off and completely natural when its on
good quality cable and price
i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band
the tone is very good but not exceptional
it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying
cant ask for more than that
that certainly explains the difference in price
its inexpensive and easy to use
i had trouble with strings going out of tune too often
despite appearances this mic is no bargain
so these are  pretty great strings
it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it cant
ive had many mic holders and this one is by far the very best
bucks for an 8input mixer
to me it wasnt even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs
its a short boom but it works great
luckily i have no need for the clip
it is durable and effective
i imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing
compact size makes storage easy
i play resonator guitars open tuned
i use these on my hofner and gibson es135
no sharp points to damage the guitar
buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately
pads take too much presure to activate
you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig
this pedal is great only a couple notes i should make about it
it is easy to use
ive been stringing my guitars with daddario for several years
i have to of them
the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion
i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables
amazonhas placed it there as a public service
this guitar is just for you to practice scales practice a tune
however now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome
i always have a set in each case
i prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that
turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean
the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs
it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand
i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life
i was immediately struck by how solid this case feels
highquality cable for expanding the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v power adapter
tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well
they work very well for my needs
i just used this for a gig on monday
the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth
i love these pick holders
i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing
i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one
yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible
for the money i have no complaints
i havent noticed any sound issues at all
the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb
i will buy these again
you have to be committed to dealy
strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded
a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less
it looks and performs like a studio filter
the em600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps
being from tampa i wanted my first guitar to be a dean
bonus its an active device so it can boost the signal
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
highly recommend to everyone looking for a case
in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder
my problems with it are 3 fold   1
i guess i need a little practice
but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent
love my assortment of picks and the price was right
its cheap and easy to use
i surely will continue to experiment
i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great
the only strings i get are ernie ball strings
next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing
i wanted to try these since the under 5 price is good
one of the better trems ive had the pleasure to use
the snark sn1 is small accurate and easy to use
a pop filter is essential
wish it had more speed variance but its great for the price
really satisfied with the chair
rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap
maybe a little clearer cleaner sound
havent popped one outa my fingers yet
true bypass means no tone suck to boot
the effects sound excellent to me
i have been using strap locks of all types for years
these are great tuners and they look great
i have received many compliments on the look of it already
i put these strings on every acoustic i own
also i compared them to the sennheiser hd201
but passable id return it if i could
i would recommend to anyone
steelstring dreadnought archtop jazz box and les paul worked nicely
they fit great and plenty of screws
im glad i finally decided to get it
i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly
i like ernie ball strings
got this for my electric guitar
i wouldnt perform with it but great for personal use
its not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well
theyre great for quick movement around the fret board
it also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic
ive bought a number of these for use on my pedal board
i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas
didnt know until i sampled quiet a few
i am running a dj karaoke system
the highs are very tinny
it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box
not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine
mediums do great but the thin fall right out
make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual
phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should
to hold it in place when in storage or transport
works just as i need it to
not much else to be said
i received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar
here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
other than that it is what it is and does what it says
this is the best capo around and works great
i love the tone and the reverb for 100 is amazing
i hope hes right cause i love this little tuner
it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many
wah this is always available and active in the x3 and below
i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly
reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken
this is a terrific product
for most vocals recording i dont use the closet
it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles
survived a trip in a moving van from philly to boston
they say 24 months ive never come close to even a month
id rather just pretend that florida didnt exist
this strap fits the bill just fine
i am so happy she did
it wont budge once you clip it and its low profile
these are not shure sm58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs
every microphone has it uses
the only thing i would do to improve is add an off button
the lines for the strings and frets are very close together
i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it
this is just your typical nylon strap a bit stiff but durable
but it really does the job good tone
i said good not loud
i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something
however its not for all acoustic guitars
speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first
the snark is by far my favorite
i have always liked these sticks
i can afford to pay twice as much
for this price it is a do not recommend for me
this is my first fender amp and probably not my last
i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently
buy this and enjoy it
you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours
back plate has a greenish tint and is single ply not 3ply as advertised
i find it stays in tune like a 34instrument34 should now
053 and high e and b each increasing
i got these for my dad for christmas
it is not meant for heavy rockmetalgrunge type music
i love mine  so do my friends
as another guy said 34not better not bad simply different34 its true
for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems
schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players
its like a hard plastic not metal like most are
do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings
i ended up returning the whole shooting match
ive polished many guitars multiple times
ive owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk
a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design
i use it for a hot rod deluxe
i bought 2 of these as controllers for my alesis drum machine
not worth shipping it back no big deal
besides batteries arent that expensive
the tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great
i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc
takamine makes many excellent instruments this included
it took at least 15 minutes to do that update
they have a good amount of bass
snap is large and holds well but is easy enough to unsnap when needed
good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind
the microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand
if youre uncomfortable dealing with eq this might not be your best bet
this arm is a direct replacement for the original
on a guitar strings are everything
compression smooths over these problems and levels everything to a polished presentable sound
this is a good quality strap
its like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on
one doesnt get much better than daddario strings
and the price is right
and the cybertwin is gone now
they all sound very cool on this amp
not much to say here other than it works and works well
the tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost
ive had it on for 2 and a half months now with no problems
the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately
built to last and great price as well
it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase
but like many newer players i didnt know any better at the time
it does work well and will power many pedals at one time
this strap is pretty thin
thats what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in youtube
they provide you with an activation code after you register
you have to see the guitar face to face to understand what i mean
thankfully i dont change strings too often
okay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive
i could not beat the price
the construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts
i bought another set for the ovation this time
value for money it cant be beat
its a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job
it is after all a cheap chinese stand
but thats expected and not that big of a deal if youre careful
while this is not a 300 tape delay
as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur
sold great quality xlr mic
i thought they would be the same but they were not
hvr considering the price i think its excellent
it does know when your guitar is in tune
just remember to hold the power button to turn it off
or so their packaging claims
what can you expect for 20 tho
it wont a guitar break
so if you want 24 different distortions go for it
oh well i got stuck with two microphones without onoff switch
take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal
nice microphone stand for the cost
and its a great midi controller
great simple pedal clean sound
simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively
so i was dieing to feel them
the girls will love you and the boys too
be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order
combined with joyos california hendrix is almost in the house
i was really looking forward to receiving this amp
you knew that when you bought it
it saves time when restringing a guitar
i also use it to intonate my guitar
that is what i wanted
it is certainly an easy change
this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does
and with the lifetime guarantee you really cant go wrong here
both ends are the same  leather
different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use
i love the unique selflocking mechanism that it has
it is a real standout in value
this is a great little uke for the money
its no better or worse than a tripod stand at twice the cost
this thing can do anything
for blues jazz or light rock its brilliant right out of the box
for the price this is one of the best pop filters
are you kidding me at this low price
also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isnt
this pedal is simple durable affordable 40  45 and it just works
this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope
easy to install and use and very reasonable price
this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance
the two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable
its low profile and is easy to switch by foot
however the angle makes that very awkward
and then to go out to test some more
it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now
overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal
even at the price its sold at the build quality is pro level
its very inexpensive needs a little work sounds very good
i move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly
it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt
these are thin and flexible
they dont break either although they do wear down over time
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made
its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing
behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny
the pedal generates  a lot of 34noise34 so i cant use it
the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains
this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1 so it buzzes longer
great tone sustain and flexibility
still a great product its just a little flimsy
there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall
i always use ernie ball on everything
one wouldnt fit in my soundboard another wouldnt lock in my mic
this is a great combination
only slightly better than 05
truly a great piece of gear
over all i think daddario is great for warm balance tones
nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar
the box for tuner was a little smushed
i would recommend this to anyone
no buttons levers or knobs
planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product
good thing i didnt trust the plastic anchors
overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is bluesoriented
update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer
better than i expect i going to order 2 more
it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar
also a great mike for doing voiceovers
these strings feel great and sound fantastic
so in a way this is the most important pedal you can have
but this isnt advertised as a clean boost pedal
i imagine it would hold beer too
i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric
almost annoyingly hard to get one out
bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones
not sure about longterm durability or signal lossinterference
its not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable
im just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider
it goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily
but i discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds
i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist
the 7000 model does the same and doesnt take as much space
it was what i had expected it to be
this made me take a second look at schaller
this is a great effect
the drum presets are fun to use
got them in 3 days
both capos had this very same problem
it is also small which i appreciate
fx on turns on a little delay effect
im a pro musician and music teacher
however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity
my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs
it fits well on my les paul and strat
i will also say that if you can find one used  buy it
always experimenting with my sound
if i lost it i would definitely get another just like it
also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek 5881s for jj 6l6gcs
this amp is packed with features
60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic dunlop pick
for instance the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright
i had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short
i wish there was a fine pivotangle adjustment to orient harp to mouth
then i went to daddario strings
it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar
it shipped in an envelop
seems like it works just as described
i prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord
im not crazy about the plastic casing but it seems sturdy enough
it sounds incredible and at this price its unbeatable
you wont be disappointed at all
for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat
just love this little amp
why do they charge so much
its very hard with room temp 70f
we recorded in 4ch mode with two extra mics
is just perfect for what is made for
i would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel
these cables are sturdy and sound clean
the only thing missing is a remote
in a church setting this is obviously not an option
for me and my son it works great
recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all
ive bought an additional two since my initial purchase
one volume knob one tone and one distortion knob
cant hold tightly on 1st string low c a little buzz
the people who hear us only hear us through their ears
so i tried these and they seem to hold up better
ive always tuned my ukuleles by ear
behringers tm300 is made from tough plastic
i bought this to tune my 12string without using the end jack
ill order another set for my other chibson
as far as longevity and durability time will tell
the cord is reliable and clean sounding
made in the usa to boot
your situation might be different than mine
gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer
it hasnt failed him yet
and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal
as far as a cv controler
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
i also didnt want a modeler impersonating a tube
what is it they say in this era  caveat emptor
helps my guitar stay in tune
works great especially for the price
they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings
why is it even there
what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen
then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow
holds my les paul and feels secure
that may not be enough for some but works great with my studio mike
trust me your money is best spent elsewhere
very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best idea
these are the only ones i buy now
good tone though does the trick trick
the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar
they arent rough textured so they are easier on the fingers
i was very disappointed when i tried this thing
the leather is tough and will last for years
fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great
unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this
almost no effect provided by pedal
keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lintfree cloths
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice
it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it
feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever
i was also hoping that it played well
this little gadget does the trick
the chrome on the sides looks very cool
who cares if it is plastic
far better than any light weight chrome stand this has guts
i bought this stand to mic a kick drum
the shortcomings were huge but the convenience meant that they were tolerated
leds make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range
the perfect accessory for the stage or studio
the best tuner for your board in my opinion
your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings
anyway that is the view from where i sit
i keep one at home and just ordered another one for school
i shouldve just got this cable the first time
you will hear the difference and they dont wear out like plastic
amps are pushing itplus a gig bag and school back pack
this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries
very nice guitar picks for the very fair price
the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation
i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar
my old cable was stiff and unruly
perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size
i really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware
vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers
went to a local music store heard and was sold
steel will wear down your frets a lot faster
shipping was free it arrived in under 1 week from ordering
you have to install the battery which is no big deal
seems solid and well built
i have used daddarios since my earliest playing days
padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable
i buy this cable for my dj system and work great
the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged
yes it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants
i bought this capo for mywashburn d10
bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding
yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue
relatively transparent and controls are responsive
fits nice and made well
ive used three with no trouble
for the most part this is a well builtdurable gig bag
get the 28 strand for a thicker snap
all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning
fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant
i dont have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers
my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand
easy installation and nice natural sound
easy to read and for the very low price a great value
never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers
the sound of the ukulele is great
nothing but chinese crap for sale anymore
unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my sennheisers
ive had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos
build quality 45i did have 1 problem with the high e tuner
the only 34fender34 ill ever be able to afford
it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design
they are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them
theres nothing rinky dink about it
nothing bad to say about this strap
i figured id buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal
make a note it is not a metal pedal
its easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician
you cant beat the price for such a great little tuner
it hums crackles and i think im having problems with my equipment
im more than 20 years of playing guitar
i moved the slider up and bang it worked
its small barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back
this is a great capo from shubb
analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy
however recording a choir or something would work
if you need cables these work great
mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark
the characteristic strat sound of my guitar is very apparent
i think every guitarist and bass player should own one
is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue
you cant beat the price
his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use
do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with
besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars
this is where the balance control is very helpful
it works perfect with cakewalk music creator 5 and a digitech vocalist
the mixer arrived early which was a lifesaver
for under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain
these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use
its quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument
it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those
fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med
good idea to keep more than one of these around
microphones cables straps tuner etc
the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that visegrips work
the ukelele   the ukelele looks and feels decent
excellent product from a fantastic seller
the 65 deluxe model sounds better with the 57 deluxes cab and vice versa
my next one will be an sm58 but that will be awhile from now
i honestly dont see the purpose
whats not to  love inexpensive and does its job
nice and stable easy to change strings and lock tightly
bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions
but no issues besides that
ive been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin
a peghole reamer might have done a better job but i didnt have one
but that goes for all neck racks really
they fit they work they are quiet and they wont make your life miserable
i could carry on forever but you get the idea
i often use my electric guitar unplugged
round and flat wound strings
it will probably outlast the guitar
so this item is three tools in one
this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap
mics are like pants you have to find the right fit
this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished
i already own two and had no problems
not sure if it did improve my sound or not
i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by
for the money i am not mad i tried it
the ampjack is chromemetal backplated to the body its not coming loose
the negatives and why i cant recommend it are as follows
problaly exist betters pedals but its produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything
each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply
took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and restring the guitar
i will not buy more
i bought anew bow for 62100 so
tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want
the auxillary jack is also a great addition
this is just like any other microphone stand
if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is
which is not a bad thing if thats what you are looking for
i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space
these do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior
they do the job well
it seems to work okay for that
this pedal covers the 34white room34 by cream tone perfectly
merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix
it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components
pluck a string and tune it to the dial and eureka
not to mention the bargain basement price
the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins
and purchased a license for reaper
typical of quality control in the peoples republic of china
awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop ab
does not scratch guitars finish just be careful and no issues
my budget must be tripled at least
clean really good of prints and smell very nice
it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules
i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below
best mike for the price and purpose
they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with
the metronome feature is also a nice addition
came in time worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic
all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for
this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices
remember this is overdrive  not distortion
not a sufficient defect to return the instrument
if you can pick one up used like i did all the better
almost sounds like a bad recording
i am confused by this hellish portal of confusion
knobs work well and the stand doesnt slip
thats all there is to say about it
im glad i purchased this when i did
they always give me consistent results
but this definitely has that problem
depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes
got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin
made of leather or highquality pleather so it seems builttolast
i think ive found how lazy i am
you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders
try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid
im partial to the chorus
never fear you need to see this film
a 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the back
it has some other advanced features but i havent need them
theyre the cheesiest looking leather ive ever seen
i am looking forward to using more of the effects
so far i am very impressed
the strings keep their tone for a long time
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
it gives me the portability i needed to move about my house
i figure 12 dozen will last me for years
im not sure why but it is very frustrating
i think these are great for the price they give you
the sting cutter works well
i also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly
i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years
i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2
and drive another speaker cabinet which bugera also makes
wow what a construction its got there
always great products and always dependable
i am quite pleased with this product
he used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results
i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just cant compete
i bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price
in addition to all the other fx too
its kind of an 34empty34 sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects
i just wasted away 40 something bucks add shipping
if not break out your philips head  tweak your intonation
blame the moron who knocked over your guitar
i have several brands some more expensive but i always come back to gls
unfortunately the top end isnt as defined as a at2035 or nt1a
fender makes good cheap ones
you cant beat the price
nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive
with fretted basses id always liked strings with a little brassiness
this is a decent pop filter
it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping
the purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2
i installed this in a super champ x2
im very happy with this pg58
i became relatively skilled at it in short time
each band is hyper sensitive
i got the brady bunch musical here
i know silly but i was not paying attention
another tip   get a copy of yamahas sound reinforcement handbook
if you want to spice up your board go for some color
one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals
adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter
tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides
he would definitely purchase this product
you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think
perfect to try different sizes and shapes
good product for a good price very comfortable
cheap and easy to use cant beat these picks
its working for me ill be buying more for our studio
not too hard not too soft
it worked once when i originally set it then kaput
ive noticed it works better with some daws than others also
but its a nice design and thank you to the designer
well i must say this thing rocks
good cheap mic cover fits es57 ok could be a bit tighter i suppose
i would recommend these to anyone both experienced players and amateurs alike
again my bloody experience taught me that
you also still might need your other fx
happy to have black connectors on an xlr cable that doesnt cost a ton
and theres a reason for that it isnt
when i buy a new guitar i get new locks
it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent  dirt but thats it
the strings last a long time in my opinion
will defiantly be buying more
for the price i dont see how you can beat this pedal
it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick
the spring is tough and it holds securely
they are the only ones i trust
ive tried some usb sound cards without success
recording from the internal mics seems to work fine
i play professionaly and this is the best thing ive gotten in two years
theres also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level
i always keep a lot of these on hand
its choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me
this is a well made low noise and low cost cable
i will edit in the future if necessary
june 2014 update the mini has become my preferred goto electric
why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately
btw i am a verified purchaser just cant say enough good about this cable
like they were custom made for your guitar
the strap is about 6 too short for my seagull s6 guitar
there is a rich toney presence to these springs
i thought it was awesome until i learned better
some people complained that the handle doesnt work
outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time
slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable
fast delivery and exactly as advertised
the quality doesnt suck so dont worry about
i noticed the difference on guitar
however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build
but you may want the rack version for those applications
it would just be nice if it included one is all
i no longer use heavier strings like i use too
however it doesnt even show up in the product picture on amazon
this mic is absolutely awesome
5 feet same as 6 inches right
i read the reviews on ernie ball strings
hands down the best pick ive used
its great to have sustain again on my keyboard again
i finally got it and saw how great it is
the daddario sets are good stuff
it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open
i love this tuner so much
it sounded just as good as those other amps
i immediately noticed a difference in the warmth articulation and fullness of my sound
okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic
if you have a standard size guitar neck dont bother with that
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
i have used the mxl 007
this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply
like i said for the price you cant beat it
purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home
provides good stability and displays guitar nicely
i turn fx off and on
if the behringer dies its going in the trash and ill buy another one
there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing
maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes
i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice
ive used elixirs for about five years now
i just ordered another skb fender case
very cool gadget and well executed
the reproduction of the sound was very good
the quality of the nickel is very good too
not all uke players use straps some do and some dont
i lost like 3 already but hey theres more
this does the job perfectly
it is very mobile easily adjustable sturdy and durable
those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion
im very pleased with the product and the price
plus it is extremely low priced
acoustic and elixir electric strings as well
10 but the led doesn8217t lie and it confirmed
power to the pedals rock on
this is a very serviceable strap at a great price
just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me
ive got a bunch of these little tuners i keep one with each instrument
been using the snark tuners for while now
its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass
tone control didnt work so it was returned
i dont know which one is more accurate
i dont use a long delay time in fact i dont max it out
makes a great little practice amp
it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows7 computer
they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands
debatable  clip mechanism  not spring loaded
i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else
made by daddario the quality lives up to the brand
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
it is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse
the leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary
its that good for what it does
i needed something with eq on it as well
these flatwounds were a perfect choice
amazon is great to deal with
but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses
on vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you
simple to use compact and well built
but im not certain these last so much longer
super excellent for dimly lighted rooms
additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door
great product and one that i will continue to use
this pickup sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically
the usb cable is just a type b port
simply it does what its supposed to do for a low price
for the price this is totally worth it
its a pop filter it works well and does the job
i recommend this capo to anyone
so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar
i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this
the crisp and solid vibration is just top notch
i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim
maybe they corrected the problem if one exited
this thing just screams for solos and is very heavy for rhythm
ive been a musician for over 40 years
cheap so no big loss
i ordered black but got brown
i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price
but the hard wedgie is the clear winner
i have a friend who also experienced the same problem
at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months
so it was time to get a real wah
i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material
i just requested a returnexchange from amazon
ive got another one on one of my banjos
so far the so good used for almost a month now
so someone messed up in quality control
its so dim i can barley see the reading when i squint
its really flexible on how youre planning to put on top of it
solid four stars despite me personal opinion
i would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun
i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over
mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit
i recommend it as a well functioning stand at a very economical price
also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays
since the headset has a monomicrophone this adapter works great
it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings
these mic stands worked perfectly
i found that i had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal
i bought a few for different basses and guitars
the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well  it delivers massive fuzzplussustain
ive used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting
i know that pick choosing is a personal matter
three big ones are the jet sound choralflange and leslie speaker
the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine
the range of adjustability is excellent
now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners
much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned
christmas carols are lovely but spanish stuff doesnt sound so great imho
the list goes on but i think you get the point
youll only want the cover and footswitch if youre playing in a band
it is a fuzz pedal
also i like having the middle green led for tuning
the 2nd one works flawlessly
now the bad  the sound
i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one
the shipping was incredibly fast too as always with amazon
i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events
price cant be beat either
ive had several sets for 13 years and use them without hesitation
i really believe in these strings
it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune
i use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg
the micro adjuster is easy to adjust
they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise
and they tune with amazing accuracy
fifth comes with an ac adapter
i have been using these strings for a while now
i was impressed at how much of is isnt plastic
i personally wouldnt give a nickel for them
tusq saddles and nuts are the best synthetic out there
can take some fiddling to overcome it
no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning
after twisting on it twice i stripped it out
a bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good
i am extremely impressed with this great guitar
so i recommend them but be aware of its limitations
mainly due to the low cost
digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible
the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb 11
these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors
tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results
distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards
all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it
for this much i have no complaints
but this one is just fine
overall good strings good sound  this set simply didnt last very long
great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house
then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case
it looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas
anyways i buy it from amazon and the packaging is great
i am so glad i did
so i agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid
not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars
this is a great product at a good price
its just about deadon with my korg which is extremely accurate
it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights
very cheaply made but does the job
recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar
works well to keep finger prints off
i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance
has a great sound in my opinion
average to 3 i guess
other than the above excellent pedal
the build quality is fantastic
the celluloid ones come two per size
still i needed a distortion that could cover of the marshall soundlike roar jcm800
sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on
everything i have seems to be jet black
other than that they appear ok
the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life
so we kind of wove it above some and under others
i dont see how it could be better
had no issues in the 2 months
whats not to love about these strings
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
it pretty much does what its supposed to
to my ears it sounds quite good
its a very solid fairly large item made of heavy cast metal
i accidently bought large ooh boy is it like windshield sun reflector size
i can buy an adapter with onoff switch for microphone
the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure
your used to using big picks which strum hard easily
there is some noise but i dont attribute that just to the power supply
thats exactly what i wanted from a desk stand
for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality
pros  great price very loud as well as clear
for 25 bucks i dont think you can beat it
the dorky pad around the handle
this does work as described
just squeeze and slide it where you need it
nice product i suggest it
i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand
one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ
these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most
no matter for me since all i use is the tuner anyway
still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool
you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase
and on the downside made in china
all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand
it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel
the quality is good the smell was funny when first opened
this stand is basically dead weight
the capos well made and doesnt show any manufacturing flaws at all
buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone
it gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone
i love the luster and shine of new strings feels nice ans springy
i would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal
and not waste of money or an unwanted item
a must for every serious guitar player
dont recall if i purchased it on amazon
for the price they can not be beat
the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volumewah 2in1 pedal
i would not get these again in this size
installation is not rocket science
easy to set and adjust while playing live and onthefly
i couldnt get it to sound like i wanted it to
i am still searching for the worlds perfect allpurpose pick
they dont vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they dont need as much clearance
used them while building a few prewired pick guards
quick release around the neck strap system
like i said the build quality is outstanding
shouldnt they have a 599 one for 5string bass guitars
wish i would have known about it sooner
i think ill be putting one of these on most instruments from now on
this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension
my piece arrived in a week thank you very much
and they sent a case
you could do something similar on the x3live
then a volume knob a tone knob and thats it
as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it
hi i need this item for travelling and it has work very well
unlike my steel string capo this uses a screwknob to tighten not spring loaded
they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great
the fret does not have any issue at all
it could be less dense i think
firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip
most work by using a small builtin microphone that picks up sound waves
but you can do it
good price and works well
ive given it a 3 star merely out of respect for hohner
so for the price you really get far more than you pay for
i dont know how long it will last
i was an ernie ball guy for a long time
neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp
thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric
its not multihundred dollar instrument but for kids and beginners its a good deal
im happy with the reults my 40 got me
the corners of the case are well reinforced
i have finally learned my lesson
these just did not perform as expected
wouldnt even think twice about it
these cables are solidly made affordable and really easy to differentiate on a mixer
but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong
i use it with boss and ibanez pedals and it works great
use at your own risk
this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack
this was a great addition to our studio here at
nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body
use this alot on all kinds of electronics
i have not used them for a regular guitar
i am using it for a dj karaoke system i do recommend it
material is rougherbut thats a good thing
the shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order
ukulele straps are a rare thing and ive yet to find the perfect one
its pretty without distracting from the guitar itself
there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short
9 million pounds and no casters
they come in three colors and the colors stand for soft medium hard
i am thankful that i did not have any of said cracks or chips
the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson
very sturdy and very well made
i always use martin on any acoustic
also they werent as large as i expected
i just dont know what kind of liquid to use
pretty cool knockoff of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo
an hour later guess what
maybe some lock tight would help
goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface
i do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic
not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place
it doesnt sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine
the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable
i used this with my planet waves 9v adapter
and the vox is 4w while the bugera boasts 5w
i say why pay more
this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings
heres the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender
works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
for 30 bucks this thing does the job
are there better locks out there
feels pretty durable im sure it will last quite a while
i got this after seeing many of my church friends using them
does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it
the foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals
who said learning the guitar was difficult
no slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwards
this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system
this new ns triaction capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively
you simply play faster no matter what level you are
a snug fit for the pod hd 500
just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job
youll like this stuff better than anything youve used to date
i like the tone of daddarios 8020 bronze strings
still a relatively short amount of time
the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated
so save your dough buy any color but red
these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with
much better than the more economical ones sold
i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation
for that purpose these are made well
the ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way
after stringing them up  tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded
this is a very good cable
the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short
it also has a lifetime guarantee
dropped the action back down and its smooth as silk in an hours time
always looking for reasonable pricing
it also works great for a guitar
they made it sound even better than it was
i have a mustang iii and it gets destroyed by the zt
get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun
so it was something that was necessary
youd best be served with dot stickers
these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock
perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets
i love how they sound and they are built well
better than the nady starpower mic i also bought from amazon
they may wind up damaging their guitar
im pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years
even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online
i just cannot get any octave sounds idk am i missing something
you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher
thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of five
the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light
one is its height adjustable and two is the tilting head
definitely a 5 star purchase
apparently they arent easy to make
another great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v18v
oh did i mention this is a very good looking guitar
and inside that was my lovely new guitar
you cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal
the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal
great grip slow wearing and they dont break
dont know if their qc has gone downhill or what
later saw this one and decided to try it
only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds
at lt20 this is a great bargain but it is a very basic bag
works fine with any guitar
i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful
i guess all my other cases just dont measure up to this one
both ended up in checked luggage
but if youre not too picky this will suit you very well
the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance
for me these lightmedium are exactly where i want my strings to be
still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing
well built easy setup very quiet
these are nice and bright
and the sound expanded beyond my expectations
i am buying more gauges too
i used to buy all shure productsim switching to gls
they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking
just what i have expected
tried other more expensive capos but this one is the winner
the only problem is the size
the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar
i know is plastic but
this is the neatest little light i have ever seen
it fit my american vintage 70s strat
the case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy
the cable came in the time it was promised
this is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed
ive been so impressed by epiphones but this one didnt do it
see the picture and youll understand how it works
and it did the same with a usb phone
this drop clutch is just fantastic
and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces
well the hunt is over
i just got this uke today
remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp
i am a tech as well as a guitar player
other than a great display and accurate tuning
the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides
always buy daddario strings for my 7 guitars
ill get another cr if this one holds up okay
i got this pedal recently
personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103
plus the battery life is great
it also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose
overall for this price you cant go wrong
but thats a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument
havent played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes
i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all
this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly
it came in nice packaging
if youre looking for some good trs cables
i bought this strap for a esp ec1000 les paul style guitar
ill probably stick with extra light for awhile
volume pedal you need to use an effect bank
good for the price and no regrets
it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make
make sure you have a good microphone to use with it
in summary 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service
its the most delicate amp ive owned
check out the video reviews by the userscompanies goldhat3 samashmusic giggear and shadowfw
for the price its a must have
ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound
i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception 220 microphone
great for videophoto work or even theater
none has ever failed me so far
i also like the tone a lot
this one works fine so far
i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar
the best look and performance on a fender guitar
guitar pics as the gods of rock intended
i had zero noise level using these cords
it definitely doesnt add any more fatness
it is my first condenser mic and at 149 it is a steal
i hope that doesnt happen with an adapter
it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range
this strap is very long if you need it to be
this guitar is extremely well made and put together right
i will update this review when i have that information
i see mixed reviews here
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel correctly
some sheetsstand units cost 50
so why have i never tried their egit strings
make sure you order the right size
the original speakers are too hifi sounding for me
this is not true bypass but neither is the boss
it also has a different switch than the sm58
i had an old wallwart laying around and put it to good use
this acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever
this is an exemplary capo
i bought it myself as a kind of experiment
simple light and does what its suppose to
my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs
not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund
i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box
you will not be sorry with this purchase
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved
its the third color of the same pick i purchased
ive got hours if i chose to
one was an ev and the other a rather costly older peavey
i purchased some others to try
this product is straight forward and works as its intended
i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily
seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt
i like these nickel on my tele
seems really sturdy and well made
this works very well for all of them
thanks to amazon for the quick service
it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away
this capo however just works simply smoothly and its a great pleasure to operate
great precise tuning with the sn2 versus the other snark versions
i like the extra heavy picks
awesome feel sound and price
i used to buy leather straps but not any more
the plastic housing is extremely strong and wont bust when used properly
man am i glad i did
it is not something you are going to understand at first
the strings are true to elixirs quality and tone
i put it on my stratstyle guitar and it works brilliantly
just put in a 9v battery and it works right away
i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments
i have the snark 2 but read that this was the best so far
this is a handy little contraption
hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off
or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it
i really did not expect much from this rag
sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother
a great investment unless you have a perfect ear
you dont know how good youve got it
what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device
but their intended purpose is to speed string changes
it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too
i have experimented with others but always come back to them
always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm
its built like a tank
to keep your guitar looking and sounding great
thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasnt very happy
at these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments
may be  the age thing
it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time
mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up
this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours
just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings
3 find a converter from barrel jack to 35mm jack
it is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price
i like it enough that i bought another one
but do consider you means of mounting carefully
my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case
the product itself is excellent
so far the behringer uca 222 is working great
first i want to make clear that this is a dark bassy pedal
i had signal loss using these cables
i was tuning in a dimlit room and was able to read it perfectly
i dont expect any problems
my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent
not a bad price either
you can do it yourself so easily
the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference
i thought this pedal would do the trick
besides that the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic
i am only using for lightweight applications
so far it does some good things but it could be much better
maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb
im switching to the planet triaction
so give them a try
for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these daddario strings
all this and a secret compartment for picks
if you are careful it offers good protection
using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks
thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping
tried others but i prefer these
4 stars is my tops anywhere
disappointing was looking for to receiving these
the name says it all
the term stomp box isnt supposed to be taken literally
it proudly states the guitars origin of corona
worked out of the package and was cheap
i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it
but with the string and bone upgrades i cant imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass
the fab overdrive pedal does not work well for me
my go to capo for years
i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel  correctly
no pedal including a 200 boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies
this little box is great for metronome use
this strings have good sound and hold a tune well
they are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders
but based on my experience i dont recommend this one
i couldnt be happier with these items especially the ovation idea
it picks up every smudge smear  print and leaves nothing behind
these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings
for under twenty dollars this pylepro mike cant be beat
i use it for guitarvoice solo live internet music shows
i dont know if thats still the case
works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from amazon
i will definitely be washing my hand right after using it
i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome
they turned out to be just right
i thought i had found my pick
for the  should be more dependable
it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well
its less than ten bucks
i wouldnt say its agreat instrument but way more than i expected for 60
that said this thing is rock solid
it will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs
you get what you pay for
enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves
im going to get another one before they decide to raise the price
i used it and i like it
absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and smallevent purposes
i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster
the digital reverb has a spacious feel
havent used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected
if not just invest about 6 into an adapter like i did
too loose and deep so i increased the setting to 3 and repeated
cant even tell if it is on or off
its not bad if you want a uke but its pretty small
be forewarned  this pedal is gigantic in dimension
i havent fooled with the other features metronome
the quality of it is above my expectations
it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it
not my first intellitouch tuner
this is a cheaper alternative to the 34string swing34 wall mount considerably less expensive
strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle
the strings are well made and ive never had an issue with quality
before we get started i am more pro than amateur
work perfectly with my guitar good price
so make sure you try before you buy
last distortion pedal youll ever need
perfect retrofit for my 1989 american strat
what else is there to say
durable affordable easy to grasp and use
just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting
great price and should last long enough
it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch
this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance
i like it but im just playing for entertainment and at church some times
ive used several different kinds of strings over several years playing
i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect
worked perfectly for my latest guitar project
i needed it for nothing else so im happy
with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood
but well packaged and arrived on time
it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced
i have not found that to be true
very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer
the thing is quick and accurate
at home or on the go i cant see the need for another tuner
for the price and product quality you cant go wrong with this one
thanks guys will be shopping with you again
great strings an industry standard at a great price whats nor to love
i rate them excellent in that category
well what can i say
they destroy luggage so i dont think it would fair well
the color is darker than pictured on amazon  black powder coating
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low
i would buy this again
worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose
the hohner special 20 just seems to have this little extra
i use fender 150ls and with it the longevity doubles
for under 200 im amazed at how nice this guitar is
my goto string brand for any stringed instrument
idk what mics use that but is something to note
i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup
i have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite
good because itll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles
i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron
works perfectly for me it does got a nice made
the bullet is nice but i outgrew it
very useful when restringing a guitar
doesnt sound good playing fast
daddarios are top quality and very reasonably priced
this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused
response and visual display are awesome
used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin
no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery
these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive
bb is displayed as a
it looks really good sturdy and well made
5 feet is a weird length for a cable
amazon was great in conjunction with the seller
three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility
this unit is well constructed
i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me
i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future
heavy duty but soft on the shoulder
then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation
goes to show how diverse they are
the rest will just play as if the effect was off
simple and easy to use easy to carry around
ive heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results
be sure to get a pop filter to go with it
i told him i would just get another
it sounds really good on my classical guitar
they work well for that
it restored the soundpower and clearity of my amps
nice and snug with my american stage cables daddario is great
first off im a big fan of daddario strings and their planet waves division
i said all that bc i dont want to come off as condescending
they made my cv50s sound fuller with greater sustain
i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them
if youre really an acoustic guitar aficionado youll want to try these
worth the money great product
im planning to keep it for years
its nice and easy to use
this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china
the unit i received did not work
tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs
switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot
it did fit my kala katg with room to spare
the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast
i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment
i really like the mediums
and at 5 why wouldnt you give them a shot
highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost
it doesnt hold very many picks but it really doesnt have to
i really cant complain about anything
i use the green 88mm picks and also the orange 60mm ones
it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar
anyway  no reservations about this one
what a great little gizmo
this cable is an amazing find
and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway
if you own more than 1 pedal and we all do you need this
ive had it just over a month so amazon wont help me
that being said this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi
it also came with a cord
all in all it was worth the money
the product is here and i am glad the size is right
i would buy this again
i would not advise anybody to get this
fresh strings do sound better
i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat
had another brand that stopped working and replaced with this
he loves to play his bass and sing along
because from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose
it should not be a problem to you or your guitar
which is how it can run up to 8 pedals
its so similar i contacted daddario to ask them what the difference was
even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy
this guitar just got stolen from me
at that price its an amazingly good deal
think the jimi blues cd
action is adequate for practicewith a little tweaking its actually good
its like any other snark super tight tuner
from the audacity web site
accurate or inaccurate not good or bad theres a difference
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage
i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed
this is a highly featurefull amp at this price point
works very well with no problems
this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough
i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes
i have used coins and washers at times
and for every job there is the right tool
this is a sturdy case that looks good too
at orange county and amazon
and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner
these are great strings for such a rare instrument
i wish i had found this amp sooner
this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset
so in short id buy it again
the only problem i had is voltage
i believe ive rated this instrument before
very responsive very clean sounding
when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner
and they just plain feel good to use
it is perfect to me
first of all it is a beauty
comes with big beefy drywall anchors and feels just right
monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price
i love waxing my guitars
i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural
as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that
that last one was far far better than the first two
very solid build never felt cheap in any way
it works awesome with electric guitar too
overall a reasonable value and im glad i bought it
if youre looking for massive distortion keep looking
it does the perfect job for podcasting as well as gameplay videos
although i play guitar i find the other side of the wheel less helpful
the tone feel and bend is whats important
for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet
none of them work as good as i would like
i prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway
also note i play with the rounded edge not the tip
good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length
zzounds musicians friend sweetwater music 123 dont buy from them
i might have to sell one of my lexuses
good design easy to hang on to these picks
they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff
they arrived before the promised delivery date
it is difficult to use in a small apartment  too loud
but the more i use it the better feel i get for it
the dava changes that for me
it really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar
it links well with other pedals
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic
want a really good china
i have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder
when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck
gibson les paul with bigsby
not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob
it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them
this seems like a good deal for the price
i have all the volume i need and great tone
they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck
this is a simple elegant strap that inspires envy
heavy duty base lots of adjustment if needed
and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i havent tried yet
the effect isnt as noticeable on darker finishes though
inside of the box it came with 2 screw sizes
i like the martin coated as well but i prefer the elixer
the strings dont break either
this is too loud for most apt
battery life appears to be adequate
good for acoustic and electric guitars
ive even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype
and the medium light set is just perfect
this is not one of those
about as sturdy as a tripod can be
i love being able to adjust the tension
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
add 6 picks and start rockin
holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you
these are good replacements or upgrades
i found the screwon connector to not be that high quality
sound nice but very unreliable bx5a deluxe
i usually use it as a midboost for solos
one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place
theres a great video on yt from proguitarshopcom that demos it very well
but no room to spare
hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and youre set
this baby is worth every penny and i highly recommend it to any guitarist
this stand is great for my 45lb peavey 1500
it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive
if you like being in tune this is probably for you
like others though i cant stop playing through this
let me first start off with the sizing
works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power
this one works almost like a mist
i can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke i want inside
not recommended for band environments
73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick
i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them
it works great thank you nady and amazon
if i purchase another strat i will purchase this case again
im going to get a squier strat instead with either amapleorrosewoodneck
for 2400 this compressor does just what its supposed to do
well padded lots of good pockets does all that it should
whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out
might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers
i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge
i bought the ebony with pearly inlay
make your axe shine and look like a rockstar
the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use
its pretty basic but really good for a beginner
great idea great concept and great quality
but for me these work just fine
the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects
it goes from slapback to space shot very easily
the 3pack is a fantastic deal
the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too
if you like the design go for it
finish stitching and adjustments are quality
makes me feel good inside to look at it
already ordered a different one to replace it
the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable
you really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit
i cant find a single complain about this amp
i cant say if they last longer vine has us review this asap
these did the trick fine
works if you keep it with instrument in your case and upkeep is minimal
i searched on amazon for a banjo strap and this came up
recommended to one and all
these have pegs that insert
my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic
the colours help with organization
too bad as i had high hopes
the seat is very soft and comfortable
its a cool pedal especially considering its price but dont be fooled
but were talking 1000 tube amps
dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part
i recently purchased a replacement the sn8b but found it really disappointing
purchased this and a comparable hosa cable
it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board
operates with one 3v 2032 battery included
it hasnt seen heavy use
i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings
holds the strings down perfectly too great capo
a decent little 34sized traveler
the alpha is a great little interface
ive been using this brand of strings for years
you disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods
i think ill tend to use this one a lot more than the other
repeating the process yielded identical results
it can do subtle lowrate lowdepth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles
as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years
this is the best case ever for the money
boss is the company that dominates my effects board
i have become a fan of gls
a friend gave me a few of these and overall i like them
these went on with no problems
admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then arent all mic evaluations subjective
the amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings fuzz twang etc
i like the super slinks as well
aside from the passive electronics
for 10 bucks its a great piece
its a classic guitar it shouldnt have had steel strings to begin with
it has a nice color throw too
whats funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge
there are several reviews of this product on you tube
plays 34dead34 meaning it will not stay intune
i loved it right out of the box
things i dont like much 1
it makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy
everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm
of course there are plenty of other choices for that application
i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget
amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc
it is a cutaway design without electronics
i feel like it is a bargain at any price
the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest
i have several and a snark for each one
this is one great looking cable
these are my favorite strings for electric guitar
from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only 40
how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable
also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me
certainly do not get the rc 2
i ordered a couple from my guitar seller
the system is a secure locking system
but i think thats the best light to shine on this one
i am happy with the quality of all of them
i plan on buying him another set of them for christmas
his old one lasted about 10 years
i replaced it with  mini modtone type delay
i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model
everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it
this one is a keeper
theyre also quite good on les paul style guitars if you like slinky strings
i plugged the guitar to my old crate amp and it sounded pretty good
the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced
overall they are just not as good
i use to use a cloth to clean my strings
i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly
youll need a new one about every ten years or so
the average price now is 15 and over
cheap case but does at least fit the guitar
i carry a backup pedal
this polish works well for what i need it for
this needs to be plugged directly into a computer
i am now on my second set of strings and i am hooked
from simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all
they complement my washburns very well
i either use the 9s or the 10s and detune them
i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family
to my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum
most people dont use chorus and flange at the same time anyway
i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge
the absolute best guitar stand made
i have two complaints about it though
i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp
anyone needs string go for it
overall i like it and its certainly worth the minimal price
fuller sound with the 1046s buti cannot bend them like the 9s
lots of bang for the buck here
the shielding was great as well
i like the multiple display options and calibrations
the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it
it was worth the wait
it came today like the computer said it would
this is an excellent product
3 the jam has a gain meter ie an led and a gain control
this one serves the bill
i use these on an old gibson semihollow body
they look nice and do the job perfectly well
one is an inline tuner one built into my amp
the bag is well made considering its price
im a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldnt have this problem
i am very pleased with the price and the quality
it could be used on just about any instrument
will do the job until you find the one of your dreams
which is why im buying another half dozen
otherwise its well built and works
the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use
is easy on the plating and very gentle
it seems to be manufactured well
i just learned last night how to coil them up
maybe its just a matter of finding the right place to put it
ive had similar problems with other pyle products
i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars
so ive become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar
i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen
easily adjustible knobs tighten easily and firmly
i like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it
edit  im nothing if not fair
if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava
how much can you say about a patch cable
they are not too stiff nor are they too soft
they are quick to release and adjust and fit very well
it really nice made in canada not china wow
its not a big deal
thats what you do at home and its called practice for a reason
dropped one a few times and its still working
they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new
they tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders
weve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job
they are larger than i expected and rather thick
these daddario exl110 strings are light responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great
you cant go wrong with a brand name like shure
affordable technology in the service of great art
i would recommend it or purchase again
the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well
its a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing
well made proven over decades
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
well worth the small price paid
its very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap ive ever had
i figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too
it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time
if you dont want anything heavy this is good for you
if it were under 7 it would have gotten 5 stars
so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality
this mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instruments
its pretty hard to mess these up
i do a lot of recording  i also checked the sound after recording
i have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great
after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved
good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery
did try to install software on a pc with vista no luck
its easy to put on and holds the strings well
pluck a string and it will indicate what it is
switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck
the tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great
i wanted a third guitar just for kicks
though it will gouge your floor
i find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber
crystal clear and it doesnt color the recordings
they glisten when he uses this to polish them
the ditto is so easy
then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub
the good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them
i needed some little easy and portable guitar stands for the stage
the springs are almost always missing
light takes up little space and easy to use
you will not be disappointed
for an 8 item you cant go wrong
i strayed briefly on a fender smart capo
the nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear
the soprano one fits great even though its a different brand
id say the effects are just soso
this is not a great quality microphone
find a youtube video to see all of its potential
for the price i am very pleased
over the years ive tried several different brands of string
ive used ernie balls slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades
this wah pedal just doesnt cut it
after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument
the guitar has good tone and action
you dont bend your finger to play slide
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
again 8020s are recommended for mahogany guitars
got the mics from dealer fast
all in all be patient and all will be well
this one is too slow for the stage
and the price aint so bad either
it works and does at it is supposed to
of course hohner has been around longer than me
the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom
they sound wonderful and cost very little
i would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet
it doesnt seem to affect the playability
these tuners are just awesome
so what is the difference between the 235 and the 535
i bought him a set of these
so i figured an experiment was in order
this stand is a little difficult to open
set echo for multiple head repeats
88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues
i have had and tried about every compressor out there
i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this
holds 810 picks depending on thickness
excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity
this is one of the best mics in this price range
however it doesnt appear to hold anyone with excess weight
at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price
finally do not drop these
i use it with a vht special 6
if you set it at 10 or 11 oclock its plenty loud enough
but on this profx8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up
was easy for my husband to use
playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking
white thin picks by fender what else can i say
the stand is worth the price and more
id buy this again in a heartbeat
but is a good product
but as a backup stand i wouldnt hesitate
may buy one for my dad next
not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some
i dont really notice a difference when i use different cables
more than my other guitars again not a pro
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive
it is a very nice strap and will last years
i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it
this product works the way it should be
these things are heavy duty and thick
simply put its well made and works great
i didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good
this is a nice leather strap not thick but very functional and nice looking
dont get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should
i would definately buy more
that doesnt make this valueless
it works great though and for the price its wonderful
mxr is by far better then boss imho and i do love my dd3
i re soak it easy 23 weeks or so
ive got several guitars and capos  this one is not too bad
great bag well padded the shoulder strap is nice
seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick
but if you follow the darker side keep looking
i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine
but i have to say its well worth the price
this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass
never had one bad set out of over a hundred
my only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough
size hands i find its a good fit
for a long time i never thought much about guitar strings
next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay
it is a euro stand so it has 5827 threads
they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers
this cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp
its also perfect for adding vocal effects to small barebones pa systems
first a word about joyo
go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered
the sound quality is great
if i would have paid 20 on this strap i would be furious
the cleans are warm and
too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound
i am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also
most of the popular options or 100 and up
its not the best strap in the world but its not bad
helped a lot with vibrations in my apartment building
not much else to say
nice strap for the money
the sn8 is small  unobtrusive
unless you know what youre doing these things are too small
neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop
but it is a complete kit
i cannot be sure about other brands and models
but i only use the tortex pics
i normally use my korg footswitch tuner for my guitar and basses
the tone becomes duller the output drops
maybe its my signal chain
break in quickly and hold their tune work for all styles of playing
its rugged well thought out solidly built and simple
used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo 6
a genuine fender part that looks great on my 10 mim strat
i bought 4 pcs of these at 8each shipped
sometimes it felt a little off but robots know best right
im currently using the snark on my guitar
it was brand new unopened in box
this is a very useful tuner since its small fast and pretty rugged
at full price of 1699 it is a solid deal
its 15 watts but its loud
your attitude and hands create the sound in the end
screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use
its like playing a silk guitar
so they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables
i think they perform very well for the price
not my pick at 150
can find anything better for this cheap
these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks
this was time and money well spent
the price is right for these and they work just fine
i prefer that the rings all be brass one color
works well for my guitar
this is not my first guitar
but for a small room its great
along with a few high end guitars i also have a few beaters
fit and finish is quite nice
item works as advertised very easy to hook up
its either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much
this guitar stand is as basic as you can get
i just got done stringing them and they sound great
best strap locks ive ever used dunlop has always had great products
leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars
i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it
that last 14 63mm of movement on each leg was worth 100 improvement
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item
illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
ive used shubb for years
strange for this particular usage scenario
there are gig bags and there are gig bags
the drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late
i tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail
also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle
i dont expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me
not kidding dont use those in public situations
i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should
also used these for the tremolo back cover
so really i just use this for the wire cutter feature
ive been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far
it may be the best string ever or not
also works to cut ukulele strings
i recommend this capo without reservation
i got mine for less than 20 bucks
perfect for the garage band
it worked just as it said it would
definitely not the strings though
so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum
a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar
i play lead and rhythm
this product is a must
of course guitar strings can be a personal preference
i use compressors quite a lot
i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar
i have nothing but praise for them
hence my purchase of these felt picks
update now working got my mate an aussie genius to have a look
quality of manufacture and assembly great
the pickups are really nice
great for old school rock and roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc
works great on voice overs singers and rappers
this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track
im a bass player and so i dont deal with cut picks much
works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time
so i play while im watching football or baseball
likes  size assignable knobs
thats about 58 inch thick
this interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint
you need a pa that provides 48v power to use it
never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft
i use a little finger grease spray and i would recommend them to anyone
you need a boom stand
good trees for the price
i was able to match exactly an authentic original univibe sound with some adjusting
its flawless in quality and doesnt give any feedback
they really are like a new set of strings
i am thinking about getting a 2nd one
strings are half the battle with stringed instruments
and of course they sound excellent too
otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance
if youre a metalhead stay away
i like the jim dunlop
the quality of this mic is just ok
my friends say duh oh well behringer is built cheap and is junk
as i indicated i have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol
it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really
and i feel that way about music
88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase
to boot they are extremely comfortable as well
it is very well made
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
it must be from a product like this
not sure how a nonpiezo pickup would affect the tone
i did the length first then thickness and finally the height
would and will buy again and recommend
operation is simple press once to record
in some cases ive decided something else sounded better
ive had a set before
if youre a bass player and use a pick you need one of these
john mayer and other of my favorite musicians use these strings there great
i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars
i am in the process of returning it
its comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches
this little tuner is so easy to use and see
its wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use
works well with polish on natural wood instruments
i havent figured out which yet
this is worth the investment for your expensive mic
i have it in a 63 brown deluxe and am very good with it
this little unit is packed with great effects
it is second place on my list
this tunners turned my normal cheap squier into a perfect squier
i ordered two pdmic58s and they came with an xlr to 14 cable included
i tried airing it out for a week with no success
i still recommend the mic though
one of the connections broke that is
im using the guides to replace factory guides on my strat and tele
all that said it is nice and some will love it
i used this on my last stratocaster build
this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio
edit  92212i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow
heck maybe uke players should try those too
you wont be performing with this guitar
great quality an very robust
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
its well made and works well
the tone it gives isnt bad either
the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible
it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows
if you need a tube screamer
the picks have almost zero flex to them meaning the player has solid control
this is a fantastic product that is well made
all the notesreeds sounded good
good cable and has m et all of our needs
been a fan of these for years now
i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply
easy to use with one knob
i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter
i found it really warmed up my sound in a good way
it just sounds weird and unmusical
also its cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you
are usually north of 200 which isnt practical for a casual player
not much of a chore
but for general purpose use and abuse
would i use it on stage or in the studio
i didnt think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that
my typical strings are elixirs so im used to them lasting a long time
easy to use accurate programmable lights up easy to read decent quality
over all though this is great for lightly distorted  edge of distorted sounds
clips on easily and hold strings down nicely
these locking ends are the ticket
i used to tune my guitar online
a lot of harmonics and output captured
exposing the delicate printed circuit board
i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard
i like the way they sound
im very pleased with it
it is pretty and very strong
i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster
i didnt even notice a smell
its ok but not super tight
its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle
i love all the options you get with this pedal
personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass
and no surprises works like a champ
i actually got this for my acousticelectric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it
buy if you need a stand
the effect is subtle at best
for 10 you cannot go wrong with this
it needs some force to put it into place
but i still have a 70 mic that wont work with my computer
it is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well
not the best pedal out there but for the price
im not sure how much i can say about a mute
this is a wonderful little looper
it holds about 6 to 7 picks
leaks a bit while using  so dont stand under it
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it
so minus one star for that
weight is pleasantly light and the semigloss finish is comfortable to the touch
it works got on time
plus its easy to see
it is fitted snugly and well made
it does what it is intended to do holds my picks
the price was right too
i just really like this little guy
the strap ends are great but theyre not really secure
for the price this is an excellent case
with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp
chrome is great quality and it has good weight so its not tinny
they are solid sound great and this packaging of them is excellent
primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer
this would work fine for drummers
this is my 1st gator case and im very pleased with it
hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space
worth every penny and then some
these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality
in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively
very pretty and nice quality
it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass
i like the thickness of this pick
its a great little tuner
i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price
is a great way to change the sound of your guitar
they stay in tune very nicely
this is a good product which ive seen many people use
so this was my first real tuner its very simple to use
well worth the small cost
i havent swapped tubes or the speaker  its completely stock
solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience
if it rocks the fingerboard is radiused
the cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings
i dont use distortion pedals
wow a bench that really holds my ass
this amp is perfect for me
now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it
i like on stage stuff
the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared
what if you need delay and modulation
heard they were nice strings
so i cant speak to really heavy use of the product
if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed
put our hangers in studs but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall
supposedly a new tightener design is on the way
very very loud electric guitar amp
i put these on a dual humbucker usa strat
so far still made in america
i have had no problems with them
the more overtones an instrument produces the worse the tuner behaves
i have them on my luna 12 string and the sound is rich
this is a very useful guitar compressor
i am using it with win7 64bit  sonar xl producer
i paid 97tax for my gcb95 cry baby and it was worth every penny
so much sustain for a bolt on neck
however it has not proven to be kidproof
high quality hassle free design
if you receive a lemon return it and order another
im going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it
each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand
it is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use
the bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box
this is not the case
i have to admit this up front  im a terrible bass player
want to get serious about a wah
for the money this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use
very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound
really impressed with the polyweb
you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow
muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in db
theyre all full of crap you dont need
that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost
im a cheapskate and i cant go back to cheap strings
you could say that requires two hands in order to remove it
this capo looks great and does the job
works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas
i dont have not one bad thing to say
my thick stock strings were killing my fingers
on top of it all its pretty affordable
i was a little skeptical having used other strap lock systems
the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank
tis makes it a little awkward to carry
this is the pick i learned to play with
you take the packs and put them in the sleeves
it is built sturdy and sounds really good
this powers the system without hooking it into the usb system of your computer
i would try the fender
anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all
it was easy to install and the finish was perfect
great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin
hard to believe this was so bad
no neck damage to axes
i was very surprised how well built it is
these are nice clean tubes that react consistently
it is adjustable for standing and sitting
months into using the gig bag and not a single problem
i bought a set awhile back for my ovation but never used them
in this case you can look forward to getting a great product here
the neck feels silky smooth
im definitely a fan of joyo products
i cant speak for someone with a bit smaller of a headand ears
itll do the job but i dont like it
it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt
you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks
he can create jamclick tracks and play along
the tuner is perfect for me
it picks up sound ok but not great
it took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions
the high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep
its hard to beat the quality of monster cables
once you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhere
i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items
no problems at all with this product
plays well and keeps in tune
the buzz increases in volume over time
switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal
if youre looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz this is the pedal you need
i made the r28 c11 and c12 modifications
i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast
ive used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps
the amp modelling is fantastic
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
its just really good and clear and powerful
it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter
i love the ej16 light gauge for their size and ease of use
ive been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time
i run compression wah overdrive superoverdrive delay  reverb pretty much in that order
breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response
ive always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work
or heck even just a little better
if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done
but i havent bought a guitar cable since this one
this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea
for this kind of money you cant really go wrong
and i have to say the aqua color is major retro
i bought these lightpicks because of the price
very nice clip on tuner for the price
a mono mic jack no other inputs
now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic
easy to install and remove
i got the aged white
they are a wonderful product
this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard
far as i can tell good strings
keep it right in your case
this is a great little ukulele to have around the house
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
they work and they last
well made and you cant beat the price
i decided to go cheap and got the rp255
they either work or do not
bright display easy to use works well and cheap
like the crush or roland cube it has its own voice
you can tweak the echo in 100s of different ways
if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner
4 stars seems about right
the heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well
i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune
i work with a guy who has played guitar for 30 years
set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect
who knows but it looks way cool lol
i will buy planet waves from now on
thats my only complaint about it
its nice having all of the tools on one device
not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore
they all work great and of the various models i prefer the sn2 red
all guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there
yes i spent more than i ever have on a pedal board before
and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy
in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have
it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers
just too digital and uninspiring
i have reviewed this before
i got this strap just to try something different than a nylon
im powering a zoom ms50g and a fulltone ocd
i laugh when ever i hear about the 34holy grail34 4558 ic chip
anyone who works with pa and sound equipment needs these adapters
this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts808 pedal
im not sure how 34on stage34 ready this is
no this tuner is not super tight
these are pretty good quality tweed cables
if so you can stop reading
cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist
i have never experienced a string break in 30 years
it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much
they last forever and dont rust
uses a 9v battery or 9v adaptor
other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside
i would purchase this unit again and again
maybe 5 times in my entire career
lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos
and if youre not careful it may find a permanent home
it really will produce marshall plexi tones
if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you
this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best
fantastic product that every guitar player needs  period
so i dont know if its a fair representation of these pedals
great sound and great deal
active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely
only about 4134 long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs
i dont know what i was expecting
the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes
go to my website and look for it
i bought two of these
nevertheless for what it is
i would pay the price again in a hartbeat
they are made well  last
these strings honestly arent for rhythm
if you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases
they just dont get any better than mxr
the sound is a lot more there
for 99 it is a steal
really cool looking and are nice picks for the
replaced the battery only once
sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and its okay
ill probably get used to it eventually
have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have
myself i have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall
high quality does not fray stays on the guitar
tuning then became a breeze
something i didnt consider when ordering a uke
having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere
i play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in columbus ga
it is hours and hours of fun
they sound good on a variety of models like sgles paul rickenbacker
in livepractice situations at high volumes it doesnt bother me much
first it tunes very accurately
kinda cool if you ask me
looking at the tension table daddario publishes its clear why this is the case
ive read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
i wouldnt buy another one
pluck a string and let it sit and it slowly cleans up
good replacement for iffy tuners
this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get
i bought these xlr cables for my mobile dj rig and they perform flawlessly
i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me
ive been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago
it might not be durable but it looks durable
good luck and good music to all
the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace
any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it
it is better than my intelli 600 which i also like
i got this pretty fast
this is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player
that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use
only downside is theres no neck support
they go in tune and stay in tune
my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit
look at the picture of it next to a coke can
its a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in
adjusts easily nice width comfy enough for me
i have other tuners but this one is the best
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together
i got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool
it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings
i was totally surprised that it actually works this good
this is a good solid cable with no problems
it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure
i like it a lot
it fits the guitar perfect and is easy to adjust
this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without
i recommend this capo without reservation
i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin
this capo fits so easily
i am amazed at the great sn8
comes with a decent hard case and sweet shock mount
fits fine on my cheap rogue a type mandolin
since i first got it ive rearranged once already
i also wish it was an xlr connection
easy to operate easy to read
like the pic holder on front
at first i played it with my line 6 15 watt amp
its solidly built and i dont imagine it will break easily
and the adapters never used em
so i got my full order
i certainly recommend daddario nylon strings on classical guitars
it is exactly what was described and it was a good price
long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate
this was a great investment for my home studio
most of my cables are from planet waves and ive never had an issue
theres a multiswitch for hall spring and room
the gold plating ensures a solid connection
i wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play
the unit is simple to use and the builtin microphones do a great job
im gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp
id go back to elixir next time
i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews
i am very happy with the purchase
dava 6024 grip tipitem is as advertised
i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards
the build quality is solid  it feels like a much more expensive amp
those work well for acoustic
dont worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound
i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use
looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought 2
this is my 2nd hercules stand
the included ableton live 8 lite software recognized the unit as well
for the money this mic performs very well
has more low end and a smoother mid that the ocd
but it hasnt broke yet and it might never break
more than worth it though
this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds
got mine for under 130 and its a great mic
plus they are all padded afor protection
link to a bass amp or subwoofer and you definitely have full sound
the thing is i hate overpaying for things
you can never go wrong with a kyser
this is my second order of the 10 pack
i use it with my fender mustang
for the money it does the job ok
i frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously its a huge convenience
they are the right length and go on easy enough
you will not regret it
now all i gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks
have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state
still trying to get the overblow
that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit
as a dedicated nylonstring player im always looking for the holy grail of amps
i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way
with just a simple screw it comes right off
a lot of overdrivedistortions filters modulations delays reverbs all carefully modeled
looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered
if youve seen the youtube videos then you know what this can do
i hate changing strings without one anymore
absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret
i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp
the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards
not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day
but it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultraportable
a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps
the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit
ill just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesnt have one
most 12ax7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should
kudos to tascam for making such good headphones
i figure i got at least 249 worth of guitar for 99
they have a really nice sound to them
yes the battery is difficult to replace
it is very sturdy and holds big music books very well
same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo
i am very pleased with the 34new sound34 of my tele
for the price it should be and is great
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii
ill use nothing but snarks
fortunately i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve
maybe adding something to keep it screwed in
its got some solid pres and has enough for me to work with
im quite disappointed and it sits here with no use
when you place it on a surface top of your amp floor your knee
this is the one hands down worth a minimum of 150
but variable speed would have been nice
thats the problem with mail order
however the ibanez ts9dx does more than your typical tube screamer
absolutely no complaints about these cables
and i no longer had to worry about the pick slipping
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb
they hold a nice amount of picks
i think amazon had the best price
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
hope it goes away soon
the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box
if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment
not perfect but pretty god
either way i am happy with them
unfortunately theres no 22nd fret on this guitar
they work great on my acoustic and electric guitars
now i can take it along and use it in europe asia and usa
once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner
i play a taylor 414ce
i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage
one of these should come standard issue with every guitar
it is affordable and the material is solid enough that it can withstand abuse
i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result
the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable
this is my new favorite rock pick
i definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together
they had some great 34spank34 and sounded great
it doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either
but i should have known that going into a 6 double right ended cable
so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes
dont miss out on this great deal
love it love it love it
added november 8 i put the star back
this makes a great gift item
boss dd7 beats the pants off the line 6 echo park delay
makes me wonder how ever played without them
not a lot of moving parts on this piece
it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound
plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker
the neck had a huge bow in it
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
once configured however its been solid
each string is labeled so you know which goes where
the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point
the planet waves capo trumps mykyserin both speed and ease of use
these cables are really the best
after consistent use its going strong
these will be my mainstay
nice thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky
and there is room for more if i need it
ive never had one of these pots fail on me
i am using three guitars on stage when possibleroom permitting
i drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit
tried it on a martin d28
i have little experience with tube voodoo
im sure ill be using the crybaby for the rest of my music life
the instructions describe 16 sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor
i could not expect a better violin stand
i had the red snark and a couple others
they used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves
it sits well on any sixstring though is not flat enough for a classical
we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it
tap function also helps a lot
they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster
this pedal works but doesnt have the depth of echo i expected
pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings
so far i havent had any issues at all
the dava master control pick dmcp is a very nice  useful pick
the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for
it has a great tone balance to my ears
inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge
this is an all metal exc
i would do business with them again
stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully
this little stand collapses and sets up so easy
i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results
these switches really are very handy
it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out
recreates spring reverb very accurately
it looks and fits just as shown in the picture
though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own
having played guitar for 45 years i have tried and used many many capos
this is my first fatsoflex cable
for the price this is a steal
ive used this pedal with a casio px200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now
i like the light guage
great sound and stays in tune
tap twice to stop play of the loop
grip is good and the thickness is just right for me
these head phones are a much better solution
i would buy this again
they are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding
oh well just shows me little by little more and more things arent anymore
it presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack
have recommended to several students
could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os 106
the 3 foot is perfect and it works great
i decided to conatct the on stage people directly
sweet sound with an older fender amp unit though
it is not heavy and the price is good
then order this great little solution to a big problem
not i have piles and piles of picks going unused
i want them to last longer
guess that notch in the peg winder is it
this is my first petal of  any kind
if youre an active performer maybe
these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings
peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less
this is a nononsense cheap guitar stand
its powered via the usb
these are excellent guitar picks
i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead
i love the fact that the feet do this
just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you
the jack was visibly wiggly too
it sounds great and it has loads of power
dont enjoy them as much on acoustic
live and in the studio these strings work for everything
if you drop a pick there is another right there
i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum
the mic holder has the same issue
plugged it into my fender mini tonemaster amp
remember this amp is not for metal
the metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions eighth notes sixteenthsetc
overall though its a good buy for your line 6 amp
this are a great value for your buck
do take note that this stand has a us standard 58 top
very smashing pumpkins feel to this
its been good i cant really complain considering its basically tree sap
no tone loss at all
the rogue analog delay is wellconstructed and feels very high quality given the price
i started searching around and found this product
the photo cannot do it justice
suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these
it feels more sturdy than the h2
i would think it would work even better with a mic
this is fine as a general stickon inexpensive pick holder
i researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit
go with the planet waves lock straps
the distortion was much more fizzy
this guitar support couldnt be simpler
only thing i regret is not getting one sooner
because when its switched on without the battery theres no sound coming from it
helps the grip a lot
does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack
im impressed with these exp16 guitar strings
its quiet and has a very active tone control
highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar
if looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further
it is very stable and solidly constructed
i love having the colored cables makes set up so easy
this is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes
i would only go with the sn2
well made and a fair price too
people say its an ocd clone
i consider this also to be a nonissue
i tried it on the boom arm and it made it topheavy and unstable
a string winder and cutter
id even pay a lot more for them
i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger
free shipping only makes it that much better
i was able to connect it to my pc
no foot pedals or expensive addons until you really have to have them
tutsplus dot comtutorialsbeginnersguidetoacoustictreatmentaudio1274 just replace the dot
also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth
wanted to hang my guitars on the wall
at first i didnt like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock
helps greatly to control acoustic feedback
it works well with cleaning spray
i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim
these picks break way too easy
look at the price because this thing really sounds good
i have two of these for my acoustics and when i get another acoustic
instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design
yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people
it is possible that this capo may become my favorite
i enjoy this very much
this is a xlr cable
again i reiterate maybe its just me
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together
if youre not using a pedal board these are just what you need
grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones
this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
i havent checked yet but id say there is a 4050 loss in volume
completely satisfied with this purchase
i use both electric and acoustic
i bought this stand after trying two others that didnt work well
so i bought based solely on the reviews here
this one built like a tank
its really really an amazing program
otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam
if theyre used for live performances they will not last very long
they dont taste like grapes however
it seems like it is good quality
its so light i dont notice its there
can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 23 hours
it works greatit keeps my music in order
my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings
it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too
let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect
theres nothing adjustable about the backrest
so things just roll around inside case
even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud
as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material
there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well
one of them is a capo
as with any pedal it wont make you a better player
but on my acoustics its been daddario j16s since day one and still is
i switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable
incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it
would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice
this dunlop ergo pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar
nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick
grab some extras because you will want more great pricegreat strings
the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend 90100usd for a tuner
unit works fine with my digital piano
it could be thicker  it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up
i have a few tuners that are somewhat like this gt1 clipon tuner
the sound is deep and heavy which is exactly what i was looking for
what could possibly go wrong
the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves
good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should
works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room
cons i wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me
please take a note of that
for what its supposed to do it works very well
i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better
ive been playing daddario xls in their standard
i might try it somewhere on the strap
can tune up quickly every time
if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note
its perfect for 23 acoustics and 12 electric guitars
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
this pedal is absolutely remarkable
the back clamps firmly to the guitar without maring the finish
it doesnt stay where you need it
i just did my 3rd weekend with the same set
takes some practice to appreciate all the features
this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down
this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs
i would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat
i was also intrigued by the 34tighter34 tuning aspect of the bars on this
the texture almost looks fake though
these are not going to unwind on you or break easily
i am a glutton for punishment
it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
what do you say about a little chip of celluloid
the best way to describe this stand
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
remove these rubber 34nonskid34 plates because they come off too easily
ive had mine for over a year now
buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits
the implications of this amp are really huge
i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model and after only one week
i bought this one to replace a shure 8900
i cant comment on how long theyll last or keep in tune
it is out there for 230 to 299
update   downgrading my rating by 1 star
90 is very inexpensive for a guitar
these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance
it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most
wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh
both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same
its got an attitude but it soft at the same time
they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty
you really will not be disappointed with these
of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp
clean low noise im used to the controls and love the sound of it
something i will have to get used to
im glad i tried something else
none that i can really tell
she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics
the 57 also seems to have more low end girth
i would buy it again
it also selfoscillates  freaks out quite well
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
at the time i had never owned a big muff
when it boils down to it i prefer my old planet waves tuner
using for audio acquisition for film  video purpose
works just fine thank you
to be honest i have no idea where this is coming from
they always give me good picks to use
easy to assemble and use
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
i have the small version
the reviews on all joyo products are extremely polarizing
this one appears to be an exception to that rule
volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results
its a sound that many would like to acheive
the behringer at108 along with my fender amp gives me plenty of performance capability
keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break
i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals
i like the dunlop design and price
i like having the variety though
it sounded like i was in a great concert hall
also i read several comments here that this isnt a high gain distortion
have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems
dont know why i didnt buy this years ago
i play rythm leads and sing in my gig
i often record one part of a duet then play along with it
you will not be disapointed by it
they are even smoother and easier to play that i remembered them
the treble strings bend pretty easily
had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not elixir
its a decent tool at a good price so buy one
this cable is really good for the price
they are what i needed
i got 4 replacememts over 3 years
it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac30
the ab switch is kinda a nice touch
it just feels lighter than i like but thats a personal thing
holds your trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends
the 12 club zt is super loud
4 be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself
light strong and very balanced
obviously any small bump into the stand will once again set this off
the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
easy to install and hanging and releasing is a nobrainer
it just snaps on to your mic stand
the handle isnt going anywhere
the are the same as came on my guitar
can hold up to 11 picks of
cool design makes a big difference in you audio
an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed
the built in tap metronome is a cool idea
now im spoiled and ive become a guitar strings snob
it needs to be in front of a tube amp
these fit the american sized pots perfectly
this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well
measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or so
the locking top is a good feature as well
just find a stud and drill in the screws theyll hold just fine
its easy to put on and take off
check out the ada gcs3 if you can
also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order
they are very longlasting and sound great
the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about 45 on amazon
small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play
i dont think it lastforever but it works great for my peavey patriot guitar
this a solid performing unit at this price point
if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chart
behringer is a problematic company for me
the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guidescovers and provide good strain relief
previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums
within 5 minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect
the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support
you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
not really that good for  music
we review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about products
very well built cable and so far no hum at all
overall im really happy with this pedal
ive used elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again
this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments
so here it the continuum
the pdc21 is a nofrills device
anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical
stand away from my guitar when im playing and singing
give a good phase sounds like waylon would use
plastic attachment clutch and extremely thin gauge metal
or so maybe more if you keep them lower down
i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar
they figure a guitar that cheap cant be much good
most of the b pedals work quite well
i dont think the actual 14 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks
and this guy did the job
i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures
it would be nice if there was a sound feature
as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals
first the size is perfect in my rack configuration
the spring could definitely be tighter
the tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are ok
your strap is now locked in place
my takamine acousticelectric fits perfectly and is very stable on the stand
clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone
the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain
just slightly heavier feel but much more tone
25th i think others have mentioned problems with pylepro audios customer service
the guitar now sounds great
the e and b strings never have enough coating but still
he was very happy with his gift
that is where an amplifier comes in handy
fits in most guitar cases  is lightweight
it may not be much to look at but it works really well
i wish it were brighter and easier to see
do i fully understand how this works
the latest 34bargain basement34 squier strat bullet is no exception
i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods
wouldnt trust it again so i returned them
i installed reaper and immediately disliked its interface
most manufacturers dont list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed
i used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets
it claims to stop 34string talk34 when you rub fingers on wound strings
works as advertised but the keys are stiff
i prefer a bigger pocket but aside from that i cant complain
great durable foam contact points for cradling baby
it does a fantastic job at that
bar chords were terrific too
the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster
needless to say im not very pleased
this is a great package for beginners
the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand
this is by far the best ive ever had
have 2 problems with the strings
the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eqd for saturated distortion
great output jack i love this one much more because is more durable
i havent tried this through a pa live yet
you shouldnt be disappointed with this item
these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work
it gets abused so i dont look for it to last long
good quality accurate and not expensive
bought these for my sons electric guitar
these used to be expensive noneessentials but today theyre small accurate and portable
could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough
works with the new mic my daughter got for christmas and nice quality cord
likewise it worked well with my 4string bass as well
i bought this one for its adjustability
i just got these to collect not to use to play with
the main genres i play inharmonics and sustain to spare
these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
i works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it
it doesnt seem to work
this package of picks is of good colors and good weight
but despite those limitations the bad monkey is awesome
we mounted our two ukes on these
not much to say here  theyre knobs
leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel
you should listen to both to know which is right for you
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time but thats not really a problem
plays great to the top fret
they sound great for my style of play equipment and setup
that being said that person probably isnt playing much guitar
i wont be buying these again
you need a little time to learn then it will rock you
it makes my guitar feel secure
only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds
i missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered
but i did have to give up tube amp option
comes in a pouch which helps to put it away
common complaint i have seen   no clean channelpreset
it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat
it will save you a fortune
that is a great bonus for me
the gray dunlops dont look anywhere near as cool as these
i would recommend it to any friend and i already have
the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards thats well known
definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that ive come across
there is no way this is true bypass
purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my sons acoustic guitar
long time shubb user but decided to try something different
this is a very nice product to use
these are great  have 3 of them now
not a warranty a guarantee
i got this on sale from gc for 80 shipped plus 7 tax arrrgh
they fit all of my gear
tons of character and tone
stays in place well and is very convenient
consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand
great deal from amazon   thanks
comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding
i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head
this pedal works with the yamaha motif that was my main concern when ordering
i also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend
ive been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding
i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner
there isnt a huge difference
this was exactly what i needed this being the 3rd compressor i bought
it is very easy to use
it is still in great condition
the product picture can be a little deceiving
i teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner
but the elixir sounds  feels better
most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass
also it not to big
it is a great reliable tuner
the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion
013s on a taylor 210 dreadnought
makes tuning a lot easier and accurate
its does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
goodsounding and playing allaround strings
que mas se puede decir
bought another one for my friend
you get what you pay for
fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube
so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound
i wholeheartedly endorse the product
what more can i say
first of all this strap looks super cool
5 stars arrived on time and in good condition
nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery
for me it sounded better than sm58
bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago
going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound
unless it was a cheap piece of crap
i am usually oneto read directions thoroughly but not this time
but i do feel confident in what i report here
in this set i especially like the 4th string at
it is well built performs well and sells at a very reasonable price
bought the focusrite unit instead
they always provide vibrant tonal quality
this rack is constructed better than i had really expected
it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on
a good buy well worth the price
its very rare thing to see now a days
the amp is just about perfect for bedroom studio or practice
i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money
includes a nice hard plastic carrycase too
hohner has been around forever well constructed instrument and very reliable company
thank you amazon  fender
now its in the effects loop just like my other delay
but the biggest change ive experienced is with the tone block change
im glad i dont need to stuck with this anymore
i ordered one the next day
these perform well on single coils specifically telecasters
both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker
tremolo varies the volume of the sound
some players are comfortable with the stock speaker
too expensive foronly one effect at a time
there is a problem with the design
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
ive tried many others but always come back to ernie balls
sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time
theyve been shrinking for over 50 years
size and fit were good
fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue
this is the first quickchange capo ive owned
wish i had sized them before i bought them
do you like to shift your booty around on the seat
this unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some
for the price i dont think it can be beat
you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea
this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap
the tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement
what really can you say about switchcraft they just make good solid parts
i bought an rp1 and it sounds much better
i have a 13 gooseneck a light condenser mic and small shockmount on it
well at least for me
what else could you want in a guitar strap
this is a very well made guitar stand
only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars
i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers
thank you fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size
these exp16s are superior to them all
otherwise a great hanger that i trust for use with my expensive guitars
i only use something different if i need a longer reach
i like that the pedal has a wide array of uses
just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices
im not sure if this is normal or not
we keep a can in every case
it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension
they last fairly long when taken care of and dont usually break too often
i really cant recommend this highly enough
measuring for fit and specifications is on the money
definitely theyre worth a try
shines nice and doesnt leave it feeling oilysticky
my fault but it shouldnt have broken so easily
the result was poor sound
i like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to
does the job of holding a mic
my guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65
this incredible inexpensive box really nails it
i might modify it for that
it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone
i use this pedal mainly for the 34church34 setting in ambient volume swells
i know thats bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming
my guitar now stays in tune better than my prs and epiphone
it makes my guitar look new again
it ties onto the headstock
i cheap buy and it works excellent
this case is the best ive ever had
i use audacity to amplify when necessary to normalize always and to edit from
touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys
love it and wouldnt wanna part with it
these stands are truly amazing
the device tunes within 610ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner
just put these on my martin dcx1e and they sound great
ive owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw
they dont know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings
the others 10 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also
the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic
three positions roughly correspond to 18 19 and 20 inches
do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure
but it wont hurt your back
i bought this for my kids aged 6  8 they love it
it does however sound amazing
pick that is i did have an older brother
it makes it so much easier
the hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability
lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteries
excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass
the first arms the track the second begins the recording
if you want something close on
i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good
it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too
but it works well and the batteries seem to last
they either use too much or too little
it is part of my regular arsenal
used the 942s for years but thought i would give these a try
the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable
of course that could just be my expectations
if this happens to you dont worry
it cuts the medal strings like butter
mine wasnt that cracked and it worked great
folds up easy fits great
this mixer is just what ive been looking for
it works perfectly and my recording are rich and full
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws
overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3
its for studio not live performances
this was my first fender amp as well
this is an amazing guitar for the price
got a new tenor uke and couldnt resist putting my fav strings on it
pros  size size and size
all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on
the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel
works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle
just be extra careful handling them
this tuner works for sure but i dont think its the best out there
the 5star ratings must be from employees
if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp
i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro
a must have for us dry californians
but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica
drop in replacement for both my mim and mia strat
it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less
id buy this again without hesitation though
outlets 182113 can all be used to power either 9v or 12v pedals
i usually buy the elizir but i thought id give these a try
adjusted for inflation that would be 800 when i bought this jasmine
i dont know what else to say
polish w an expansive polishing cloth
both knobs at 12 oclock toggle in middle didnt change the internal switches
these are very well constructed and function very well too
our tips  cd sales have gone way up
it aired in a few minutes
it works on vibration or mic so its very versatile
no noticeable noise added to my ears
not exactly what i wanted
then to my surprise the squier strat was delivered yesterday
as with all boss products ive been very happy
this pick is great highly recommended
i use this strings with an ibanez rg custom with dimarzios
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
the product works as advertised and amazon has the best deal
these flex steels are excellent
i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim
used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices
im very pleased with this stand
it doesnt do many different tones but what it does it does very well
i drilled into wooden studs
i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited
so i decided to get a set of strap locks
come on guys not all of your customers are 13 years old
very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep
otherwise i really like this harmonica
it is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use
a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality
the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these
these are very well made with the heads well secured
im extremely happy with the build quality and performance
they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible
really simple little review here
i have a lovehate relationship with compressors
i have to rethink the way i use fx in this box
ill try returning it and getting the sn8
yeah i think a few of these would be nice
it began to tear on my guitar strings
ive had no trouble with it that i can rememberthink of
these strings arent anything fancy but they sound great
ive read the revues and some dont do them justice
no loss of tone through these cables
to be clear  i am quite the newbie guitar player
i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch
i dont know i think so  others may not
works great with my on stage keyboard stand
im a blues guitarist so they take a beating well
considering i spent 600 for itit rules
i dont like it hanging in my guitar
bought these to replace some gold ones on a les paul clone
the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small
so far for 200 bucks
still use it for practice and wont change it
adds thick creamy distortion enhances harmonics and maintains great attack and definition
is what it is and does what it says its does
this board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply
ive tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc
the strap that came with it is no great shakes either
it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect
because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks
second i dont like having a lot of pedals
it works perfectly with my sound card
i like this better than my old snark
ive purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work
wish they had put that in some instructions
ok reviewing somethings i just dont see the need
that is an easy fix
i tried the cad m179
i would perfectly tune the guitar with the snark and then apply the capo
i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these
not a lot of bass
and the sound is good
at least the ones i was sent
however the bag was ripped in 3 places
i liked how solid it was
my verdict   go with medium or hard version
i would definitely buy this brand again
it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it
its cheapit worx what more to say
i do like the built in pick holder
this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank
so not really a con
just so i could make some sort of comment about it
ranging from a 12 musiciansfriend promotional item to a 200 rack mount
beware that there is a learning curve to looping
fender start appears to take the system wellonly time will tell
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
what i use for wah is the digitech rp250 processor
narrowing it down to daddario and elixirs
of course if it can accurately handle 8s it will breeze through anything thicker
thanks to amazon for offering such a good product
there are exactly as described and do the job
for lead these sound dull
mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose
they have a nice textured grip
perfect for what i want to do
this is a great bag regardless of cost
the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful
quite a few people are complaining about the buzz causedinduced by this
i really like the mediums
and i really like this one
i just purchased an electricacoustic epiphone ukelele today for my chiropractor
they are definitely more comfortable
the only complaint i have is that theyre too thin for me
i am a little disappointed
i bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips
seemed too cheap to work
it has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents
sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried
trick  treat your room with sound deadening
great stereo sound out of the keyboards
i appreciate its compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock
i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out
small amazing good quality interface
just as good as any 20 xlr out there
they work great with my pedals
i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition
dig in and it puts out distortion play soft and it cleans up
they dont cost a lot and they work well
i use it with a small amp for singing
my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets
it is amazing what difference the strings can make
24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain
the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges
doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though
its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident
came with a great little travel bag
i dont think you could break this beast if you wanted to
best sounding of all smooth on my fingers
original reviewrecently i got the itch to try different unique picks
amazing the besti cant believe
the green cable is good for that
my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive
theres a slight hiss too
the weight of the stand itself stripped it
when i first started on guitar i put
it makes a dynamic mic sound great
youtube videoed how to do it
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around
the base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy
most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for
anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this
if i lost my pedal i would order another right away
the bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised
i was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle
overall i give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter
i bought 2 of these and will order a few more
it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing
i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol
geart for setups and takedowns
not sure how to rate this tube
i use a lot of behringer equipment and no i dont work for behringer
i really like this cable
and gavemy grandson a shockblue one to go with his american flag painted uke
i would not put them on most martin dreadnoughts for example
if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise
oh and this goes without saying upgrade the stock strings
additionally mine came very well setup from the seller aside from the inevitable tuning
sounds decent and stays in tune
we will be purchasing more picks in the future
my c5ce washburn has been a very good purchase
probably the best kapo out on the market
this product has turned out to be great with few exceptions
a little goes a long way
overall im quite pleased with the unit
this is a cheaply built cable
dont waste your  on others with similar specs
it was made for the military
the tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price
the fitment to the power supply is there
perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic
it gets one less star because of the california prop 65 warning
made my little martin look almost as good as new
great value and price too
this is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times
nice flexible easy to hold and i received on time at a great price
i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc
just restrung my 12 string
very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites
our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready
this is the perfect amp for bed practice
the mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance
weighs a ton cool logo made in usa
the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched
i ordered this kit to see what it would do
it has some fun effects
can get all of the reverb sounds you want
the planet waves pwct12 is my new favorite
and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets
i cant comment on the looper as i never used it
i recommend this mount highly
if you need a beater this is it
overpriced 15 to 2x in my opinion
ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3
the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f47 rc guitar
this pedal is very easy to use
a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact
i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long
the quality seems to be good and installation went fine
so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing
its a decent unit but stopped working completely after about 6 months
so it is an amazing critic for us beginners
paradoxical i know but thats where the magic of this strap is
what about the eh metal muff
is it valuable as such
so far i really like these
they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick
it doesnt cost a lot
amazon has this harp marked down to about the 25 level
but once its on it works
its reasonably quiet acoustically but it shines when plugged in
buy the pedal its great
i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great
ive used this stand for about two years now and it held up great
then again i dont tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as
i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100
i got it today in the mail and i already tried it
it looks cool and sounds just fine and clear
i dont think that many people would do this
that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances
its so much warmer than the boss
solos just sing on this amp
it has switches so each input can be a linein or microphone preamp
a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa
the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal
brilliant solution to the strap button problem
to me 1520 is way too much for a guitar hanger
they are great and last forever
3setup the intonation using a tuner
replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
the action is of course too high
i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear
more importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedalboard space
nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone
nice addition to my studio
the behringer headphone amp was only ok
they have a smooth unhyped sound
after a little break in these brought some new life back into my amp
blues blues slide rock metal
but lets be clear what a tube overdrive pedal is and isnt
the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone
the string cutter works like a champ
i like playing it too
well worth the extra investment
construction is about as good as i would normally get on a 13 item
but like i said it good for the price
they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot
this strap is very well made
trust me ive played for 13 years
i had it close but its the fine tuning that really helps
not upset about that  stuff happens
it works well hasnt broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned
i bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo
its easy to use clip it on and go
i find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold
the design of this product is innovative and excellent
clips onto pretty much any mic stand
second would be an fx loop
the display is very easy to read
naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling
martin is at the top of the heap
either way its losing another star
these are allparts parts quick usps shipping
you wont be disappointed on this buy
there arent enough uke straps out there for a good price
i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction
for under 20 these little tuner is all you need
it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it
thank god for the website that had this on a blog
how does it sound you ask
good little stand to hold your guitars
i turned that light off and the buzz went away
if you dont have one get one
of coursei could not recommend this product to anyone
so theyre good sounding strings and they last a long time
i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek
this mixer has four mic inputs
im glad i bought it
the english instructions arent really useful as the pedal itself is selfexplanatory
quiet  much quieter than other compressors in this price range
nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style
my son has also joined in the fun
however you cannot go wrong with those strings
i bought this to replace a behringer uca202
i really like the fitfeel of this plucking pick
it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks
problem solved quickly and elegantly
theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which im happy with
transporting them in this case isnt
i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail
has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way
its the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place
the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals
the 48 is made in mexico
using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
have tons of picks  but seem to use this one all the time
i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly
i cant bend at all so no idea if its just me
it was like a dry erase pad
easy to take with you or set on a small shelf
these picks have a good grip
well surprise surprise surprise it didnt feedback and it sounds great
its light but stays in place okay
this is a really nice microphone
the behringer reputation pulls through once again
pin 3 then ties to pin 1 with the ground wire
so its like that guy who asks for a lighter
it is very sturdy and stable
they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there
the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors
does as described and really enhances your tone
they feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard
the pp400 ultracompact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like its ultracompact
at home might sound ok
if you have issues with the driver definitely update
if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal
i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well
these are some bright strings
fender really got close with the modeling
not the best but for the price was a killer deal
i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer
pro removes friction for faster playing
no matter what color the floorcarpetstage is you can find your pick easily
just to find out it wasnt working
it has a mastering section with effects
phantom power would be nice then also
second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser
the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze
watch youtube to compare models
everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage
made my tone thin and tinny
as far as amps that model vintage tones
even in perfect condition its still a subpar case
i own at least 8 of these
nice picks much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks
there are two on settings  regular on and fx on
but as far as sound they are great
or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background
well thats not quite true
they have a high build quality and work great
price also great with budget
25 stars rounded up to 3
with practice ive become more proficient
it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length
they hold a variety of guitars just fine
i like a cheese pizza
this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy
if the puppy murders this one ill order up another one just like this
i use these light guage strings because i have arthritis
oh and the case is a 40 freebee  buy one be happy
i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence
every acoustic is different though
all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar
it fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes
qualitywise it feels a bit cheapish
i did find a solution
it is very reasonably priced as well
why do i use them then
60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the same
really awesome item for any type of electric guitar
could be more tapered for such a tiny pick
i stuck this on her amp so she would not misplace it
this was for a friend who needed a guitar capo
i didnt want to spend 600 on a wah with a rack
at the time i bought was 16
plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal
i needed light without the heat
it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too
i play mostly blues and classic rock
as a guitar player i recently march 2013 started to play the uke
im completely amazed with this capo
ive removed 1 star because of the 14 casing
from the front you can barely notice it at all
i have a les paulmarshall class 5bb preampep boosteranalog chorus and carbon copy
this is a beautiful shock mount
it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price
originally i purchased a behringer eq700 equalizer pedal for my rig
this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction
mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective
im using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick
its easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly
like other kk pickups it sounds darned good
its won a spot on my pedalboard and im picky
the balance between quality and price is good
it has a nice big pedal for big feet
these have good shielding not like the others
but this one worked perfectly
the 10s are my choice for rock and blues
this is a great music stand
with the snark any of them
this is a nice small amp
fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out
im not a pro by any means
whats great about the dunlop design they work
the lead cuts clean 34mostly34
this is a great pedal to put at the end of your fx chain
13 strings and well is simply too much
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise
without this i would be lost
i would buy more if i needed them
this is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much
i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty
the other one is shorter
playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine
winder string cutter and end pin remover
but i figured how can you go wrong
the hue control gently affects the tone
these cables didnt disappoint me either
good sustain and strings are staying in tune well
good tone good sustain and they stay in tune
i can get 4 completely different sounds out of it
i would purchase this again
dava picks are one of lifes guilty little pleasures
the korg cm100l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product
well you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar
didnt have to install any kind of driver
this is the best at combining two tools into one
i am very happy with the guitar
sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications
but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here
snark tuners are the best
i cant think of any other pedals ive owned that could do this
you can read my verypositive review on the epiphone on amazon
this does it perfectly well
this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one
i have the older version of this as well this newer one
i would not recommend it
he badly needed an upgrade from his ludwig jr kits bass pedal
unlike other cheap chinesemade ripoffs ahem
same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor
28to be fair someone did finally contact me today
not one product has let me down yet
i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to redo the board
planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff
i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well
the sixinline enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping
i would recommend these to anyone
i love the snark tuners and i own several different models
i recommend them to do the job for the
people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix
and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality
this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine
ill definitely buy more and highly recommend them
this tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument
my testing is ongoing and cannot give the elixir a top rating yet
it is very easy to apply great results and very little effort
just make it one solid piece
these are currently the only cables i use on my pedalboard
super tight and easy to lower
there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz
ive found a new favorite pick
i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar
i love it so much ive purchased this and my  own shure mic
this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions
i am working on getting that nice way sound which ive come across somewhat
i would rather concentrate on making music
i have owned just about every tuner made
works ok for the price and features it is fine
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours
replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and im glad i did
but positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily
one note  this does not come with any picks
i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate
this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument
it is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer disclaimer
i dont know if its just mine or is something inherent in this pedal
its also the cheapest one i ever bought
super buy on this miniamp
id recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like
once you try these picks you never go back
again it works perfectly for my situations
but how does it perform
i highly recommend this guitar stand
it is well made and i would buy it again if needed
i have used ernie ball strings for along time
great product for the price
they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end
the tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine thats a pleasure to use
the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things
wouldnt use anything low quality for that guitar
was ready to go out of the box
highly recommended for the adventurous uke player
it has impressed me quite a bit since then
just another example of the incompetence at fender
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position
to let you know what i need in an interface 1
overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down
i like this one the best
however these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly
unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand
matin coated are good too
i cant believe what you can get for the price on this one
this is an absolutely amazing reverb pedal
id recommend it to anyone
the pedal is everything i expected from it
there are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly
inf file that is important
the carbon copy is the best there is
im going to buy a couple more as gifts
the headphone amp was of particular concern for me
now it looks beautiful again
the 2534 is wide and comfy
for the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck
it is what it is
i think this patch looks cool on the bass
ive written a review before
great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking
the backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this
this fit the bill perfectly
battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it
my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications
but then i tried this
presets tap tempo and a nice feature set
this is a really good patch cable
skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc
well see how helpful they really are
i had a hard time lineing them up to install
i couldnt find the other one because theyre small and black
using it couldnt be simpler and it has excellent contrast
this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap
this took a little getting used to but it does work very well
they seem to be decent quality
directions dont include the proper details
for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable
this one is very thick and solid like its supposed to be
frets were smooth rounded and played nice
the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out
i am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading
it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard
i almost feel like i wont even need strap locks its so good
distortion pedals go much better with solid state
downloading is quick and easy
all workand the distortion control
it is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions
ive been buying these strings for a while now
the nine leds really light up my music stand
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs no success
not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon
the quality is always the same
and oh my it records good
and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use
the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set
the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance
most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned
i have always found their quality to be very good for the price
the color stands out well on the black background
thanks guys for the great little product
after my custom telecaster fell
thinking about buying another one
an hour after its applied it sets up and doesnt get on your hands
i did not care for the tone or feel
this pedal is great help on stage
i recently went electric again after 20 years
i want to get more guitarjust to get a other one
well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around
they are inexpensive and pretty
best of all warranty for life
its construction is extremely solid and its heft gives it stability
they did nothing to help my overbraced 1970 gibson j50 though
its just another example of tc hitting it out of the park yet again
very close to the sound of an sm58
this is the best amp in this category
for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish
are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals
really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile
it will polish and lube things like floyd roses
the screen is so dark and only viewable head on
if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal
i have to say that i love the strings
the snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything ive ever seen
i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up
i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes
ive never met a set i liked in any single way
these are great patch cables
small diameter gives it a shrill overtone
but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at soundhole
so most ukes dont fit well
not the greatest cord i have ever used not the worst either
i bought two more today
since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings
the 8020 are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp
for the price you really cant go wrong with this guitar stand
the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference
havent had to change tuning once they settled in
aside from that this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit
this is what all distortion pedals are judged by
they look great feel great and play great
tue quality is very nice solid and resistible
and its always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions
keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time
i would highly recommend it
but i like em both
the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo
and it does make some noise in my chain
it was a good deal did the job
i havent used it much on my electrics
one stand fits not all
no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall
i record songs in my home as a hobby
for a ten spot ya cant do better
what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss
i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately
basically the cherub is just too sensitive
you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this
will only need a minor setup
thanks for taking care of me
this box is very well made and will last a long time
i just got this to run my passive pa
could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall
no feedback or buzz from it
save this as a preset
its rugged and i like it
im glad i bought this product
in my humble opinion the pictures make the product look purple
i have one for each guitar and just leave them on
the color was a good match for the guitar
overall they work really well and look sharp
i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case
i mean seriously how hard can it be
there are usually two wires of differing color
it sounds awesome and is built like a tank
its the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly
i ordered a new tank and now its great
other than that im not quite sure what makes it specifically a 34ukulele tuner34
ten bands is a little overkill for guitar
i got mine through musiciansfriend for around 2 shipped
i just leave it on my telecaster
the midi clock sync implementation is flawed
great stand for the price
plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
firstfinding a driver to use was a pain
or at least not much
some users report quality issues here  i guess time will tell on that
its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musicians
i still play this on almost every day
finish playing slide your pick into this and its there when you play again
these do a good job of isolating out the sound
you cant go wrong with any snark
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
the tone none the less is very usable and sounds great
long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable
it isnt shrilling or peaky at all
an excellent value for the money
nope no flaws noticeable to me
its tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe
also it quit working suddenly after about a year
this product isnt really one to review but it does what it advertises
i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices
yes one side in my test sounded better i felt
sorry if im rambling but seriously im in love with this pedal
mostlly notnecessary for me but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too
easy to use seems to be well made
the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright
i like it its ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion
since hes 11 he doesnt have many opportunities to play with others
i think its worth a hundred dollars
daddario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around
unfortunately my extralong fingers find this very difficult to play
not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style
the design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on
5 stars in my book more if theyd allow that
holds my guitars just fine
goes through 9v batteries quickly so stock up
this worked well for that
i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree
im a beginner and i try to learn to play guitar
great product for a great price
i have had 2 of these tuners youd think id learn after one
the pick had a little more give so i dropped them less
this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain
i bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case
they are clean of any electrical noise
the good this box is simple and welldesigned
we learned to play thanks to this kit
so thats four broken strings in less than 20 hours play
i have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it
175 for a roundback is really a no brainer
they seat snug and enhances sustain
it was to be shipped from japan
another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power
it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ xd
it was an 34uh duh34 moment
it operates on two aa batteries included
i ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends
i tried it and the quality is low end
i put these strings on my guild acoustic electric
here are a couple of more casual notes 1
a very good pedal that you miss only when its off
there is no close second
the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects
it didnt smell like the other reviews said either
the tascam dp008ex is great
it costs more but has more functional value to me
this cable is a great cable for the price
theyre pointy so theyre good for fast picking
free shipping gotta like thatcons  only one power setting 15v
i loadedthe effect into a slot
it will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which i love
and honestly for me thats what i need
just gettit if u are in a budget
the stand is very well constructed and very stable
so know that going in
it gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft
the volume control is obvious
cons  none to speak of
to them i8217d say these are worth checking out
there is however no mounting point  no captive nuts or such
used them for years  always loved them
these are the best cables for the money
its also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing
but if youre popping and slapping these come through loud and clear
i love these microphones i really do
this is my favorite go to tuner
see my customersupplied photos at the top of the page for examples
i leave it plugged in on the board all the time
however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional
however these power slinky strings are great
i would look elswhere for a different product
these daddarios have worn quite well and still sound excellent
they need to fix the info on their web page
too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly
i use the 15 mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years
is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough
pickers playing next to me dont interfere with me tuning
i bought one for myself as well and i do like it
in this case i agree
and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports
it was an immediate difference
i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while im playing
its awesome to use and efficient
havent had any problems with it at all so far
the difference is that 160 can be modified by the user or left asis
highly recommended very happy with purchase
88 mm picks for that
first impression of profx8 is very good
works well with my stuff
i have yet to break one
it tunes nicely and so far as my ear is concerned accurately
also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo
try it you wont be disappointed
the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leatherlike material
i dunno cause im stingy with stars
ive even used this on matte or light finishes with good results
but i like the build quality and the speed control
i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily
for a clipon you cant beat the accuracy this little unit gives you
this 12 pack was about the same price as 23 packs of elixirs
i use it on my acoustic and electric guitars
ive used many brand for my guitars for years
if i had it to do all over i would save my money
every guitarist should have this
i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one
this is certainly a heavy duty stand
nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively
shipping was faster than advertised
no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldnt handle the load
spend some more money if you want something good
no matter how i adjust it it has a muddy sound
this is my second and i love them so much
schaller guitar strap locks work really really well
got it for 500 bucks and wish id bought about 5 more
this is my guitar pick of choice
bought to tune my bass
the push button action is most convenient vs
they are cheap and look good
i wasnt expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner
so are these any good
excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal
just in conclusion theres basically nothing this amp cant do at least fairly well
im going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars
also the pedal just started oscillating a few times
but for metal big strings i stick with ernie ball
for lead i needed to use something harder
i know daddario loves the color coded ends
as i said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen
more expensive is not always better
almost a gold but not quite
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all
my guitar stays in tune when capoed
played for a half hour and retuned sounded better
i also heard about the wonderful warranty that monster has
you guessed it  distortion
feel like its a tricky rebate
actually while the amp is cheap its also fairly durable
heres what i noticed  the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range
something about eb strings they really are slinky  whatever that means
great little amp just not for me
it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible
and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out
i own three other behringer pedals as well and theyre still going strong
holy buckets of tone batman
you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal
granted you can make a makeshift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon
ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job
all in all it works and i am pleased
i share most of the same sentiments
good quality parts on an essential product
also i like having the two polar patterns switchable from cardioid to omni
the tool is made of sturdy plastic
pt 9 is all i need
5 stars because of the price and what i was expecting to get
theres not much to say about this product except that it works
to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe
which is yet another step forward in highquality home recordings
ive used electronic tuners for a long time
i am really impressed with this mic
it make the process of replacing the strings so much faster
my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree
well be buying these for a long time to come
i will buy another in a second color
if its too muddy you can add treble
so ill try to give you the information you need to make your purchase
no dice so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots
been using these for years
this one looked sturdy enough
i use this with my audio technica condensor
like a perfect marshall but with more organicness
well constructed durable built to last
these do very nicely for that purpose
they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i8217ve played
the price was right from amz
looking back cant see why i really need it
i just got it today
very easy to grip and last long
like the capo and metronome feature
the polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster
some have complained that its construction is not the best
i still check but they just wont pull out or release
these drops are not just a convenience
maybe a dollar if they dont just give it to you
it wont handle well at a large space
its really like magic in a can
immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings
no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it
all in all its a nice little capo
i think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles
this arrived a week sooner then expected
i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks
saves space at cramped gig sites
for the price you cant complain
at the most competitive price available
sturdy flexible and well designed
the mxr phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units
awesome little tool and very impressed with it
you feel different when there is a stand holding the mic
once i got the hang of it i had no problems
this thing is like a magic spray
it works well for sure
these plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for
you can use delay just not with very rapid repeats
since it died that first time it doesnt seem to perform the same
this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal
it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar
and a previous reviewer said his dot with bigsby fits
worse even than the oils and acids on our skin
i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp
you wont get a slightly fizzy ultragain think slipknot sound out of this pedal
good idea but way too lightrickety to be useful
get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain
it does everything i wanted and the price was right
this is such a lifesaver or an effort saver
holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on
sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti
what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone
i would recommend this product to everybody
this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard
as the description says this is a mild overdrive
ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends
so it will work the same with both
ive been using these strings for many years
this is the best delay i have tried thus far
it seems much more twitchy than the sn1
good strength  holds the strings down well
i have been playing for 9 years
i put the nyxl set on my ibanez artist with dimarzio  humbuckers
with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process
it does one job only but it does it so well
does it for you so you dont have to do it by ear
its great for a desk or a small recording studio
it actually delivers much more sound than i expected
with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time
the stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things
im sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me
i will be set to go
of all of them i especially like lopera jade
no need for a fancy pansy 50 metal mesh screen
i play my ipod through a small guitar amp
have them on four guitars
it is an extremely well made and solid product
buy a few youll be glad you did
very light but sturdy and is portable
thats a subjective thing i suppose
bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops
then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made
its not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily
again this is with les paul humbuckers
and i love using the word snark
i may have to tape it down to keep it in place
its fast and easy just like a tuner should be
ive ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags
i tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards
the audio adapter is well built
it helped some but didnt get rid of the noise entirely
so i ordered 6 more packs of these
the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will
this is a very stable comfortable seat
its going back to the store where i purchased it
sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune
im happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas
its okay to soak the wood as long as its momentary
this little tuner does the job
for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere
i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present
they are a little small
this mic has amazing quality
got this tunermetronome as a replacement for a tuneronly model
that said this pedals has some wonderful uses
i was blown away how it could tune my bass
you put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x
the base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory
great attack but holding onto it is the problem
i dont have any tone loss between these and
i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets
bought a second set from dougs tubes ruby el84czs select matched jjs
very good for light portable set ups
if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably
it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone
i certainly have no complaints
i could find nothing better on the market for the price and features
i was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself asap
it sounds amazing for the price
ive used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great
i really like these things
the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights
practical useful for drum kit
that at some point the tradeoff does indeed make sense
i love this wall hanging mount
solid no problems with the solder joints
this is a big help at rehearsals
i have not tried it with other stringed or nonstringed instruments
i dont use auto gain
i do not know if it will fit other guitars
weird suggestion   hang on to the box it comes in
the epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days
nice addition for the price
this was my first shoulder rack and i didnt know what to expect
this product is great for using a softphone or other communications program
oooops my bad when i discovered they were only 2 longer
thought about buying the expensive g7th capo but im very glad i didnt
these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass
you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed
edit  the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle
we will continue to use beefy slinky strings
one gets in the way of the other
i was even surprised they included a battery
the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity
i am now dedicated to these strings
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
its a must for any rambunctious guitar player
they all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade
it means they need to be replaced
it is a quality heavy cloth case with a feltvelvet lining
the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy
heavy duty and rugged it should last forever
i just got the 3rd monitor
lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth
i have recently been very impressed with some of behringers products
then i saw this one
a friend gives his time to help kids learn music
i am pleased with the product
i use mine on a martin hd28 and have had no problems whatsoever
what more can i say
this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish
i would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on
they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets
5 stars because it works as its described and has a nice display
i only wish it went up to 11
for the money you can not beat this
purchased this to replace a behringer pedal because the behringer introduced a swishing sound
once the input is active in software the light becomes green
easy to navigate and understand
its small works well and fairly inexpensive
does it sound like an overdriven amp
this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good
i got this for 150 dollars when it was on sale
i have also found that the ernie balls break easily as well
lots of looping time simple to use unlimited overdubs
i am very happy i did
i have replaced packs twice
i just appreciate a great value and daddario strings are just that
the action is low and the guitar structure is perfect
i actually own an even dozen of these
it is a  great product
use the crybaby with other effect pedals the uses are endless and fun
mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine
those compliments apply equally to the cs3 compression sustainer
the snark is well worth its small price
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
take 1015 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor
but i enjoyed listening to it while playing
that being said it is good for practice and song writing
forget the fab series they are not so hot
this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar
it had been dropped on its head
this is a fantastic product if you understand its limitations
i bought this guitar nearly a year ago
this is perfect for that
a little goes a long way
the 65 twin reverb on the orange level is by far my favorite
just remember that this model is for standard type axes strats teles and such
i have a routine with mine
looks nice displayed in the corner of my office
daddario strings are simply the best
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it
im using a fender jaguar this thing is married to it
this proco rat pedal does not use that
this holder may work well for harmonica for some people
they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison
buy it you will have a ball
for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb
the size of the clipon gt1 one is also great
the other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that
73 mm picks  i would consider them medium thickness
i still have open leads for those other pedals
then i recheck with my other brand and its not even close
the nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference
out of the box it has a nice weight to it
i have no complaints about the construction the looks or the price
it has what you want in a cable and not what you dont
make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60db of clean gain
for this price you cant beat the item
get a snark and you will be happy
you might even become the next joe satriani
these are well made cables with 90degree connectors which is exactly what we needed
switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot
at 25 i figured i could chance it
very portable and does the job it was designed to do
i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues
lately its become my goto tuner
these capo i know will lose their tension in time
this gig bag was just what i needed to carry around a soprano ukelele
after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved
i expect to buy more of these in the future
the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube
does a shock mount make a difference in sound
onebutton operation makes it simple to operate
installed on two guitars and i love them
a google earth view of their addressed explained it all
maybe there is something i need to do differently
its been the vintage tube monster every time
you get the bright booming sound
this is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture
i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since
i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me
ive only used plugin types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise
small improvement but not close enough
coulda had a veggie drink
the first ukelele was a lanakai lu21
thanks for a great product and good prompt service cheers
im glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available
have used it several times and first battery still has juice
i like this mic very much
great pedal for the money get it
it comes with two buttons two washers and 4 screws two different sizes
this is a great guitar strap for the money
mic it and you can play it anywhere
all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonablypriced tool
ive been buying gear from alto music since 1980
that bright sound can last about 6 months or more
second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it
its onoff switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which i never use
this is still my favorite pick for strumming
i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already
im not an overdrive player
the quality and feel of this tuner is very good
the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way
its a loud 15 watts
so i am a happy camper i did it right
this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way
i have kk pickups in other guitars
it sounded brilliant while it wasnt broken for about the 4 hours of runtime
but it will cover a good size room also
especially for the price range
if youre just wanting a toy go for it
update  been using these picks for a year since my first review
excellent tone and im a bit surprised by that
this is a nice pick holder especially for the price
the price for the replacement packets
they look great and were cheap
even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build
great picks for beginners and pros alike
it only cost around 60 so perfection should not be expected
looking to buy more soon
the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still
so 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction
when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully
they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound
so testing on their own mics
i must first state for the record i hate strap locks
so far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough
other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap
felt comfortable even with its larger size
ill get this one again
as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down
we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating
based on this belated realization i have raised the product rating to 4stars
i cant say enough good about this amp
this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it
not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar
i have a monster m rock12 cable
love the reverb in the fx section
perfect size for us big guys
for the money its really hard to beat
in this case the strings sound good
warm distortion and good controls
i have used for few times so i dont know about its longevity yet
the coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure
the lcd screen is bigger and overall very simple to use
this posilok miniboom is a nice clean look and is very functional
i would buy these again
i like that sharp thwack sound
i tune the a to 432 and this works well for that
i have absolutely no complaints
at least they wouldnt be able to put together a quality banjo
i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune
i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again
but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing
as a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks
mostly it goes in a pocket
i was surprised at the sound that this amp produces
its a foam cushion with a neck supporter
i have two sets of these for my straps
too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead
these will give any quitar a beautiful voice
but these for the price work fine
it will never hurt you it only helps
the bulkiness of this cabledoesnt seem to lend itself to easy coiling
im happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price
this little product is the perfect solution
what can i say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place
it is what it is and not much more
if you hear hum its not the shielding its your technique
it something nice to have around your house and work great
the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing
i cant let on what ive done to mine because
is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
it does a nice clean job for the recording i have gotten done
a single dot of superglue fixed that
students would be especially encouraged to get one of these
so i plugged it in and didnt really care for it
they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well
the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precisionmachined
just today i got the new tascam us100 usb audio interface
this bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly
its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists
taylor ships this guitar with these strings  and for a good reason
but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for
there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches
you will not be disappointed
i dont know the limit of overdubs but i havent reached it
one of the best purchases ive made for the money
all in all 4 stars
still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking
i find my left hand hitting the lever when im in open position
because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs
this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier
i ordered three of these
this is a great product
i love the flat low profile right angle plugs
there is better in this price range
like the title says ive been using these for years
this capo also has a pick holder
it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means
better go back to the diapason
but do yourself a favor and spend another 25 and get something better
they sound amazing and feel fantastic
i truly recommend it as a tuner pedal
as far as accuracy its right on in either setting
classic is a slightly lower gain more midboosted sound
i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed
i only paid 299 which is simply an outstanding deal
just trying to decide what speakers to purchase
this is made with a moveable arm between the tuner and the clip
would have been nice to have a few really long ones
for speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model
annoyance 2   this is a 20 watt amp right
great quality casters for the money
the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar
good  cable works for me using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch
martins are no doubt excellent strings
10 minutes it took for all 4 strings
none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall which is good right
would recommend this to anybody
i cant say what battery life is as only use withan ac adapter
very good tray to put small items
never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear
you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly
no more hunting for picks anymore
upper fret access is really good
the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should
the lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured
i like the right angle connectors
no issues to speak of
the nanowebs went on my 1970s guild d35
god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified
for me the guitar is not an everyday instrument
however the hot tubes completely transforms that tone
works fantastic and i am very happy with it
i have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades
works fine with my mixer
i have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me
it works really well and its really thin
not a slam on the productthats just the nature of the beast
see my review on the music stand
they just are not the sound i was looking for
elixir strings are very nice
these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing
wowif you need a guitar cable this is it
in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist
i did blues metal country and pop
i tried to tune it using a clampon snark tuner
it stacks well with the ep booster and another compboost in the chain too
you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
highly recommended and 5 stars
the price at amazon was the best i could find without buying used crap
the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree
the brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission
or any combo little amp
ive used this for about 3 months now
i will no longer use other humidifying methods for my br243a
they are a little flimsey but are ok
right out of the box this guitar was flawless
even the acoustic sound is majestic
i use it often but find it is not very accurate
notes are pretty mixed up and not separatedclear very loud though
thats because by themselves the athm50 dont have a flat frequency response
needless to say its not going anywhere
if youre tired of using batteries pick this thing up
i dont forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough
behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc9
most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb
this pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds  and is very versatile
im very happy with the purchase
for 7995 this is a must buy
it handles these without noticeable signal loss
this is ok if you are using a full boom that8217s facing the singer
no i am not affiliated with the company at all
hope this helps with your decision
you just dont get better service than this company provides
ive tried to like this pedal i really have
i love these hanging hercules guitar hangers
its so much better than my korg ca1
its good enough not expensive
the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well
looks better than the plain one
best i could find for this time of hard case
germany company manufacturing is in china
also the xlr connectors are of the highest quality
i love this now i dont have to find my pick
and its not that im cheap either
solidly built works just as a mic stand should
best money i ever spent
only thing i found was that  the pin rockrd a bit
i just decided to eat the loss
the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound
these are much more flexible so they last forever
i use there 100 30 and 25 cords and have never been disappointed
ive had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years
now im not a professional but this is just my opinion
sturdy and easyt to setup
greatly improved the tone over the stock sovteks that where in there originally
i have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons
the silver one is excellent and its made of aluminum not thermoplastic
the bad news is that this configuration is very buggy
this was a great choice and i couldnt be happier
like my first hosa cable this is a high quality item
be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less
the sound quality is amazing
and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled
and take your time and this device should work fine
i tried this with regular guitar but its not the same
i write and record my own music
5 stars and a nobrainer
this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be
this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique standalone sound
id say its a little expensive
they have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity
my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one thats easy
for home use it is fine
i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc
and roundwounds just didnt have that acoustic sound
love mine and have recommended to every musician i know
my father is a fulltime gigging musician primarily on steel guitar and telecaster
they break down faster than id like
the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison
i like tremolo but its virtually useless in this unit
yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster
still there is no reason to fear trying these elixirs out
they sound wonderful  right out of the box
i bought one and had the same experience
the boss me70 is easy to use
not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip
save your money and buy a better cable
my primary instrument is electric bass
i have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart
bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me
im very happy with the solid build
it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the onoff switch does nothing
thought it has to be so its out of the way
its smaller and lighter than the snowflakemore diminutive than the picture would suggest
the problem is its just not responsive enough
nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all thats needed
mod switch adds a perfect 34chorus34 effect for 80s metal ballads sound
i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years
i had issues with the packaging
but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long
recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue
if you want a really good sm58 clone i would recommend a behringer xm8500
this unit is very sensitive
there is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it
update  july 8 2012
the quick release and secure connection are great
stick to known brandslike shure ev at etc
but it youre looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities
i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic
these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag
025 width to the e string
i returned this because i wanted the script version instead
im opting for the convenience of the size
simply fantastic piece of equipment
as you lower it the support spreads out wide
who doesnt love these tuners
the black dunlop has a nice smooth finish
but it has the star for grip and that is super
great for all your needs
have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon
ive used the fx600 for a couple of years
strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around
the percussion loops are fine  at least provide solid guides for recording
ive used hosa for years they have never let me down
every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig
eq is to enhance your tone not create it
its an optical illusion but not a sign of higher quality instrument making
then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby
be prepared to purchase these in tandem
this stand really isnt an exception
really glad i tried it out
plugged into my 65 twin reverb not a reissue but the real thing wow
it just feels good in your hands
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
i can live with that
i would recommend this to anyone
ill post up a picture later
the range of this delay fortunately is quite wide
zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much
this is my first tuner in a long time and im please with it
shipping was fast and no problems
also check out hosas sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter
truly an amazing little gadget
this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used
again you will need a noise gate
great speaker stands well constructed easy adjustments for different setups
it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation
overall i give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars
i started with the flimsy grays
affordable and comes in many colors
this is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments
it really is a great product
i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now
bought it to hear how my harmonicas would sound amped
great for amateur vocal recording like me
something like this really should last at least a year or more
i use this pedal in my pedal chain
addendum 12132011if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection
over all i would not recommend this product
i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand
i wanted the tales of brave ulysses sound so i went with this
the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument
i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio
by the way the oldschool tweed look is a plus too
i prefer it to the 58 seems a bit more bright and natural
this is a great buy under 10 bucks for a quality cord
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
this capo comes with a pick holder
a couple tips to tuning a guitar  tune it like you play it
it was clearly a toy and i sold it for 25 without regret
with the sm7b you dont have to
i purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar
solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag
helps keep the products profile down a bit
ps  look at the price
im really glad i found this stuff
it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter
this pedal has a cool 1950s style  appearance
very durable and gets the job done
other than that i like it a lot
the leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit
totally happy with service and product
ill be damned if i put my 1000 guitars on these things
always add those rubber gasket strap stops too
a well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product
all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes
the led is really bright
i would purchase another if i needed it
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
i bought these black locks to go on a black stratocaster i built
this is the first delay that ive owned and im not looking back
i like another brand more because they feel a little more solid
yes you really replace your strings very fast with this winder
i really like the design
im just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool
i had this happen once
the shoulder rest is kinda useless though
capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary
but on my washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there
the build quality over the pod x3 live has improved
so load the picks up
they have a long cord and ill talk more about it later
goes one easy and feels sturdy
none has ever failed me so far
only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz
ill definitely continue to buy this brand in the future
and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string ive tryed
i have lots of friends who play these strings
this is a clean simple amp to use
these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too
it felt really small at first and i kinda was dissapointed
amazon support referred me to the manufacturer
re computers and drivers  almost all the tests went well
the tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks
it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost
this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before
the display colors are bright and easy to read
in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent
its quite expensive for 4oz
save your money this pedal is good enough
speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice
electrified banjo mandolin or violin
he really likes them a lot
and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own
great build quality works like it should
price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on
solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music
i recommend this little amp wholeheartedly
as a veteran bluseman i recommend it
because its not programmable im getting another
it is definitely worth the few extra bucks
its also lighter than the others mentioned which is a plus for traveling musicians
and this has been great to have an endless supply
sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks
i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product
until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them
i can get better string control compared to other strings
some nice picking with this pick
i was surprised when i tested this microphone
fyi  parchment is slightly off white
this is a very good general purpose strap
i have amps that have this feature that due a better job
lizzie wrote back and said shed take care of it
not a lot of white clipon tuners around
first time using item and it broke
it is well crafted and cheap
great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff
and as for the winder
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
if you play with nails and want finger picks these are for you
if you want a strap for 5 you cant expect the moon
there are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings
this should do well for you
planet waves makes good stuff
sure its old school rock distortion
you could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
if you have one or many expensive guitars buy these
then it had some stuck notes
it also looks great to talent in your studio
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product
they also seem to make a good clean sound
a good instrument is worth protecting
but anyways bottom line great unit for 2000 and sounds good very versatile
out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase
i saved 30 from buying another ac adapter that supports 240v
nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug
i chose these strings based on reviews i have read on the website
it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible
though it takes eq well and you can eq that in
type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome
surprised there are so few reviews
it has great sound and distorts like its suppose to
the only downside is the slight lack of bass
should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord
okay back to the explanation
the box is plastic but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate
at first i thought it was the noise suppressor
and the lace patriot red silver and blue value pack
this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal
the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow
good sound quality for not being bone
this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer
i have a small 714 hat size too
i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they dont disappoint
the sound was much nicer to my ears as well
even thoigh they work on many brands
they are the leader in new technology of strings
the strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition
terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly
what can i really say
ive seen more expensive cables and this one is so far great
con packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks
there are others on the market to be sure
i wonder how i ever lived without it before
i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic
wow does this stick or what
the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time
i just order 3packs so i can have some on hand
like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you
you really need a tuner for this step
i would certainly not tour with it
lcd is bright and clear and needleish display works as expected
first is the bass and treble controls
highly recommend the apogee jam
i played with light acoustic strings for a long time
good news   these aquila strings are on most new ukuleles
cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another
i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable
also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends
a flanger is also not really advisable
a web search will reveal countless workarounds
visually they dont appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings
yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference
it works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes
both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks
this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes
it fits tight but its fine
only issue they break easily
this blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole
i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size 8
it comes prestrung but it is out of tune
any number of mods can be found online to change the sound
worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter
i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another
replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue
hopefully a better make will put out something more roadworthy
these were things i could easily hear
sam ash was very courteous in fixing the problem
im unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it cant be undone
the design is simple and easy to understand and use
if youve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one
i would definitely recommend these
i removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit
it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay
the guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it
ive had one of these for about 2 years now
it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos
i love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals
there is no onoff clicking when depressed
very nice product great quality
basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer
ive tried others   always go back to ernie balls
this is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most
i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings
high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes
makes the bass sound pretty bad
looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss
the first did not have a compartment door
these are good cables at a good price
one can find info about mandolin setup on the web
mine didnt come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though
this one works better than anyone i have tried
for value and use as a wee pa its a 5 star deal
while i didnt need volume this little guy can be loud
overall nice looking feeling guitar for a beginner
a 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal wont power it
bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome
tight on some not on others
the repeats are long and do not sound artificial
simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it
im very happy with it and it works great without any problems
but overall its a great product
time was when that was all there was
surprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it
these strings do not last less time than the elixirs
out of most ive tried ive come across the big muff the most
the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist
i get a much higher output  much better response and much better sound
for a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat
it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument
well i found out he uses a 990 as well
and a note about the looks
i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one
about half have worked great the other half have this odd little issue
battery life isnt super but satisfactory
well packaged for shipping arrived 1 day early fair quality
ive bought much more expensive cable that didnt have the quality of these
i much prefer a brighter more chimey sound
i bought two of these one for each of my sons 12 and 14
one spots come with an 8pedal multi plug
item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging
like all of dunlop products this worked great
you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen
also there is no driver supplied by the company
one minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least outofthebox
its a hangup of mine
i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake
its probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes
well its a cloth and i use it to wipe my guitar
ive never found it to be excessive
i zero the spring verb and use the pedals onboard reverb for best results
this is not a pick for windmilling guitarists
it has about six knobs
works great with or without polish
the legs make this thing very very wide
easier learning bagpipes than these things
ive been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks
clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect
upon comparing the resulting  cds
i hope its analog but theres nothing about it in the documentation
playing weekinds and practicing they last a long time with the same sound quality
i know ive owned another set for more than twenty years
think i ordered it twice
i will probably pick up a white cotton strap
until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency
it is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs
been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else
this is my second fender polish cloth
bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine
daddario exp16s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used
its for bedroom use only
the sound is not as crisp
found the guardian at amazon and thought for 10 how could i go wrong
but thats where the similarities end
its cheap light simple and does its job
bbe soul bender  my least favorite vibe
much cheaper online too for the price its a steal
two fender american standards gibson es335
they securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely
i was looking for a semisoft felt picks
im a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it
the stiffness is just due to preference
so the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens
there is pretty much little to no latency and it isnt noticeable
i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price
i play often and like to change strings often
i like the choice of colors too
this was so inexpensive i couldnt pass it up
the pedal comes with a 9 volt battery
for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup
its got some good features although i dont use them
it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up
if youre a purist dont ever use a pedals or even electric guitar
this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv
avoid if you can spend more
you cant view the snark sn4 at any kind of sharp angle
ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day
i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin
can i hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones
buy it you will never regret
easy to install and works like a charm
also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands
certainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal i have used
i will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future
a heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged
this board is great no sliders which i had to clean
overall im extremely pleased with my purchase
definitely would purchase again solid quality build
plus behringer is the best brand for pedals
ive turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy
i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware
expect to pay 5 to 6 for a replacement battery
the bottom clamp never did secure properly
and rockisland sound sends it out fast
this is a good stand
i also have a danelectro  fab echo and this just blows it away
stretch them bend them and they dont break
just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water
a real money saver a very smart buy
will buy it again in the future
here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller 1 bulky
the taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should
pros  fits on any guitar
an integrated flip out kickstand would make this perfect
nothing more to say but it said i needed 1 more word
its key to not get too much tension
even works on a standup bass
this little guy does all it needs to do
i got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall
that was surprising since its a usb mic
despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely
im still in search of the perfect set of strings
this amp is cool and unique
ive been playing for about 17 years
moment from time to time  more falls into place
much more sturdy than it appears in photos
good item for the price
as for the replaceable reed plates
with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use
when i got it in it didnt work
like always dimarzio products are simply the best
ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you
the rubber feet are also smaller
recently i was building a telecaster project
ive used these most of my life and will continue to
i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service
they are easy to install
and holds all strings down completely and easily
another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass
nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too
i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there
hopefully this review will be usefull to you
alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like hendrix
win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes
its heavy but it in a good way
it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts
these are well worth the money
one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type
i wish this stuff had been around when i first started playing
power switch is on the back
its a switchless pedal that i put through hell
quite sure its the same model
i only just received these but thought id give my first impression
i wish it was made in america
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
the stand is very stable and works well
for a while i had the sn5 tuner
these strings sound nice and you cant go wrong with the price tag either
for now im hanging one on the wall with this and its fine
as the protector ages it slips off the end
the product works very well im able to power 5 of my pedals easily
this one fills the bill pretty well
first of all i love the crybaby 535q and i recommend this wah pedal
theyre dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound
authentic replacement screws if you need them
i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible
dont even think about it
save your money and get some harps that actually work
if you strum  play softly then pluck  tune each string softly
got this for my electric guitar
if you are on a budget get one
that means you have more green stuff to buy other things
i definitely would say this is a musthave
the real treat is the tone switch
yet it is a capo structured very well
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
the seller did not fail me in any way
a definite improvement on a classic stompbox
i use it with home recording and it is great for my needs
this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality
they are very flexible easy to handle and of good quality
it is wide and has leather ends
you dont need the hype
it seems to hold tight
still enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use
both mac and windows are supported
i use it at practice and during our live shows
the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move
so is that like 20 hail marys for that confession
so far they seem awesome
i only wish digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper
fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky
i plugged it in the outlet
the case is awesome too
has a tuner and a metronome
i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand
this was a terrific deal
these strings are the best all around for tone clarity punch and volume
i have a strap ordered and on the way
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
thick non scratch foam is a plus
thanks to amazon for the quick delivery
this model is the lowest priced but youre buying a reputable brand
and for many its all thats required
id buy these again in a heart beat
this pedal seems older as well
if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it
the glass is a much softer more subtle sound than metal
ive plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too
build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten
stays in tune very well
i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around
great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it
several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it
and it mikes well too by the way
great quality very strong and great variation of length on them
when you do 6 out of 10 times the plastic socket will break
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
ive installed them on every fender i own
i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too
easy in and out with velcro retaining strap
we live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals
the notes are slightly difficult to bend but the reeds are still loosening up
ok ill add a star your right i should add a star
i have played full time for over 27 years
these strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time
this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too
this is just good common sense
this is the american dj micro galaxian red  green laser
it also lacks 14 plug one rca input you need an addapter
what a great aframe stand especially for the money
before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen
they work fine for me
i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably
i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar
the fg 700s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
its a great deal buy it
filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup
these are value cables after all
steel strings only  does not apply to nylon or gut strings
at the time the ac2s were selling for about 85 new
i will say that its very easy to play
others found this to be true too
i think the product should have been around 7080
the cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew
for example im playing with the harmonica now
just clip it onto the bridge
sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price
it doesnt cause any problem with the products performance
does that make me a gear snob
they look nice and are easily worth their selling price
i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way
is this the best distortion pedal
a nice addition to my recording home studio
also use these on my taylors
i would put this pedal in that category
bought this instead and it plain rocks
i ordered a ts 6v6 and am still waiting for it
8 guitars now are fitted
great case didnt really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about
they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced
you pay twice as much in a store
im a new user but seem to be a great product
put em in your case and dont be unprepared
it is a great idea and worth the cost
after using daddario strings ive try to ernie ball strings
save your money and time
the picks are pretty comfy to hold
the cutter works great you just have to be careful
really this is a keeper
this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable
any flaws would be quite noticeable
just had to unfold it
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
made in usa a very good price
going from manual patchlevel to banklevel is awkward
this nylon pick has great play feel
i mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is
i assure you its crapware and beware
snark tuners have always performed well for me
if the knob ever breaks they are a very easy replacement at radio shack
it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins
its built like a brick and durable as all getout
dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with
i like the look of it as well as the lightweight feel
no bite to it at all
the clamp is strong enough that it will stay put
they are also very easy to use and 34install34
knobs were hard to see settings
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar
this thing is fun to play with
i only have one minor complaint
the strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets
this thing stands up nicely on all three
not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie
after confirming the guitar was okay i tried a shorter cable which worked fine
i prefer shars overture premieres which are the same price
same with treble bass volume and all other effects
i am now 57 so i have a few years of experience
these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb dont sqeek
for those players bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars
its like im using actual studio monitors
it cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid
i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year
i use carbon zinc batteries in mine
it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful
however for the price and purpose this a five star cable
when using with a computer but they dont
might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasnt done by shipping
i like this cable for it has an angled plug
spend a few more dollars it is worth it
it is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream
the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product
great product for the price
but the material is awesome
it flows in sweeps like
the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable
it worked with my windows 7 starter acer netbook
the display is very stable and its simply fun and easy to use
would recommend picking up a new one when you order
good breadth of tonal variations available
i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights
again nothing that cant be fixed with other effects
mxr make pretty good pedals for the money
there is a reason they are used by so many professionals
the item does what its supposed to
wow best ever in this category
so you are getting what they say
extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems
i decided to try out the powergrip and have been extremely impressed
i dont expected nothing better this is just right
having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings
accurate with tv on in the background
have no problems with this
this mic is good considering the price
this is a pretty decent guitar
so far this cable has worked very well
it is short but works with the small amp that i purchased
this pedal lives up to the hype
best 90 i have ever spend
i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar
does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise
these guitar strings are very nice and i love them
it requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time
theres some element of nostalgia with the ds1 that ive just never understood
you have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere
this strap fits right feels good and looks handsome
so yeah best of luck with that
i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation
it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at hp level
i am happy with it
ive never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is
i have lots of tuners and several brands of clip ons
would recommend this brand to anyone
sound very good and for the price it cant be beat
at less than 30incl shipping its a steal
i didnt like the switches on the cad m179 either
this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded
better to have a little bit of extra length than too short
dont get this if you have man hands
i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price
on these i use the lights9s
much better than the one i received with a guitar i ordered
great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f335 perfectly
the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones
your option to change the wah configuration is amazing
it  weighs only 25 pounds 109kg so its portability is very good
i recently built a bass myself and i install this one
with not much left i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro
it proved to be very functional
you cant beat the price
get yours while you can at this price
it is light sort of cheap etc
the cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well
the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 34 size ether
i keep it on all the time since it always improves soundquality
i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster
the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges
im convinced even heavier loads will be no problem
go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing
put it to work making music within minutes
also this was priced right in my opinion
i bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases
absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp
they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone
it has a durable metalic case
protects my string from dna
hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation while lowering our labor costs
i realy like the cutter
but its sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job
its not perfect but neither am i so 5 stars would recommend to anyone
gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether
overall i like the design and flexibility
the acoustic guitar quick release system is very interesting
i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet
i use these on a deering goodtime ii and they work well
dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players
also the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer
however if you need a lot of pedal space read the dimensions
its a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection
dont put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years
i first picked up a transducer for about 3 and experimented
what can i sayi love this thing
tried them on epi lp and a prs
these mediums work well for playing electric guitar
it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe
as long as you get one that works
plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action
if its short of center the string is flat
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
i have no issues with quality or feel its too loose
ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings
hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty
this is a nice part
this is a great capo
my eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo
i know it can do standard tuning i just cant figure it out
i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy
i would recommend these to anyone
606060 be warned this review may not help you
works great for podcasting vocals or anything else you want to record
display is very easy to read and lights up nicely
the review below is wrong
its important to you to know the diameter of your guitars soundhole
over all for the cost you cant go wrong
i tried the soft and medium wedgies but both were just too soft
i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this
just got this in this week
as other reviewers have indicated a squier bullet
this item did the job its made for
both models cost about the same with the pm05 roughly 20 cheaper
this is better i think
but its not the reason why i drop by one star
other people will love them though
and im an adult so i can be careful
and out of all of them i like the snark the best
i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box
these are very bright and clean
it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that
save your money and steer clear of this one
more than enough decay and wetness
when i play faster songs thick gauge picks are very easy to lose
this is especially true for the g string
the thing is dense and build solid as a rock
but works perfect for me
sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side away from me the player
good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment
i bought them for home use only
if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins
the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
easy to build and breaksdown for transport
these have the sweetest tone for batterybased abuse
i used it on a first act me501
they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming
this is a very useful little device
just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds
i dont know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not
the depth knob does its job
final blurb  my feelings about this amp are mixed
having said that i dont like them as much as a regular nylon pick
good quality and thik cussion
this tuner is amazing even more so considering the price
its good for keeping things from getting too buzzy
when the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works
i have found that everything schaller makes is grade a1 in my book
these are exactly what the doctor ordered
2 all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit
for the price these cant be beat
i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead
strings theyre all i use on my acoustic
for guitars its not as good as hercules
this is one of the cleanest sounding miniamps youll find
well long story short this is my fourth vox wah
i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely
very good sound quality plenty of gain
heavy duty and nice looking
its good overall but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me
why have to remember to carry spare batteries
i take it everywhere and it has never let me down
extra light gives good action for my small guitar
but its not a 5star cable
all the proline shure mics are top quality
i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem
our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack
the these strings are fantastic
i was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this
to your guitar amp or from it
of course the board is layed out a little differently
i give it just 4 stars though due to its design
but for a small woman with small hands its difficult to operate
and the ukulele looks so much better now
daddario always makes great products at great prices
and the price it right
this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described
i have however had a slight issue with certain d strings
nice bag with great features
the cable material is very bendable and easy to work with
the onboard monitor volume and headphone is fantastic
best inexpensive right angle cables out there
i am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands
i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone
i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar
again someone will chime in and bash me for saying this
i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps
its quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily
i thought why not try a 2 in 1 formulation
it does not tell your boss to give you a raise
it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp
minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some bright strong mids
thats what the fender is for
i used a 38 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully
id recommend this over the larger tubular type
i own a few of them
its an easy oninseconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets
i love the red the swivel head the green
double bass pedal has a quality build
hes very happy with this purchase
the ability to modify with fuse is an additional layer of gravy
the bad monkey overdrive pedal does not produce crazy train metal distortion
i just glued it to my pelvis
qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins
and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us 100 worked
love the coil love the price
only two things to gripe with  1
im looking to upgrade after a month
dont expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you wont be disappointed
but aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound
the more aggressive recording level solved that problem
arrived as expected and as described
i listen to music about 3  4 hours a day
i have no complains about it
all have their good and bad points
considering what you get for the price
solid state just isnt the same
i am able to see my music
until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane  aha
its well worth the money
the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
it is also small and portable
1 digital drumset 1 electronic guitar 1 microphone non xlr and a keyboard
it certainly wont be for everybody but so far i like what i hear
they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably
i use delay pretty light n tight  slapback vibe not too wet
the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours
ill bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out
i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for 6 strings
so far no problems at all
i am pleased with my purchase
i wouldnt touch anything but fender mediums for years and years
ive been using this product for many years
but on first play it pleasantly surprized me
good idea but it doesnt work
this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped
i play 12 nights a week in a midiassisted duo
i love these carry bags
it has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks
it got here fast and was trackable
even the pop filter fell off
for the price i have no complaints at all
however theyre definitely still usable after that
i use to protect my microphones
it looks amazing in use
stout stable and even looks good
it doesnt require a loud volume to hear the tone
i use this capo all the time on both instruments
i play blues jazz and bluesy rock
this cable simply feels strong and well made
you cant beat the price
this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar ok
for the money you cant beat it
it was cheap to buy but works just fine
im betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it
i have very similer straps that have lasted 30 years
not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise
this is a standard 3824 threading tap
over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand
the only issue was with some manufacturing detail
what about the stock pick guard
the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind
sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics
does fine on hard floors
it is flexible yet stationary
i have five guitars including two les pauls and they hold them just fine
after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better
i then tried one on my breedlove custom revival om with poor results
it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife
so i tried this monster cable
were not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitar
i reattached the item and added a windscreen
this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new
good to keep as a spare in the gig box
then i got into guitar building and they all got put away
this music package by led zepplin is historical and put together well
the only thing i didnt like about these
because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable
its speaker is a 10 inch 8ohmspecial design fender
the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff
i own 3 now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection
which is not expected at this price point
the planet waves oports gives me that extra
i dont in anyway blame the seller
small but well lighted screen
expect less for that price
in fact i sold the delay and slow mo recently
is good to play rithyms but cant do pretty much nothing else
there is no better modeling amp for my needs
it also is feature loaded but with one kicker
its just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper
its definitely the best verb its price range
i also wish that this specific came in another color other than black
i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin
this is a great microphone
i will be buying more in the future
very satisfied with this one
they are not slippery which helps
its got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust
still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old
bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot
the destortion works well enough
its best on a stand 34 feet off the ground
in particular i favor the dual design
not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
010 sets and they are good too
other than that for the price its just awesome
but thats exactly what i need to clean and protect my fretboard
really a remarkable microphone for around 100
that way i can look from a distance
i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great
they last a long time
very good for a quick tune up
the height is easily adjustable and the shelf tilt is easy too
please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut
so i am not the authority
these clips are 116 in
get one youll be happy you did
classical and acoustic steelstring guitars are also a tad problematic too
i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track
he was right  great product
these picks are great the best part is the 72 pack
i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything
this tuner blows away my old guitar professorqwik tune tuner
but its just not a good product
simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed
with guitars crappy strings kill it
it doesnt cut the bass out
my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using
im not much for brand names on my guitar cases
get a few just in case but i am still on my first
for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules
i threw  out my gibson spray
great mic for the price
it is highly informative easy to follow and has some good songs in it
maybe those folksshould shell out an additional 300 for something better
you dont need to spend big money for tubes
with the xedit you call up a canned sound and start changing it
in the end its definitely worth the 120 i spent on it
and it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my ta50r
like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points
dont buy these if you have a large thumb
one cannot go without having one for the price
this is incredibly easy to use right out of the package
faster and more stable tuning
the exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending
i wish my car dash looked like this thing
i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here
restringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread
please memorize this  chandler guitars pickguard heaven
its very light and thin sounding
probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide
good service product packing and delivery time
this was a christmas gift from my husband
great deal on great strings
i expect the pick to wear down from use
i did a little experiment
folds up and can easily be stored
matte flat black finish is nice
quality sounding and durable for a great price
i truly recommend this one spot adapter to everyone
make sure thingie outputs at least500 ma if you can
i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair
i bought three and am purchasing 3 more
this is not just a tuner  its a peacekeeper for our band
it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in
the tone is clear and bright
so far i am very happy with these strings
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it
this is a nice strap
really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality
i switch acoustic strings 34 times a month on my 2 main guitars
sensitivity is good and im very pleased by this purchase
hard not to like that
maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action
they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate
i didnt have any problems with either of the three supplied cables
out of the 4 i have it only liked 2
the sn2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn1 doesnt
it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal
going to pick up the optional foot switch
but this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls
bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from
but otherwise worth the price and a good doodad to have around
solid nice sound very good quality to make anyone happy except your neighbors
i built a custom cabinet and installed this baby
there is a tone circuit bypass switch that i do not fully understand
it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it
however behringer makes a distinction between the c1 and the c1u
this is my second sm48 in 25 years
the best part is its not at all complex to learn the features
i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great
this is intended to replace a mim 6 screw stratocaster bridge
it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off
but theyve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me
these are good but different
the korg is the perfecttuner
cheap easy to use cuts sound 70
not worth lowering to 4 stars though
this hanger was very easy to install
i know people who have the marshall and the fender
this amp would sell for double the price tag
it stopped working after 2 gigs
5 stars just for service
i finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through amazon
anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic
i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings
i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables
my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds
they sound good to me
i hate overprocessed guitar tones
for the future i am not so sureabout me
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric736 lbs
as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same
with a little sanding this fit my fender american strat perfectly
easy to withdraw and replace picks
the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel
leaves board clean and fast
i didnt expect this cable to be so thin
just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic
ive 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsthe intellitouch is simply champion
but i will never do that and neither will you
this product seems to be a pretty good product
the hd sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great
i am super impressed with this little thing
the extortion here is almost monster cable like
easy to assemble and feels very solid
they snap right in carry sound well and come with a lifetime warranty
need a all n one tuner buy this or an iphone
wow it really did make a huge difference
also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys
i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else
ive only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well
this is what is giving the deeper sound
feels good to switch positions solid and quiet
what surprised me was how it improved the sound
with proper care im confident these cables will last a very long time
but come on this stuff is just fine
the spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high
wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables
adjustment is easy and effective
the string cutter is very handy
you cant honestly ask for more
there is no way i would use these
so no hope of expanding
hangers adjust to required width of head stock
it can be confusing during the first time i used it
the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator
gives you virtually unlimited sustain
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars
this a great instrument cable
the set is quite nice for the price
they are some of the best drum sticks ive played
it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze
mine came stock with a jj tubes 12ax7
no fret buzz and i just love the feel of the neck
goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks
i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained
aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal
its long enough to allow my bass to rest at arms length
nothing else i can say  take it for cheap guitars
this pedal is very nice
its ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected
if not this one at least buy some kind of cleanerpolish
i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths
cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and dont break
i will buy one of these again
it feels a bit cheap but then it is cheap
use very little of this
do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings
does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop
he found just what he needed and at a great price
they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure
so far the tuner is very accurate
i never realized how dry the wood was
you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
have been very happy with them
they said well mine was only 45 and mine was only 40
the missing38 of an inch is a minor detail
i am extremely happy with this product
it was priced right  750 usd
for under 10 and prime eligible what more can you ask for
sm58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high
its too flexible almost like twizzlers no kidding
these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better
yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect
this is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should
this is a great guitar case and a great price
all three of my kids have a guitar
i got two of them
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy
only downside is i think the nashville capo looks better
i feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better
what do they call medium or small
the only reason this is not a 5star review is because of the drings
it works well at all heights
mine arrived broken so it had gone back
good strings with good sound
the 2 important things are not in bullet  the sustain and the sound
well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo
i love the tone of this pick striking strings
this isnt 1960 get an upgrade already
one other thing it works better if you put it in front
i wanted an amp that would have overdrive and i also wanted some power
earnie balls guitar strap locks are great
i havent seen much more expensive ones with these features
however thats me and ymmv as they say on the internet
i dont and they arent for me
the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again
at least these guys listen
nice big lugs to solder to
the quality is fine and it does what its supposed to do
this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling
it stays in place beautifully
this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot
easy to use and makes changing out strings easy
this one is comfortable for 10 mins then its cramp time
the differences here between the sn8 and sn1 are quite noticeable
take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean
ive bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet
this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it
i would recommend these cables and will buy again
dual track with lowhigh volume sliders
my primary concern is  how does the pedal sound
hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully
but i guess you cant have it all
this product does what it is designed to do very very well
im not really a corksniffer re  guitar tone
the ability to adjust treb and bass is nice
i have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic this being the second acoustic
bought it to replace strings for my taylor
i want them to be slick when i bend notes
many great features including an onthefly samplerlooper
the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it
im sure there are better ones but for me this works well
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
you now have a quick release strap holder
having said that for a 40 bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me
but after they stretch out a little they sound perfectly fine
the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well
they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass
this product is not what it seems
as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings
the angle of the tray is not adjustable
just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on
ease of use is tops ever
this cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect clean sound
my capos include bird of paridise paige and kyser
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy
daddario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time
i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing
no good out of the boxplug it nothing
adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard
still seems to be good quality
my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made
every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me
i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too
i can fit all of my 34stuff34 into the many pockets as well
besides it wont look this good
ive never heard a bad tone out of mine
these are my favorite strings to use on my american strat
but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording soundonsound
ive used boutique strings for many years but always come back to these
gotta love those new external usb power nodes
seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound
the dials and everything was easy to understand
all the pitch shift settings sound like theyre 30 cents sharp
i love the design and the strap holds up very well
and is much better quality
i am a tone freak
2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly
the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly
i also purchased a musicians gear   http www
finger slides are much harder with these strings
inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune
the h4n is a work horse
i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised
i purchased the us600 specifically for the 34detune34 effect
im back to programming menus again ugh
sorry os2  its pawnshop time for you
i dont think you should drop it very often
this is a prime instrument
its a well crafted instrument
ive even put them in a vice and filed new points on them
the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief
49 for a 199 microphone at amazon
i replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar
this mic fits my studio need perfectly
if youre expecting an sm57 then buy an sm57
the neat freak in me hates that
this is probably the least useful part of the amp
i lose picks so easily i needed a pick hold
i have another headstock tuner that ive had for awhile
the bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge
they are suitable for rock punk country and funk
it comes with clips that can be used for other tablets
thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar natural
i purchased as a practice amp
bonfires sitting around the house etc
this pedal is solidly built and works as advertised
like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it
also each instrument is different each peg is different
really efficient way to go in my opinion
theres a reason all pros use metal
i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass
side by side the mxr won hands down
black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
a very nice pick both in feel texture and design
i like the  setting the best
i have an epiphone es339 and recently put these strings on it
all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable
what more do you need
overall this is a very good capo and i can recommend it without hesitation
if yours has this problem send it back while its still in warranty
the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes
i love the pads and the knobs
i love it and i am using it almost every single day
push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep
a string is in tune when the rings stop rotating
the tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings
this is an awesome capo
ok theyre a little odd but for the price i dealt with it
who doesnt need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right
it really seems well engineered and made of quality material
she thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials
sadly the volume only goes to 10
it distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though
as another guy said 34how could i live without this pedal before
loved the fender super champ probably the best but there wasnt a headphone jack
the mustang iv is the same as the iii but with 150watts
so think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional
but thats not enough now a days
these  picks  r awsome
i find i do better with heavy thickness
this boss pedal just didnt work that well for me
this is my 3rd set of cables i ordered from amazon
i cant remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff
put a battery in and plugged it in
i think the price is a little high for what it is
it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals
its a wah and wah and does just that
i decided to try the guardian and save a few bucks
this is the best invention since the wheel as far as im concerned
ridiculous setup but ive save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that
10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp
the input 14inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid
one of the cheapest prices on amazon
i got the sound i wanted
thats the sound ive been looking for out of this amp
a great choice for the price
the locking mechanism is strong
i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele
very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs
as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove
delay on tuning low e string2
most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians
60s ive been using them for years and so will probably never change
buy one  youll like it
so this is some good stuff
the thing is they get to be a bit overwhelming at least to me
i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks
there are other excellent strings available
ive owned this pedal for about 8 years
great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar
the jacks are high quality construction
frankly im not a fan of most onboard effects with combo amplifiers
since then ive been through a multitude of guitars and strings
for solos itll boost your mids and your signal
grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard
case in point  pure nickel strings
no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing
this strap is perfect for those needs
i used to use fender medium picks only
15 days later it finally arrived
you can simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel
youll wonder how you ever played without it
it makes a great temporary hard shell case
you need at least 60 db of gain the spec sheet actually says 59
it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books
they also have pretty colors
as you move the distortion knob higher the sounds gets more and more animal
behringer gave me a link to download
been uning them for years
non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick
my old mic just wasnt cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface
its a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well
i know some will disagree
nope but they sure do sound good
unlike every other music stand ive used that one can simply force into position
grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack
they grip your head snugly without that horrible 34vice grip34 feeling
felt just like the day it arrived from the factory
but i like it so far
yes this may be another tube screamer clone but its a darn great one
i would recommend for sure
i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option
the tuning is deadon and couldnt be more convenient
if you use any fingerboard treatment try this one
so far im very pleased with the jam
dont use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase
i like these strings for their warm  mellow tone
mediumheavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold
quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch
this pick holder works for me
my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism
these headphones are wonderful to wear
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound
the daddario exl110bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great
ive been playing guitar for 40 years
my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it
to get those flawless professional sounds
i am finally feedback free
ill never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this
it is so small that it cannot hold all mics
it has two brightness settings
some i might not use but there are plenty i will use
by now in contrast i would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones
these are the best strings ever
other wise you are shifting the clean signal
this came in the mail today in a rather large box
i am going to look for a decent one
but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open
stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time
as it stands i give them 45 stars
these have a nice sound
i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar
i put these on all of my guitars
this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there
i like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar
what looks like a spring actually is a spring
its very easy to install very straight forward to use it
well obviously that depends on the strap
this pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave
not only that but they sound great
not the greatest mic cable but for the price they cant be beat
the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
i think youll be satisfied
i have several types of capos this one seems well built
if you want a tuning challenge the low bass e string is it
i wanted to experiment with a thin pick
it would have 5 stars but for the recent failures
im sure it can be done using the fuse editor
with distortion it sounds great
so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help
i was very impressed by this little guitar
we use it to hold the musics and dont need to turn the head
makes my crappy behringer amp sound
for the price its amazing
these are all your presets which many amps are doing these days
new fail update  the tremolo in this unit just stinks
it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker
this is fun and easy to do
again it works perfectly for my situations
do not use these to polish your guitar
now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice
i like the unique pattern on this thing too
otherwise i use this cable at every show
this device is the best you can buy
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes
i didnt hammer the strings just played easy mostly the eagles
good strong spring and good strong materials
you cant go wrong with monster cables
i was not happy with the sound of these strings
it is a little loud
too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation
my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets
also i like the first day of new strings look shiny
it holds your picks and sticks to your guitar
works well for my needs
the behring us600 is a basic pitch shifter dont expect elaborate effects
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
for me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same
i cant stop using it
its only a guitar hanger
seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason
nice cable could be a little heavier
great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic
its has a deep overdrive
top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon
the tone is much bettter too
stay away dont fall victim to the noob hype
also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning
on off switches on each
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and theyre just bad
some people think its the power supply but nobody knows for sure
after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning
since i did not see similar comments from others perhaps mine is not representative
would i buy it again
i may order another if this one performs well
i did manage to get it on
it is all i want or need from a stand
dont let the offbrand name put you off
011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil
says so right in the manual
you wont be disappointed with this amp
back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone
i would recommend going a little higher price
im very satisfied with my purchase
if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better
take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music
i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help
will do the job of good protection
a must for any gigging guitarist
only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly
it is as good looking in person as in the pictures
love them and theyre good quality picks too so i will use them
sound great and look great
its probably not the product thats described here
this is a very reasonable price for this bag
a nonbuiltinbuiltin tuner at this price cannot be beat
or at least i think so
does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type
with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff
ive had several cases and this is one of the nicest
i would have much better liked it if they were metal
yes this pedal is made of plastic
the cutter worked great too
it does seem like it can deal with some wear and tear
and you cant dial it out
very nice classical guitar strap
ahhh this is a guitar strap
what to do with it
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
what these picks are good for is leads
you wont find that in anything else under 300
there is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about
these take less room  and cut down on the clutter
it was an exceptional guitar for which i paid 125
u wont be happy either
does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units ive used
other than the price the strings work great on my guitar
is the mini sent from heaven
i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics
i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable
since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them
nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box
buy it youll like it
this microphone works well for our needs
theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedals
then see how long you can own it
and all for 7 bucks w prime shipping
now im in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers
i had it up and running in a few minutes
the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone
but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs
the supplier refunded some of the postage
ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life
would buy again should the need arise
this is a very nice cable for the price
the small footprint is nice for those with limited space
i figured she pretty much got what she paid for
it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability
also with my win7 x64 machine
it does all of those jobs well
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15
im pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny
its a pretty cool little gizmo
its kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because its stiff
this brings us to the 4th and most expensive zoom the h4n
midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine
good for rockabilly and 50s slap echo
printed documentation is pretty lame but the included dvd is more through
the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck
the martins are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball
there is little to fault with it
these are a little brighter than reds and are best for live playing
buy its bigger brother the us366
love this amp and ive shopped every comparable model
i like many things about this tuner
i notice mixed reviews here
it cost me 2090 with shipping
on my wifes a style mandolin it fits but barely
my son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more
that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing
not impossible but not terribly convenient either
works perfect for guitar strings
overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume
i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up
would i purchase this again
i decided to give it a good set up
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings
i thought that if its made by hohner it must be fairly good
ive got a mxr mc404 cae for my concert line pedals
go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogoogle
i bought this strap because i thought the pattern was awesome
they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive
the best sound i got was on my lp
the strings are very good
imho you dont need a click switch
quality and price im just satisfied
this proves that easy helps
obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad
i didnt realize everything else this pedal can do
tuners old style not sealed
it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings
this set of daddario chromes is remarkable
if you gig or record and need a reverb
takes you hours to play around with all the sounds
this guitar strap performs as expected for its price
this pedal makes my les paul sing
he loved them all and wont quit playing with them
xlr cables are hard to mess up
im now a convert too
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part
unless you just dont like daddario i would recommend these strings highly
ive never had one of these move from where i left it
i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me
only the machine heads are somewhat smaller
would like to see stereo output options in future models
ive not broken one yet and the 1148 is a good gauge
but this wouldnt be a very good review without having some cons
im very pleased with the unit
luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these
i feel 100 secure that my guitar will not fall
theyre very small about the size of a nickle so youve been warned
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
the drivers gave me no hassle installing and as i said above rock solid
in addition to the standard dampit theres a soundhole cover
the design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud
i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg
i am pleased with the strap and the low price
the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig
that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive
overall a great little deal for the price
the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on
i would buy it again
jj seems to have a smoother sound than most
i would recommend it to others to try
with phantom mic its well done
the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp
i sent it back probably due to my ignorance
when i want a more gentle muted tone i use dandrea pro 346
im using this with five pedals and it works great
i use this for my desk mic i use for recording
and why is the lineout so darn noisy
i bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project
doesnt get any easier than that
my washburn d30s will never leave home without one
the sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost
havent used this one yet
if you dont have a preamp system this will do you no good
i dont think its true bypass either
after a dunlop lock failure i decided to change over
i used to use those old stretchy things
the guys prove that the hype was legit
it gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs
3 of which are actually output latency so this is really impressive
the overdrive is quite good
i came across these grovers
they fit perfectly and are of high quality finish
the sm57 will pop like mad without one
update  121912still working great after 5 months
these stay connected but arent so wide that they change the style of picking
wellconceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks
this worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet
it is a simple compressor thats it
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock
for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this
i remembered 34eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie34 and just tuned away
the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest
you receive 3 felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick
this is a great guitar for the money
im a huge fan of daddario strings
piece of plastic with no bracing
plenty loud for your bedroomofficewhatever
it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back
it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy
feels sturdy enough and its adjustable for a man of any size
hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually
this is a great tuner
it winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter
other than that the product works asadvertised
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products
its also more than just a dp008 with more tracks
the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly
i havent heard a hint of feedback and the onoff switch is a plus
overall this is a really good bargain for an extra backup or kids mic
the seat is generously padded and is 25 inches thick
this little amp will sound great
they are easier to bend too which is great
this modtone here seems solidly constructed
i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar
not only is it interferencefree it has a much warmer intimate sound
but fat or skinny daddario makes some of the best strings out there
ends are made of leather
they mate perfectly with 14 receptacles on guitars and amps
this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars
now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me
i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time
manual should have been include not sure about the cord
its no peavey but it works just as good
thought i would give them a try
its very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits
ive tried many and these are the best by far
the sound is great good balance between highs and lows
you can count on me for future purchases
but wait a minute hold the phone
this is what gives them their charm and voice
it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp30
between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered
i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner
theres no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song
but the sound is awesome
means only that dr 40
a lot of fun and meaningful
being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either
it has held up with all the kids using it
20 plus years and still working
it gets you in the ballpark but just barely
this was an impulse buy
i will report on that
i will try to get a replacement
i use mixcraft pro 6 and its working well
the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone
it is not too short as one reviewer complained
its essentially a 9v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light
this is my first electric tuner
in this respect its like an mxr 6 band
also this tuner is tiny
when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly
the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam
not a bad product just dont know how long it will last
see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool
i dont think it would hold up long on stage at a venue
not many frills to this bag
i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar
it can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion
maybe not the best but it serves its purpose
wow  it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities
they are high quality great durablity and a great price
the first 3 saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down
it is essentially three parts  the base and two removable arms
theres nothing else to say but to get it if you need it
too soon to tell if the sn8 will hang in there
if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing
very nice resonant and clean
everything on it is very adjustable which i also like
over the years ive tried literally dozens of capos
the result is quite appealing
however these definitely arent reliable gigworthy tuners
im a 62 yo newby to guitar
in fact i am pretty impressed
the gold finish matches my instruments hardware and they are sturdy and durable
my go to strings from now on
i gig 12 times a month
but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster
im extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound
you  might pay more for a name brand case
i will buy these strings until the day i die
the mark tremonti wah is great
the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well
allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone
also the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated
that really worked well to tune the guitar
i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceasedbad dexterity
just sounds flat and boring
i connected it with mixer alesis 8 input
there are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers
the orig still the best
well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele
wish it was better made
looks great on my blond tele
taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers
all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort
low cost strap lock that works on most guitars buttons
everything you need to know is in the title
well it fits the rode m1 mic i was using nice and tight
this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as im concerned
i have been playing guitar for 30 years and these are the best
this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
i bought a couple of these two years ago
kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use
i just sort of dealt with it
it sounds fine no issues
when i unboxed this guitar i was floored
this is an iconic fuzz pedal
it wasnt supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look
darn near as near to an uncoated string that youre going to find
elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my guitars
these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good
the first is energyxt2 which i believe includes a license for the compact version
im new to electric but my les paul does change tunes
i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up
i am pleased i have purchased this little yet great product
im really happy with my new picks
i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally
i dont own the srh840s but rather the srh440s
the typical clipon tuner has an lcd needle
but then i remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and i thought okay
for the money you cannot even make your own
installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they wont do magic
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
all of my guitars are strung with daddario 10s
built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient
this music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units
we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time
reasonable price great sound  long lasting
my ipad lives on this thing
this piece of plastic is just terrible
great stand for managing multiple guitars
they sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull
you wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick
its not going to unlock on you
apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad i did
it went together fast and is well padded
i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics
it is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece
i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars
all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great
i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment
the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it
all in all a pretty good device
this new strap is plenty long enough and looks good
if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc
nice unit and works perfectly for vocalsguitar bass guitar and keyboards
great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board
quite amazing especially for the price
attack refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck
so much more efficient than a floor monitor
really reliable great sound got no complaints here really
this is one of the quietest mixers ive ever used
not a lot to say about it really
most of them that ive owned you have to plug into your instrument
the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new
the product arrived within 23 days i couldnt believe how fast it got here
i love this microphone stand
so this cant go in several outoftheway places i had hoped would work
great as a booster as others have said
id think its was a cheap knockoff childs guitar
i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine
this tuner is a real good buy at a good price
this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for
now its right where i can find it everytime
it even comes with a matching polyester gigbag
if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you
for the price its good
great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price
wide range to the tone controls
simple but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case
this thing is a tank
nevertheless the sound is quite good
these heads are amazing and a very good investment
it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger
these are durable and long lasting
at the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars
i am going to an a pickguard to this one
i bought them at 45 dollars
there are something special about these strings
31014 edit  looper control is flawed
an allinone guitar tool that is a musthave for any guitar case
i would recommend it to anyone
i really like this strap
it is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings
it is a great pleasure to jam on it around
dark grey letters on a light grey screen
the strap itself is plain but it highlights the beauty of my guitar
give it a test drive and let your ears decide
think i will get another one for the stage monitors
this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didnt
i recommend this to all musicians
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars
like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros
i have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on
but these work fine easy to get strap locks on
i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this
the features and sound are the same
these are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong
now we have the beehold picks
i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele
if you use ext mic
they all work the same
after several days i felt much better about it
once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised
it matches the mic well colorwise and fit
the only way to shut off the power is to unplug it
first of all this is a 40 7guitar stand
will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of nonuse
all in all this is a great pedal
good price and selection here
the factory presets  61120 are not modifiable
just like my taylor only louder
ill probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that its intact this time
some of them have good quality both in make and sound
update 3112 so far so good
he especially likes the colors
overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals
this is from the cleartone cables website about gold connectors don
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect
it is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly
like the black and it holds well
should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz
i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use
it has a fresh lemon scent
im loving this pop filter
i my world thats good stuff
beautiful sound for each of the different modes
i think youll be pleasantly surprised and you sure cant beat the price
must have been built on a friday afternoon or something
they make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well
i am impressed how well this works
anyway these seem to hold up a little better
great for beginners and intermediate players
the suction cup does not work
it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable
it is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar
for fit  i have a large noggin like size 7 58 hat
i just cant get enough sustain out of the high efor my taste
to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings
fender heavies what more needs to be said
so i popped in this kk
the only place is on the box after you have received the item
i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings
i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band
it alows you to fine tune each string
quality is there in construction and signal passing
i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck
its fairy thick and the material doesnt slip around on your shoulder easily
i gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully
now its become a permanent member of the front of my desk
would i get another one
i cant recommend this tuner enough
i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles
the sound quality is amazing and its very easy to use
i replaced a 35 year old fender chorus with this
100 postconsumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load
it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv
this is good quality for the price
ive owned many effects over 32yrs playing
kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip
follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension
it works the same and is pretty durable
i do like these strings
it is accurate reliable for tuning and affordable
still other strings have a rich full resonance that carries through a room
the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video
it hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised i
the high gain channel is really fat sounding
i got what i expected with my purchase you will too
there are tonal differences as expected
i was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so
the competitors that ive tried do not
light weight and very portable
very strong in the set when worn
it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments
i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music
had for over a year hasnt failed
however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible
it also has a dry through output
the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes
im a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars
i guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working
this mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our studios here at
this works fine on a standard guitar
a suggestion from my teacher
if you play cw look no further
i like the 334 wide for my bass
ive used one of these before and dont remember it having lock washers
it gets easier the more you do it
i keep various guitar picks clips pencils etc
but they are kind of a pain
i need to resolder the ends after a concert though
they are clear clean cables
unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black
also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing
its easy to read and dead on
i had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram
sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
price them at a store and you will come back here
i would buy another one if i lost this one
ive seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more
the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage
excellent fine manufacturing good finish
im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
others have commented on the cost of this capo
texture is very nice doesnt slip
if you just want to play around a little this uke will do
i tried some martins ej16s which i love on my seagull s6
it senses the entire scale
if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference
and dont be too rough when winding or it will break
best recomended quality and price
this is a pretty strong cable
this unit works as advertised
for a number of reasons
the package game a little smushed so its a little misshapen
this review is my honest opinion
there are much better ones on the market
a monkey could have written a better driver
i love love love these strings
for the more casual player these might not be the best choice
i have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all
it fits well where i put it
should be able to stand up to any use or abuse
dont know what it is but i love the sound of these strings placebo
however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know
they sound great on my martin too
the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore
a good variety of different picks
this was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and tone
this is the tuner you want
if you need it theres enough wiring to have space between your pedals
that is good and seems to hold up to use
if youre on the fence
perfect for hanging displaying your guitars
used mildly it gives the sound a more natural feel
without debate this will add weight to your guitar
check out the pictures ive posted
love the bright light gauge sound and playability
i already owned two of these tuners previously  purchased these for friends
i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times
only thing keeping it from 5 stars
in conclusion i see no reason not to buy and install these again
this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer
solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise
microphonicnot a big deal it happens all the time
a quality pedal that should hold up well
they are as named very light
historically i have sworn by these though
gets close enough to fake it for a club band
i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass
my bass is not that old but really needed to be cleaned and polished
i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl
might be a little old fashioned but
it is a great lock and works fine but is not for me
hopefully more reliable than sn2
that decision was based mostly on price
nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board
none of that makes me dislike the pedal
this is a distortion pedal
i have a vox ac4tv
it literally gave me chills
its go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel
it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time
and its super easy to apply
it works well with both single and doublecoil pickups
well i need to correct this
it takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new
its nice to have a place for picks on the guitar
the honeytone is aptly named
the learning curve is moderate
ive been using this for a month or so and it works as described
one of the internal amps will no longer power up
basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion
if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap
i used the standard dunlop nylon for years
i prefer the warmer tone
i thought id try something different just to see the differences
so at 8 this is definitely a win
youll need a feedback buster and a good preamp
i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home
these make me a better player
small price for big help
overall reasonably satisfied will give them a good try later
simple idea but a good one
i would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point
havent had a problem until now
some other functional comments about it
drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly
summaryacoustic sounds 34ok34 but noisy in weird ways
this being said its a nice tuner and stays on
now this guitar is a joy to play
dont get me wrong the sans amp is still great
many seem to complain about the plastic housing but im fine with it
works amazing in fl studio
75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off
luv it i had version 1 and this amp isnt much different
definitely holds the guitar well
the strap had a small stain
they cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers
does what it should as expected
my guitar would probably not be happy without it
highly recommended for confort and durability
handel is very comfortable too
but that is a minor complaint
but it can also my blueridge br180 or my seagull s6 coastal spruce
if youre a metal or hard rock player dont buy this
that wasnt really my goal
its built like a rock  has a very fine finish
this is the best pricevalue purchase ive made in a long time
so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest
im glad i bought this
all relevant areas of the capo are well padded
a combination of metal and plastic
wonderful piano feel piano action
i record with fl studio and its even great so far
finally i found a long strap for my new guitar
i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true
i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin
and if you know the g chord you will have lots of fun
flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls
in the mix it was more subtle
he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product
strings might look tacky but theyll stay on there if tied properly
it is not overly strong or stable but the prices was right
it has a nice metal case for storagetravel
i love the little thing
should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it
this produces a much less bright more muted sound
works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears
i did and they love it
great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap
using it as a back up stage mic
fresh strings do sound better
the strap and picks were an added bonus
i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal
it is not road worthy however in our opinion
the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out
my big muff pi with wicker had hellacious noise i mean unusable
they are certainly worth having
the rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo
be warned about it though
in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money
with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside
my son loves this polishcleaner
not a pretty product but good stuff
this is not a subtle pedal
ill also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision
but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds
thats why i say this is the best on the world
delivered in a timely manner
i love the sound but dont want to change strings every week
the sn1 settles quickly and works with a wide array of instruments
my voice sounds great with this thing
almost a perfect pic for me
it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables
sound is like its real big brother
i like the ej 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar
the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of 34regular34 cables
apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception
proof of this lies in the boss unit i have owned for 20 years
looking forward to more tests
it does its job in fantastic fashion but doesnt last the longest
strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils
it works well for its stated purpose and appears to be of high quality
i am totally satisfied with the stand
82 wouldnt have bought a case for most of my condensers
great for picking kind of harsh for strumming  quality seems topnotch
because i wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors
the foam is obviously of good quality and its plenty thick
sweet and warm when the drive is down
this pick holder is pretty awesome
the 10mm tortex picks are blue
the other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear
it does the job but it is a little low on the quality side
great microfiber polishing cloth for a great price
i figured i had nothing to lose
installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes
the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand
these have become my favorites
however my back was still hurting and im definitely a weakling
im using them with both acoustic and electric guitars
these strings are what i use on all  of my acoustic guitars
back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo
it does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice
it uses one cr2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included
now that i have it i take the quality for granted
but after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video i finally broke down
good quality seem durable enough
its cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if youre careful
i also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a celestion g12h30
dont panic strings marked adfb can be used just fine for gcea tuning
great quality for such a low price
you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it
i do not have giant hands so large should fit
i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them
this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice
fits a standard xstand just fine and makes a very secure connection
you can stick it to the guitar
theyre also awesome for live recording use as a monitor
for that its excellent especially considering its very low price
it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package
now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post
so its doing double duty and going strong
whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future
im sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop
on stage has a well built unit here
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
you cant go wrong with daddario strings
if you dont have one get one
others may feel differently i am sure
it does what its supposed to do
now could you use it for a gig
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely
it has no problem with the low e string
if your looking for a studiohome1st amp you cant go wrong with this guy
even plugged into my best preamps in studio
this one produces a great tone and is wellmade
i loved the orange crush but it was totally unreliable
i am trying to learn a few slide riffs
these are also easily removed if they bother you
highly recommended by this writer
although its a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while
not the best not the worse strings but an improvement
its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain
if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must
this is a very good investment
i will buy more in the future
you have a level control a gain control and a tone control
i tried them but didnt like them
came with more screws than i needed
i was shocked by how well it works
this is the pedal to own
easy to get that last bit of fine tuning
its been holding up well
im not on tour with any group
it easily clamps onto my stand and doesnt move around after i place it
it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise
he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there
you can easily connect it to a computer windowsmac with the included usb cable
endless variations in sound avaialable
a straight up product well worth the money
after adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great
i guess i got a bad one
they are well made and do work
books under the head stock
its totally silent very bright display sensitive meter
a steal in my opinion
small piece of adhesive tape on the back
i cant practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv
i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner
beautiful solid tone and no buzzing
one is for my ibanez ak75g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly
consider it overpriced or rather undermade
it also protected my mic in a fall once too
other than the strange color they are good picks
i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great
the thing is that they dont seem to stay
this is a sweet guitar strap
im a firm hosa cable fan
ive used these for years
for the price its worth it i guess
looks cool but thats it
he was not incredibly pleased with it
would reccommend this for voice or instrument use
sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off
these have been my favorite picks for decades now
it also beats the other boss delay pedals available for quality sound and features
tonesound quality  the sound quality of this effect is outstanding
if the amp couldnt do it naturally when it comes to dirty tone
i might have done something wrong
great for linking closequarter effect pedals
this is a very sturdy and wellmade bag
the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful
in fact i highly recommend biyang whenever somebody asks about it
delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed
not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great
my use is relatively narrow  kick drums and amps
im sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though
im impressed with what you get for the price
its fairly tough but flexible
im buying 3 more and it will work only with this
thats plenty high for me even if i were a vocalist and im 61
it does the job as described it though
reasonably comfortable but i dont want it cutting into my neck
keep on hand to help understand theory
otherwise 5 star all the way
it is also very long longer than i thought
the wound strings also seem quite stable
it just slides on the tip of the tripod
it holds where i left it over a year ago
its built like a tank
overall though itll do the job
it has a headphone jack also
like the option of nc or no
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
34why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually
why are these little elliptical end pins so brilliant
its red burst like the legacy fender calls it antique burst
dont get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable
perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar
these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier
this thing folds up so it is easy for storing
also the blue led is very bright
crank this baby up and it moves air
using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp
reputedly the joyo us dream is a copy of the suhr riot distortion pedal
i have purchase 2 to see how they were
very good and very useful device
if it works theres nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it
the amp is on my belt
this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board
that being said i have to admit that these picks are very high quality
took a while to find what i needed but this is what i needed
i have 3 world tour bags to keep my axes safe
anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole
this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay
i even moved it once and it still sticks fine
this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition
works a little better at winding strings than the barebones winders
crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it
plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs
as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list
leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible
and it puts the name 34martin34 on the lowliest box guitar
or where ever you play
at 3 for a dozen theyre worth a try
its just a matter of how much you want to or can spend
any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability
its not bad enough to deduct a star
this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing
i would recommend this strap to all
this one by far evolved from good design
i think a smaller kit would have been better
for 35 or so im not going to complain
hard to beat the price
so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles
very good tunner with bypass switch
its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to dawdat interface
70 db would be better
all good in their own respect
the last thing i want to mention is the xlr preamp
what makes these a bargain is construction
these are not 85x11 paper size
was a clear mike but i didnt detect any body to the sound
oh and did i mention accurate
very happy for the price
much better for the money than i was expecting
i am starting out learning to play guitar
i can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder
i suggest these over the other brands  watch what touring bands use
they tune well and hold a tune well
home recording or just practicing
i also found using a compresser before it helps
i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands
it is made very nice
theyll be easy enough to fixreplace when they fall off so no worries there
i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube
my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try
the system is super easy to use and store on your amp
i added two stars to the product
the only thing i find worse than the intelli is the gooseneck
slow and fast position on the trigger for more control
very nice quality of leather
this just sounds so much fuller and more real
pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2
install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment
they are clearing the shelves preparing for 11 but it has bugs
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
ive used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars
this is the second tuner i have bought like this
fit my 07 mim strat perfectly
it has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility
daddario always puts out a nice product
yes its a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound
these tuners including the red version are the best
one of these recorded perfectly also
worthless and its now holding my sons 34 size classical guitar barely
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks
the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping
i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness
the key to using this pedal is using it correctly
ive even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water
more versatile than the sovereign
this is an amazing amp
this is a nice tuner that works great
i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat
i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus
i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only
to sum it up i love this guitar
i kept the switch because of the quality
both the m1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my texmex pickups
you cant go wrong with aquila
i prefer the more precise and wider scale 1 readout of the snark
im not sure how you would wear it out really
actual description is a blasted 34design34 which is what you get
i think i already mentioned something about it being sturdy
how self adjusting can they be
im amazed at how good this amp sounds
i know i often do
and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in
picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound
perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot
i ended up sending it back for a full refund
this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars
one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet
i just got my snark tuner and im very impressed with it
they are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones
the customer liked them so much he kept them on
i was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar
you can also just clip it to a nearby desk
its a very worthwhile purchase
for this review i used the services of my supermusician friend mike
this is a very well made product
they sound  feel great
this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price
perfect chain for most rock sounds
225 at gc for example
so it will force you to clean up your playing a bit
knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves
the value of this amp is amazing
this thing has tons of gain
these arent too heavy not too light
recieved set of two stands with case promptly and in perfect condition
just make sure to change them often to get the best performance
this is a way to go
i prefer the cactus picks
its truly a one of a kind product
i am very careful how i adjust and have had no problems
when playing the strings behave as normal
buyer beware for this kind of
i really like this cable
the product is good surprisingly loud
hard to beat it as far as leather straps go
i have since gone back to delrin and nylon
this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting
very useful for connecting rack components between
for such a little thing
it lasts long sounds great and feels very nice
other than that works great i like using it
be careful with the load you put on your amp though
guitar slips a little off my knee
who may bump it and knock it over
again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands
but they really dont do all that great a job
this is an absolutely wonderful recorder
these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying
34 anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price
did what it was suppose no need to say anymore
this strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable
this cable filled the bill perfectly
theres a few schools of thought on studio monitors
phosphor bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars imho
i have an electroharmonix pedal thats bigger than this amp
i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price
jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow
according to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab
thanks for good quality products at a fair price
i do not record music with it but i havent tried yet
i have run into the 90 deg
if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed
it holds tune and has not failed yet
wasnt expecting much for this price
this item was received well packed and on time
these straps are very good at a low cost
doesnt make a difference in the sound
this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played
these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything
just try not to get the labels wet
im happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings
so i figured what the heck
this is the right one
sure its a bit of a onetrick pony but its a pretty good trick
i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel
it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors
i used to be able to deal with it
say good bye to batteries
ive got a 12string acoustic guitar
it sounds good natural and spacias
i have no complaints it is my go to mic
i have had no problem with performance
ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid
but forget hooking this directly to a pc
i finally got tired of messing with discs
the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all
hey it does its job for a cheap price
but the pedal itself not for me
i saw these baby on the road with maroon5s james
the first thing i did was went through all the presets
cons  built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped
one final note about behringer
i would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video
a few basses i prefer higher
to be fair i have not tried many other vibes
it helps him remember to practice when he sees it
works good w ableton livedislikes  drum pads
but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character
i was purchasing from my local music store through amazon
i would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar
opened up one recently and the
from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance
check them out they carry ok equipment
distortion is more noticeable at higher volume
i may play around with it to see what all it does
the slightly thicker string is not bad
the lace hot gold value pack with a hot gold hot bridge pickup
i have been playing guitar since i was 14 years old
features i like  lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
this little amp packs tons of tone  sound
over a simple usb headset without 34breaking the bank34
these have always been my favorite strings and ive just about tried them all
they feel and sound great when you play them
it has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone short or tall
great great great great great great great great great
good quality bag for my epi lp
this is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal
just a great overall tuner
all pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar
awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use
imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability
so far that was an ok decision
after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase
like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable
i didnt use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable
for under thirty clams i can look past these things
ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal
every other modes are just nothing special really
the case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets
read the description so you can have a sense of size
my more recent snarks are still running on original batteries
these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well
all these harmonicas in one case and they sound great
in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner
your tone is made up of many many variables
this product is great i use it after every session
as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though
i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery
i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument
the first time i and everybody else saw one i said wow
they might actually be the same stand under different names
hello musicfriends  this is built cheap but sounds great
after using the better pickup the amp doesnt have any issue yet
very good stand especially for the price
one nitpicky point of criticism  the packaging is an issue for me
i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price
im going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good
i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box
that said  the ds1 does exactly what i wanted it to
i love the elixir strings
so i picked these up
footswitch jack is on the front
honestly they dont need to be at least for most guitars
after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube
in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists
i love the dual bulb design
i use is this mount to support a samson meteor mic
thats how much he payed
now that ive learned how best to use it ill keep it
perfect perfect size weight shape
so just make sure you get the right one
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck
it is very responsive to pressure
good height comfortable id buy it again no questions asked
the snark sn8 is far superior
i like the black look to my guitar now
subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing
spend the extra 2 its well worth it
its a great tuner a little pricy but worth it in the long run
i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way
customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this
this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized
the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide
even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar
its easy to take on and off
this one i like for my vocals live
however i have loaded the software on my laptop
these cables are very good
it doesnt sound exactly like an sm57 but it will get you close
the old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and 34alive34
i added a clip on led light as well
great for acoustic and electric
the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now
high quality and great sound
therefore after playing i always wipe down my strings to extend their life
it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play
the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer
ill likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts
good cable as good as any expensive brand
so i have to do it in the loop i guess
its soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat
ill definitely only buy these from now on
sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value
it really makes the guitar stand out
i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing
as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more
that said i have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well
all speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot
while it is just a stand it seems to be sturdy and durable
and it has worked flawlessly
but i do feel confident in what i report here
the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup
i think it ends here
simply these are great cables
this item does not travel well and is best used at home gently
this is a great stand
i hope it never breaks
go sell your snake oil to someone else
i keep one in each guitar case
we will see how long they last
however that tuner had at least two limitations
ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change
more mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack and less lows
the bag is well padded and i cant believe the price
very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals
brass tacks  is this the greatest mic in the world
its light weight and sturdy
all the metal parts look sturdy and durable
they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect
the first five have three different levels of style each
i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey
holy guacamole you guys this amp
another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats
sounds all right to me bright and well balanced sound
this is simply the best power supply out there
i prefer an extra heavy pick because theres no delay from pick deflection
these strings sound full and warm on the instrument
everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing packageing and shipping
the connection strap is a great enhancement for my d18 and fits wonderfully
update   i just saw that this capo is eligible for amazon prime
wide sweeping flange effect great harmonics and little power useage
this little tuner is excellent
having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal
the delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound
i use these on my fender strat and they sound great
really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot
a little to thick for my style though
you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters
theyre as good for speedpicking as they are for strumming
i bought one of these a couple of years ago
i have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so its probably fairly wellshielded
would definitely purchase it again
many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo
at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case
its a great musicians party favor
i just received these tuning machines today
use them all the time
first wax i have bought
they last forever and dont break
this was a great purchase
tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar
the cloth is just what i wanted
this guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish
seems like it is part of the design
they are all battery hogs
to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads
not sure what else you could want out of it
i got it in red
i love my levys jacquard straps
ive had this for 4 days and im so glad i bought it
i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
easy on the fingers too
if youve read some of my other reviews you know im a serial hotrodder
now stop reading this review and buy this capo
they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised
cant beat the price either
of course the durability is still in question at this point
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand
the model number is 333001 probably also discontinued
seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width
well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed
the mic has a headphone jack
the behringer for example was hardwired to its cable
it is perfect in controlled stationary environments like home studios
and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has
i really like the cherub pickup
my son practically ran to the ups man when the truck pulled up
the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy
youll find it in this pedal
but for my purposes that is a plus
a lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar
im a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only
so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat
but these are just wish list items
the only one ive found that doesnt is the kyser
there you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them
this is a great deal for two microphone stands
i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks
of course if youre running a chain of drivedistortion pedals youre asking for it
makes changing strings a whole lot easier
even with that little extra expense youll come out ahead
operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass
for those of us who find acoustic guitars difficult to play this is solution
a guitar player for 20 years now i decided to give it a try
these are my favorite brand of strings
its amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electroacoustic guitar
once you8217ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play
this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised
when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill
fourth plays nice with computers
now lets talk about how the pedal sounds
this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar
i store my picks in there and i put it by my table
its soft without being limp
ill also note that its even affordable while its brand new
some may disagree but im convinced
this is a pretty good nonexpensive capo
this unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay
it seems to work best with power chords root5th note and single notes
the sound is very natural and true to my voice
for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use
34youre not getting the right tone man
i tried it in the key of g and got useful results
so whats then point of all this
it does make the strap long but is suppose to
hows that for an endorsement
you shouldnt have any problems
the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only 20
nothing but the best going on this guitar including this plate
something you might want to think about before getting one of these
easy to grip and are pretty quite
fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway
its built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand
cheap easy durable these things are worth the small price
i tried it for ipad
my bass is an sx jazz bass
standard built like a tank boss construction is renowned for
longevity yet to be seen
great overdrivedistortion for classic rock music
so why only 4 stars
i am glad i got the ds1 but for other reasons
the price was right im happy with it
other than that when you need 1032 rack screws these are the real mccoy
stores 99 loops doubt id ever in my lifetime need that many
i would definitely recommend it to a friend
they are your regular picks
mine has a white case
helps keep those ugly microphonics away and you want that big time
placed it on top of my 18 crash and it looks great
works great if used correctly
bone does make a considerable difference i have found
very stable clamp mechanism works very well
they are great for jamming with friends  are so user friendly  accurate
over kill or uber cool you decide
it is a standard length just like the sm58
for something but not a guitar
so i bought this shoulder pad
i have 2 of these actually
the j53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks
i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips
i use these at work now
i am not good at putting things together without help
it is well worth the 60 i paid for it
this one is the most basic
the cables are very long maybe too long if thats possible
the accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings
the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price
it just worked like the old one
without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case
the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings
i hated having to put the pick between strings
it mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need
i am using it for both some music and computer stuff
my son needed a capo expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons
i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar
i do not need anything fancybecause i am a simle person
i bought this case for my rogue astyle electric mandolin
seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box
i bought this using prime and am happy with the power supply
this saves so much time for getting strap on and off
this polytune 2 is amazing  bright accurate strobe option well built
i cant raise the volume above 1 in my house
i was very suprised that it was this effective
ive done it  it sucked
the box is a solid cast metal box with a very heavy metal base
this has saved my bass drum head from many holes
great for carrying with you
this was an excellent purchase
when you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost
i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash
i thought they were crazy
but other wise this thing gets a serious twostar 34meh34
the unit itself seems sturdy and well made
its always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place
im pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sps
strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job
amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive
just try and leave it on always
especially on the low end
i got this to install it on a podium
but this is my favorite muff thus far
i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item
i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand
the quality of the screen is very good
also picks up noise from your movements
i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them
they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and im not noticing any extra noise
also its a vintage style not a mid 80s mosquito tone killing device
i decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings
this bottle will last a lifetime
at first i used the elixir polywebs but those things broke all the time
the product is well built easy  to use pretty straightforward
id definitely recommend this product to a friend
the 299 models are great right out of the box usually
they work in a variety of applications metal hard rock jazz blues reggae etc
thats it for set up
and then there is the the metalonmetal clankyness
i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing
i use the chair for guitar bass keyboardsukulele and even cooking breakfast
gotta keep it simple on this review because its a simple item
not the smoothest operation in the world but its gigbag small and accurate
the 5w setting can really crank out the volume
ive used this live since i got it and it works great no problems
it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well
well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning
the national mediums i was using before had a looser fit boggle
the plate was delivered on time and as promised by amazon
about the same tension as 9s on a strat
i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews
what im getting at is you get what you pay for
i just wish more came in the pack
added mass easier to tune
really nice product for the price
i play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great
do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one
really easy to use and well built
the input and output connectors are excellent
popped one of these into my hartke lh500 bass head it it sounds great
my gear used for testing  fender american deluxe stratocaster
i use it with a fender frontman amp
i managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck
high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound
think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier
the snark sn1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate
grab a set you wont be disappointed
this is a great pedal
i only wish it came with two of them
i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit
exactly what i needed for testing guitars and playing at home
this daddario micro ns tuner tops all those with ease
the box already fell down 4 times i got small kids
i currently have a looper overdrive distortion echo and tuner on my unit
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar
depends on what your looking for
i was a bit disappointed in this gadget
reviews described strap as 34soft34 and 34weathered34 which sounded good to me
deep storage pocket and more
im telling you get it
con  the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully
a little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it
our teenager really likes these
in my opinion this thing is well worth the price
are they made with exotic materials
these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well
so at least between these two i found no total differences
fits my tenor uke and violin just fine
perhaps a straight to straight would be better
mixed bag and at 200 shouldnt be
i used this on noisy hinges car doors etc
09s to try on my strat and the
its boss so it will last forever
that would be a mistake
but it was a bit of a pain
its supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasnt tilted back or fallen over
they are basic standard traditional strings
if youre into that sort of thing
a very 34different34 sound range than round wounds
the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day
notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc
fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff
as i get better i will upgrade
what does anyone really want to know about a string winder
i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall
whatever size you are looking for dunlop is the best option
and this thing is loud
these are a musthave item
i buy these for my son
finally i just went with this one and im pretty happy with it
there are several types of practice amps
with flatter eqs it is fairly noiseless
my guitars sustain was definitely improved with this nut
do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal
sustain is very good as a result
the padding is better that i expected
the run around at the post office of getting it resent was ridiculous
divas will not use the red ball windscreen
like it can do all this crazy cool stuff
i love the red burst design of this guitar it looks absolutely wicked
this is a solid 4 depth and cozy padding around it for protection
a quality bag for a quality instrument
i dont know what kind of strings are on it out of the box
these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable
comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble
this item is very convienent
but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldnt recommend this item
didnt want to spend 150 for a reverb so gave this a try
at least the previous 2 i bought did
the sn13 is another great snark chromatic tuner with a super tight display
i use mine for practice at home and for lowvolume band rehearsals
not a problem for me but it may be for some
cause thats what this bad boy or girl to be pc does
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board
most of all they are cheap
i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this
most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others
attaching it is a snap
hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines
i have a 57 reissue strat and i cant tell the difference
altogether im very satisfied with this tuner
a little disappointed with the cable
the classic fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth
the price is great too
these strings sound super awesome
of course its not great
but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin
mine lasted for a couple of weeks
now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore
try to practice for about an hour daily
anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad
i would not recommend this pedal
i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include
too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle
it tends to fall off quickly on low notes
but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright
this is an excellentsounding pickup
the unit itself is great
plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking
the guitalele measures 2712 x 9 x 234 at their widest points
other than that they look cool in the package
i play and practice a lot and i abuse strings
the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain
they lasted 3 years and i play nearly every day for hours
stable and precise pick attack
this pick however takes it to the next level
i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine
id even say it was cute
easy to adjust to very light on my fingers and theyre built to last
its subtle but its beautiful
im a seasoned player of almost 10 years
this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them
so youll need to decide what songs they work for etc
this thing controls your tone so well
this leaves the level controlsa place where mxl could have been more careful
although it doesnt have a tone dial it doesnt need one
beginnerintermediate level player would be very pleased
this pedal works great and doesnt slide at all
even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing
i installed them last night and could not be happier
i now rate it at 5 stars
get 2 amps and split the signal even
if youre always dropping picks losing picks breaking picks this is perfect to have
no damage at all to any of them
i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy
the fact that it is wide is nice
no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going
but overall the amp looks very well constructed
not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well
for the price and quality i would buy two other ones
pretty doesnt count for much with me
what you put into the input comes out the same only louder
i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs
its not a highend 200 pro stand
great price but very fragile
any guitarist knows how one of these works
they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures
it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune
for metal artists i would recommend looking elsewhere
you dont have to worry about mixing up your strings
the mic end of the mount works pretty good
this is the second clip on tuner i have bought
i have several of these straps in different colors and ive never been disappointed
this one seems to consume coincell batteries at an unacceptable rate
i purchased this for my 10 year old daughter
this was a great purchase
but i had wire snips from my jewelry kit available
rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard
as far as i can tell they are all the same widththickness
why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe
that low cost is obvious
fits nice and provides good protection
i like the build and design
it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case
i like that this is fairly light
what more could you ask for in a strap
the capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well
i bought three more after trying the first one
i would recommend it for light to moderate use
im on my second us600 pedal after the first one broke
its a good finish but not the place to start
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries
i got one of those for my next mandolin after my johnson
but it definitely gives you the effect
are my behringer eurolive active pa speakers as good as my mackie srm450 speakers
it plays well and the sound
this was a cheap capo but it does its job well
i adore the sound of this unit
its quite hard on your collarbone
still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price
throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials
it was easy to install
the sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less
a good tool for study and applying to your music
if you can make the software work consistently
glad i went with the jjs and not looking back
i wish i had 4 ears so i could buy another one
durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum
and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce
let me start by saying im always on the quest for great amazing tone
never thought itd be my goto pedal
bottom line  as a monitor look no further
this pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out
even then you wont get a great clean tone
lastly the old standard dyna comp
its a good product just what i expected
and its a great price buy them
overall i like this winder
btw  12axt and ecc83 are the same tube
i like the recording software cubase that came with it
people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo
then again i never did really like tss
i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either
this amp is small in size but full of sound
i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior
i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china
the finish looks very good
keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks
but didnt have the cash for another at4033 or similar
i would definitely buy them again
i got three single channels and two dual channel units
this microphone only has a usb port
a lot of which do not sound to digital
this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while
this just was my choice this time
it tunes better than any tuner ive ever used
they set the baseline for every guitar ive ever owned
probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit
this is my second after breaking the last ones neck
if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know
i recommend this to anyone with an astyle mandolin
ive heard some complaintsworries about the flimsiness of the plastic
black tortex picks with silver lettering
seen these and they work great when needed
i have several clipon tuners that clip directly to the headstock
this is a heavy solid high quality mic
makes even first tuneup easy
will last forever sound great
the leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps
the pick extends out from the rubber shell
i much prefer it without the winder
i wasnt expecting it to be this nice
ive been using mxr micro chorus for over 30 years
unlike the clamp kind like the snark its hard to share
its a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars
but i really wanted 34natural wood34 and it isnt
the beat boy is everything that this unit is and then some
if its past center the string is sharp
then he grabbed his g7 from the car and let me try it
also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it
i just turn the mic off
seems well made for the price and works as advertised
i like them and my playing buddy likes them
i have a similar one but it has blue fire on it
appears to be well made
they are black plastic ones
great strings at a great price
flawless comes to mind here
its all just so much marketing garbage
this delay is really nice especially for the price
stamina mode is supposed to run for 11 hours
it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring
these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well
they sound great and play great and i usually purchase daddario or martin strings
this kyser will last a long long time
man this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks
it works very well and is very sturdy
they call these mini tuners but to me they are just right
it is not bad but i dont think i would purchase another one
i couldnt figure out the different tunings on it though
the build quality is top notch
there are also with two dimples
sound quality  the bx5 sounds neutral and balanced
as a matter of fact i ordered 2 more
no but it doesnt cost as much either
didnt harm the finish at all
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
i remember these from 35 years ago in high school band
so ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now
been playing for five decades now
i wouldnt trust this strap without a strap lock
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac33 acoustic amp
its an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type
these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice
if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it
i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus
the base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it
the build seems very good
its an important component in my studio
i hope this helpsjps  the currency is in us dollars
i bought this to use with my keyboard
this replacement so far is hanging in there
these seem fine to me
i got these for my electric and the ej2610p acoustic electric for my acoustic
do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil
they have a long life and do brighten your tone
the yamaha keyboards that take batteries dont come with an ac power adapter
been working without a problem to this day
exactly as advertised no complaints from this user
overall i recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp
cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components
for the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose
both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp
this is an amazing bargain
the tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones i can find
of course its not too loud  thats the whole point
the screen pops out easily but it will pop back in
this little wonder though is fantastic
lets face it in general string winders are pretty much all the same right
its easy to use and see
its way better built than other pedals in this price range
many musicians use two delay pedals
i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage
i own 18 guitars 16 of which are electrics
they are excellent quality for the money
you retune your guitar to an open tuning
if you have a lower end guitar this will make a huge difference
i wouldnt venture to use it on the road all the time
no need for a collection of separate tools anymore
i have a heavy touch when i play the guitar
he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings
great pick i recommend it
this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners
maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean
i had a friend with one of these and he loves it
i put these on and what a difference
surprisingly loud really its amazing that much sound comes out of that thing
very happy with this low cost strap
longer scales like a strat
it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board
lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy
fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off
we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered 2 more
it gets the job done and seems durable for my needs
its amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha
plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see
both ends are a loop
its red when out of tune and green when in tune
we both seem pretty happy with it
man what a great sound
very happy going to order more
i normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar
you can connect an ipod or laptop to it
if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased
good buy for the money
that proved to be true to form
the korg ca1 also cost slight less
great all round pick one of my favorites
not when that string is toast in 50 minutes zero doubt there
bottom line  every guitarist should have one
these microphones are great for recording vocals
holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless
the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly
well here are is the long term 100 secure solution
the price is not too bad
the guitar stays in tune while playing
dont know why i waited so long
the low price tag didnt hurt my feelings either
you cant beat the price
the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them
the last two of these that i have owned met untimely deaths
im a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords
i use this when i broadcast from streetjellycom
the sound of the current mini is classic fender singlecoil
d one love fender mustang you rock
the pedal has knobs for output volume and sensitivity basically amount of compression
to me these always feel perfect
the difference between hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable
i would like to let people know they are very stiff
this capo is one of the best made ive seen
also there arent really any quality digital options that are significantly cheaper
i know cause i playem geetar real goodlike
2  it wont clean up when you turn your guitar down
60mm pitch black guitar picks best
microphone preamp is soso i guess
i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out
i think it will work great for that
easy affordable fast why go out
soi f you want to turn distor t offu cannot
if youre boss you need the info
even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar
reasonable price makes it even better
idk why gc does not carry these
it has a retro look and an old school sound perfect
and im planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program
great strap durable and good lookin
i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal
yes you can bend it
i have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio
easily the best quality capo for its price
great for a quick look in between songs
i buy tons of them all the time
the fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection
however the price was great and the sound is good
i dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like
cant miss dealing like that
i cant believe im writing this but its ture
turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock
i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion
i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii
it responds to picking very well and organically
its not bad or anything just different
highly recommended also fits on my guitar stand very cool
nice part is it works on all stringed instrument
dont leave home without it
it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine
and most are planet waves already
these are a great deal
very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician
cant go wrong for the price
i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity
i just wish i had a better feeling about the premature breakage
polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric
i have two of these and i use them
the goods are up to scratch and fit properly
fair priced and i love the color of the green ones
nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop
fender accessories 0733150406 pure nickel electric guitar strings custom are very good
if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo
does all the job that i need it to perform
i also have the software version of this effect on my daw
a nobrainer as far as i can tell
other than that great picks
i absolutely love using these strings 1046 on my telecaster and stratocaster
its not great but should work as a quiet practice amp
got this tuner for my new bass
this combo string winder peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately
this shoulder rest is very comfortable and really helps get the right playing angle
this is a 5 star stand considering the price
i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming
these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive
when i first installed these strings i wasnt too impressed
im an amateur sound tech
otherwise a wonderful product at a great price
this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action
it is solid yet flexible in height and angle
ill report back if it doesnt happen again for a while
end up losing them verses breaking
but it is still an error in functionality
the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome
puts out pretty good power for a little 5w
it works with all of them
i bought this to use on my fender pbass
each of the legs has 3 holes low middle high
didnt need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much
but chances are both will sound good
otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound
second its 15 watts and is pretty darn loud
i doubt i will lose them
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard
what can you say about a tool
pick wearing is virtually nonexistent and i utilize altpicking a lot in my practices
it has lasted for over a year and the battery hasnt died yet
if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one
still its a very good tuner overall
and i like those strings better
so i sent it back to amazon for a refund
if you love delay and want variety this is your pedal
these are really great guitar locks
pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments
very low noise repairable effective strain releafthick rubber cover
makes the whole house safer for the martins
so its a give and take issue
this is a pack of guitar strings
the vox model is also really jangly sounding  like its supposed to
in fact i have already bought them several times
i keep a stack of
im not a professional but have been playing for many many years
cant go wrong with this one
daddario guitar strings are favourite strings
will get aother one for 2nd guitar
this is an extremely versatile pedal
i have small hands and had no problem playing it
only complaint is the stacking of the six effects onto just two knobs
just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need
and for the price id buy it again
i bought this for my son to clean his guitar with
most gig bags dont come with all these storage pockets
it has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great
the only problem in my household is
hard to find just 10 mike cords
we are a tough act to follow
run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer
for 300 you can get a vox w an overdrive delay and reverb
these heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound
so its get better as you use it
the screws strip out too easily
it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up
i bought this for my son so he could record with it
you know it is a pretty decent stompbox
does not fair well when stored in non cooled area
but it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones
60 picks perfectly by the way
works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over
a must have for guitar teachers imho
i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did
i have been a gigging musician for over 20 years
did not end up using them but will one day
the monster chord is great looking but for me they are too stiff
a note about the mixed reviews
what a difference with the epiphone
some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway
these picks work well and look as pictured
fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything youll need
it isnt the softest strap
surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable
he absolutely swears by them
not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce
i play a tele and an acoustic martin
i expected this shure sm57 knockoff to disappoint me
excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right
its built for the long haul
but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume
you do use them right
id definitely buy it again
i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio
uses a 9v battery or power supply
it has a bit different sound obtained when i use this one
better deal if you dont just buy one and have to pay single shipping
these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion
unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell
i would have much preferred a device that has a twoposition switch
perfectly happy with this strap
i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future
the welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job
otherwise sound quality is excellent
it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock
i had a lot of questions and concerns when i ordered this
new strings and scratch free
i honestly didnt notice anything different
they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily
all guitar stores display their guitars with them
well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent
it sounds cleaner and brighter
i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock
the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case
you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish
these strings speak with a bolddefined and powerful voice
however if you mostly play rhythm id stick with the stock speaker
this isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what youre getting
one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on
really is a great buy
you get either room or hall
i tried other strings but i always come back to elixir
details the basic concept is good
they had good reviews and the price was right
not to mention how great they look
it seems like yes they are
continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry
ive played through the amp for a couple weeks now and its great
this pedal is not new to me
they are flexible but not flimsy
overall a good deal for the price
the sound and tone are great and the price is right
very happy with this purchase
these are my favorite strings
for the multi guitar owners i think this is great
the a string too doesnt project as much as the standard strings
i bought this for my new 12 string guild acoustic
a bit annoying but not the slides fault i guess
i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them
for such a small combo this amp really packs a punch
i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results
ive seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz
i have been using these strings for 7 years
i am going to be waxing now on
i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies
however i have yet to try it with my multitrack studio
just not a fan of the cheap shiny plastic versions
but do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon
behringers mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price
i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better
it leaves very little rosin dust on the violin
both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses
make the sound clean and bright
used this to dress up the saga tele kit i bought on amazon
my curiosity didnt end there though
the tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable
it has just become a needless expense
no buzzing on the strings when i put it on
thank goodness amazon doesnt sell this gadget for the fortydollar retail price tag
very inexpensive yet reliable cord
works great for blues rock a little stoner country and even some metal
this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well
i lost one and had to buy another one
works great and base is out of your way
no residue no sticky and no oil film
for those unfamiliar with voxs amplug products these things are amazing
whichever set one ultimately chooses cant go wrong with the qualityprice ratio
this is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier
thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try
makes it easy to clean too
this is a solid little usb interface
since i have better equipment now i havent used it as much
some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording
if you buy the keyboard youre going to need the power adaptor
i have 7 of these bad boy tuners and i love them
they work great theyre quiet and theyre cheap
but i cant help it  i like this guitar
ive purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable
guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot
i will not buy any other cable except planet waves
has a nice smell works like a charm
i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and its the same
stays where it is supposed to
but it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects
i suspect most folks are in the same position
bought this distortion pedal for our son
mounts well but try to find a stud certainly
works really nicely at limiting background noise
i bought these for my little sister and she loves them
no need to over tighten the adjusters
i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar
i have no desire to buy any other brand
i would buy it again
the fit  finish speaks quality
but its much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that
i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected
i did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference
yet its durable enough even for the roughest of players
it more than lived up to my expectations
finally and this is important theyre incredibly comfortable
if it is the pickup will mute the a string and its annoying
great foot switch that is easy to use
i agree with the others reviews
this tuner works by guitar vibration
the sm sounded muted compared to d5 without any sound modification out of box
i paid about 75 for mine and have zero regrets
fender truly went to 11 on this one
in comparison the shure clips are 14 in
however for other people the sm58 works better
the tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound
but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected
when laying empty it is 50 long x about 12 wide and lays flat
cant go wrong for the price imo
i absolutely love these picks and swear by them
this is a great program for nondrumming one man bands like me
anyone that wants a nice versatile pedal this is the one you want
not sure what other than complete failure would take stars away
its fun and easy to record my own songs
i may buy a second one as a backup
the local shop only charged me 5 to shave them down
i can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar
i have a nanoweb before and so far the exp16 is better
is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy
you should buy those too theyre great
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs
does it do exactly what you want a simple slapback echoreverb to do
but i prefer the walker williams brand
they snap and go airborn which is dangerous
look at what it does and what it costs
it comes with a mic stand holder thing
nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings
todays sm7b is the best noncondenser vocal microphone still in production
setup is finished and i can now agree with most reviewers
i use this cable for small home recording projects
you want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal
i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights
my taylor is much louder now that i use these
this is a very heavy guage
solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge
enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees
its an 8 channel xlr snake
give these a try if youre looking for some new strings
works well withdunlop dual design straplok system blacktoo
my guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug
young smaller player or a
the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps
these strings are worth it
the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl
the vibration mode is really good
they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification
they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it
it is perfect for what it is
some will disagree saying they break if theyre too thin
i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem
it folds up very nicely
2 i use the black white and blue colors
here are a few of the features that i really like about it
i have had zero issues with these
much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before
but it sounds great to me
this inexpensive delay is very special
less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp
they do the job and are made well
but you need to rehearse
now there are two choices for excellent coated strings
its thin but does the job well
and it is the best bet for the money
these strings are well packaged and easy to unroll and string on my guitar
the pick pocket is cool though i wont be using it
they are easy to use
im using these with the behringer 1202fx mixer
ive used a variety of tuners
this is the 2nd tuner like this that i have purchased
ive been using this product for months now and have no complaints
i use tortex guitar pick of that thickness
i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine
they already have your money
only thing i miss a bit is a headphone jack
very solid clasps one of which locks
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it
but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before
bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo 6
am very happy with what i got for the price i paid
i give them an excellent rating
i like the quality of the picks
the strap wouldnt hold my guitar any longer
i like it as the stars say
joyo continues to surprise me
the 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff
the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls
i needed a jack plate for my custom stratocaster build and ordered this one
its quick and pretty on the money
it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff
dirt box gold for under 50 bucks
this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size
i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal
daddario strings are like the kias of the string world
black or red the color is the only difference
ive had to change a few batteries but they last a long time
nice solid construction and vibration mount included
the strings have a nice feel to them
i am happy with this product
noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price
it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars
bought this for a friend
has a rich warm tone like tube mics
tuning with it can be condensed into one word  frustrating
these look great on my guitar
i figured it would go the same way as the threeway  wrong
actually much better than i expected for the price
this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping
even the packaging it cool
i would not recommend it
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender
you gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up
its made in china but isnt most everything these days
its a stand it does what its supposed too
its a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use
it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes
i paired this up with the ma400 and it works great
fist off guitar center had this for 29 bucks
it gets the job done
classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black 76 tele custom
this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves
i currently have 8 pedals setup on this board
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
this is a great little addition to both my violin and my mandolin
to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked
unfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device
just waiting for a good deal
they are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet
leaves no ffingerprints or smudges
then later used a boss tu12 for years
slips down becuase of wieght
the rogue ra090 comes in a variety of color choices
for such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service
roland fender line6 and others still have that niche dialed in
the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand
i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain
worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make
hey if it makes our son happy so be it
excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii
ill look silly if it lets me stay in tune
very good for the price
it sounded ok and i like the features on it
this pedal received the gain and jcm mod
i think that you will love it if thats what youre looking for
the best strings i ever bought and ive bought them all
i bought this during the black friday sale
i am very happy with my purchase
i still cant get over the fact that it is a 40w amp
get it if you need one
this came at no surprise
theyre also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s
ive used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar
i own several and have had no trouble with them
try them out and make your own decision
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar
on my resonator these provide a full loud sound
construction  solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff
it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing
this mixer has great audio
just remember the key words  slow and gentle
it hardly generates any dust and gives the bow that extra grab
we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner
makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally
what a buy for the price
also great for those starting out learning an instrument
purple ones with the turtle500 on them
what can i say these are great patch cables
i like to use different gage picks therefore
i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isnt one of them
these strings are the best
but it doesnt just read the letter of the note your on
update  10132012 update of my 2010 review
its definitely flat and natural sounding which i like
this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster
product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller
it is exactly as represented
i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard
its a value at full price also
this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop
all in all its a pretty nice device expecially for the price
got them today and put them on a wasburn x series
using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic
very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth
these things muffle sound great
epiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar ebonyhello again
i have used fender medium picks since the late 60s
theyre not bad but dont expect them to last like elixirs do
i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies
but i was happily surprised
i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke
when i bought this i though it wouldnt be enough
theres simply no place to clip it
it is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs
a fine product that i expect to last for years
its safe all latches match up well
after putting in new pegs and restringing with these strings
i still need to read a lot of the users manual
im pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model
its a nice thick cable
i would not purchase this product again
after using it a couple of times i can only give it high marks
great quality string winder and cutter
i will get another for my monitor
they work like a charm
but not that big a deal
sometime i use a phaser or a tremolo
i have the kt7800 which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust
but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style
dont buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca
they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend
all i can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing
so it wont sound the same on every guitar
maybe buy and inspect with the knowledge you might have to return them
the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in
cutter winder and pin puller
i lke these strings very much
dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years
perfect fit  they look great
all in all if you need a budget system at home  get this
the answer to that question is surprisingly good
played well right out of the box
on my electric guitars i dont like the look at all
by far the biggest change was the 34pointyness34 of the picks
for the money i dont think it can be beat
play some old kiss or some rob zombie
as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning
so i got these and they are awesome
next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected
you can now plug it into the wall
the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other
easy to get on and off
not much you can say
its a fender heavy so theres not much else to say about that
and of course the guitar sounds good
i break high e strings on occasion
ive been making great recordings since
a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up
so maybe it is a good thing
i think the ac15c1 is actually a better blues amp
nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all
the medium was the hardest out of the bunch
this was a great buying experience
i have purchased several snarks of all different types
hopefully the at value cable will hold up
has padding where it needs it to protect guitar
snare kick and so on
couldnt be happier with my purchase
daddario make the best strings out there
perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart
very happy for this product
much less surface of the string touching
the tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar
andy said that this product is far superior to any other
in fact i found it increases speed
the display is bright and the interface is very intuitive
applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets wipes right up
easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones
not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out
when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry
the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used
if using usb does not need external power supply
affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay
i will probably stick with daddario since i dont find any difference in them
what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand
i would recommend it to anyone
my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip
i bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp i play guitar
nothing out of the ordinary
if you never used it get a can you wont regret it
i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards
it respects my arms desire for freedom of movement
and they produce no audible hum into the circuit
i only installed into studs and wouldnt really want to try a drywallonly installation
the daddario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price
i use them as room mics mainly for which they perform admirably
im not going to gush over this one
i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day
they are lighter than i expected
no telling how long the switches will last
i bought two microphones a akg d5 and sm58
probably insist on  34dont mention anybody but us
theyre especially wonderful because theyre battery operated
it is no lightweight either
the tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes
i imagine it would work great for lead players but im a rhythm player
tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available
now my recordings are much more crisp
pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards
switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato
the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual
i believe these are nicer than the epis
this was a huge disappointment
i have never played a string instrument
i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs
they sound clean and crisp
just dont use this for guitars
but of course then its too loud
housed in a plastic casing
good length but very slippery
easy to understand with responsive controls
cheap and convenient iam not disappointed
im 62 and weigh 225
the overdub layering is simply superb though its saved as mono
but dont get me wrong its still pretty strong
the attack heads that i bought though are single ply
one reviewer says its made by fender
classic tubescreamer tone at 14 the price
doubt ill use the strap
added a couple drops and it worked like a charm
lots of folks like them but not for me
the latest one has a very mellow amber color led
i never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag
sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can
i thought it worked good and mine was a bit dry
this capo isnt quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar
pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did
the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some
just one thing  that strap is too big for kids
or adult bottled beverage while playing
but ive confirmed i like heavier gauges
this is the best one out there bar none
pretty simple it does what its supposed to do
how about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall
got this because i thought the length would be enough
ive had them for 23 months now and they havent failed me yet
i also found that im getting better response with my guitar tone knob too
you need monitors or quality headphones
my hartke 410vx cabinet was designed by an idiot
i did not want to spend a lot to start
the mistake i made was buying them hastily
i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass
for most singers it will be just what they need
behringer us600 ultra harmonistshifter pedal is pretty good
outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with hossen
the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive
colors are abit too flashy
i havent had much chance to play it but so far so good
saves some money on replacements
seems like i found a winner
take some time but it was well worth it
i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential
even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable
that was a nice benefit
i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks
i would recommend this to anyone
they have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see
as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built
i use them with azoom g1n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great
martin makes great sounding strings
its light dont know if it would handle major abuse but wow
this will definitely last a long time
at that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy
this mighty bright is  great
the basic stuff on the bullet is very good
they last pretty long for noncoated strings and play nicely too
i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward
it is well made and stays on without falling off
another issue with the ca40 is the poor screen
the pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust
not much to say about foam
the pedal is very good at this
this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps
once its fit to you though it works beautifully
one this is a long island company located in farmingdale new york
some may like the martins but few wont love the aquilas
its easy to install and i guess its cheap
nice bends and of course the longer playing life
not sure if thats from rough handling
i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds
ill keep it as a spare just in case anyway
get a mxr custom badass 78 distortion
with a bit of tweaking is fine for studio work
i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out
no corner protectors on this
these assorted picks are really all the same just different colors
but i stand in front of a mic on stage
i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends
people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm58
these do that much better than schallers and the fender ripoffs of schaller
this is a nice little pedal
they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings
overall looks a nice piece especially for the cost
a very nice addition to my collection
the contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality
just forget about trying to use the display
not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes
this is true for either one of the models
much easier and faster to change strings
my friend hated that part too and i agree with her
nothing special but the price isnt out of the world either
there is another device called a uke leash that also works well
the price is really good
base is heavy and sturdy so your mics wont topple over
at first glance the different tone kits dont bring much to the table
ill probably be returning this unit asap
when fully extended the arm cant hold the entire weight of the shockmountyeti microphone
wuhan makes great products for the money
works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish
the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged
i have a candy apple red squier surf statocaster
i would have no issue gigging with this unit
seems like a nice pedal
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier
so i sent it back
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
a wise choice for the budget conscious
the idea is good and its cute
i bought mine from austin bazaar
it comes with one free disintegrating pick
its for my wife who is learning guitar
so whats not to like
it does what it should
this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level
it is very lightweight which is also a plus
i had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing
the sound is kind of acoustic guitarukulele banjo ish
ive owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk
this one is definitely the best
you cant rely on the product description or packaging to answer that
there really is no midi support
i like the old version more
if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it
if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it
i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player
i am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard
i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings
the back rest support is nice too
pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate
it was a great choice
maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference i dont know
amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience
i use these on all my guitars
i bought these as spares and they look really cool too
not complaints just works and is reasonably priced
it works well i mean it doesnt crumble apart or anything
its metal and it works
lately i have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings
its a nice little tuner and my guitar is sounding great
id buy it again but they should really include a washer
ill be sticking with these for the long run
with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place
i like that this one shuts off automatically
i bought one about 4 months ago and just ordered a second
tried the same lick with the ragin cajun and it sounds perfect
that may seem like a small issue
it can hold quite a bit of weight
the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package
when i put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly
removes those annoying popping ps out of your recordings
the tone is great they8217re durable and smooth on the fingers
cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff
it works great to hang a standard size guitar on
feels great sounds great theres a little bit of magic in these strings
in the past its always been a crapshoot regardless of brand or reputation
however for the home player this tuner will work just fine
i own the holier grail
this works great with the mustang i amp
this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide
i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos
and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit
its important for my playing to not have finger noise
all set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe
i didnt like the ac adaptor
all my guitars have these locks on them and im very satisfied
the bag is well padded and not to expensive
other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability
i ordered two of this item on 0318
constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough
i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks
the princeton amp emulation is sweet
i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer
think of it as an affordable boutique amp
but very good for a bag
ive used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d18 for several years
easy to use and handy for any string instruments
the price was  awesome
another winner from planet waves
for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand
this is a very good ts type pedal at a great price
havent used enough to see if images wear well
looks great in my fender squier
i play bass with these and they have a unique tone
i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings
tip  these picks are great for high actionhigh gain guitar solos
i never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor
i suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside
theres nothing to write about
this is a major plus for such a tiny inexpensive amp
i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together
keep a couple of these in the bag as spares
or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone
this is how basic chords relate to each other
an investment in your musical future
this educational device is truly an asset to all musicians especially guitar players
worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased
so the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker
i just got it and tried it out
not much but a little
i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again
they fit just not well
this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars
you do need to hit only one string at a time however
but for the price you get what you pay for
at least thats what it says on his website
i will purchase again for my next build
didnt look tapered to me and i cant use it
they look play and sound great
im super happy with my joyo pedals
hands down my absolute favorite pick
the big question is 34why
some guitarists will love these
was recommended to these picks by other users so i gave them a shot
with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers
and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price
nice foot switch for the mustang amp
these are a good value for quality strings
made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
this is a good looking strap
get something better that doesnt twist up an ravel into knots
but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a dropin replacement
its price is attractive as well
it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board
not by any means actually
and its exactly the same
i currenty use two types of capos  the kyser one and shubb capos
surprised me because its a largetoothed zipper
the tool is extremely useful
price with amazon prime is a good buy
the 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound
my bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors
they do seem to stay in tune well
the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd 500 are amazing
people that say it is loud arent kidding but there are limits
went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle
and the carrying case makes it very portable
definitely a real good value for the money
i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension
i have an electro acoustic martin second hand but without a scratch
does what it says it will do  keeps your strap locked on
the arms are adjustable so the instrument wont rest on the pegs
the material used is fine
not too much to say about a cable
gaskets can take care of that
it doesnt come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like
that is just unbelievable in my eyes
and yes i double checked the packaging to ensure i was shipped large
and during the time ive tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars
solution  hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive
this is a great practice tool
other reveiwer complained of the excess space but thats what i wanted
i like them and so does my music teacher
a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband
ill update this review after ive had some more time with it
they are good quality screws
definitely worth the price you pay
has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use
to the point where its nonexistent
downloadable presets on the internetconsdistortions and overdrives are pretty meh
for the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life
worth the money and is built well
great stand holds my mid sized keyboard up very well
think about it if you dont get it
they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment
price seems high for what it is and vs
for 10  which is also half the price at your local guitar shops
great for the dedicated guitar player
some have noted the zoom doesnt have speakers built in
i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit
yeah i think i did
i bought this to use in childrens church
true meaning of the us dream
cant ask much more than that from it
the stand makes my setting professional
if you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbing
imho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording
looks like made of good materials
this cover does not fit a full size acousticelectric hohner guitar
i bought mine used three years ago and it works great
i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon
i have a blue voodoo all tube amp
nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq
these danelectro pedals are great quality for the money
nothing to complain about here
this pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly
anyway i decided to change the strings because its been so long
goes up and down and tilts back
my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable
is there anything else to say
check youtube theres plenty on this great price pedal
coated strings are a simpler alternative
aquila seems to be the most popular now
i have always loved line 6
boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac3
the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins
it looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes
very good quality cable and plugs
they dont squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool
these are the best strings around
well ill man up and buy something else
these nobs fit great and look great
maybe i should get that for cheaper
then connect output of the ditto to the amp
it has low noise clean soundgood transmission
i love the colors and the matte finish too
update  the letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly
you cant go wrong with genuine fender parts
try to turn it up and you get bad feedback
bought it as a gift
i purchased 2 of this set and it works great
once together it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably
i run this direct to my digital recorder
took a bit to get used to but they are very playable
i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it
nice to have in your gadget bag
i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it
the metal housing screws into the jack
promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure57 stays in one place
i use this with my mobile dj equipment and it is fantastic
does the job and does it well
i dont know how eminence did it but i love it
plus the price is great
but its really worth the hassle
dont be in a rush
here are my pros and cons
my friend has commented on its bright color  youll never lose that thing
both sound good but these last a couple weeks longer
its much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables
these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality
i always say half of video is audio
this string set offers typical daddario quality and value
the exl110bt strings are about 500 a set
i was really worried about scuffing it up
i needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs
researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the shubb
i bought this right angle 10 red cable for my older ibanez guitar
but thats sort of what youre getting
i would love to have a baritone uku of this same design
sounded lovely for the first hour thats why two stars
however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors
no buzz andor other noises noted
i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon
does what it is suppose to do
the switch is a click metal button similar to those used on mxr pedals
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them
also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aesthetic
a classic that will surely live on
i play morning noon and night
although my overdrive sounds good
i am very pleased with my frontman 25r
another strength of these is durability
got this for an sgstyle guitar and it fits with plenty of room
works for me in fact i bought another for my classical
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
this is what i have needed for many years
i have a real problem with these patch cables
but im still giving it 5 stars
thing is great for multipedal use
item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price
so im sending it back
although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder
whether you get brass or glass is your preference
i compared these and other daddarios to other manufacturers
they do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient
today i had one of those finds
can be folded for easy transport
and the truss rod adjustment is perfect
nice tone and good quality
the sound from the 65 speaker requires some space to develop
fits about 58 guitar picks or so
but this strap works okay with it
i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics
using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
on the mandy absolutely no problems
i have a set of the original locking tuners on a 84ish strat
i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people
no cheap way is there
out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output
my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these
aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
the color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color
i love these picks especially in this gauge
anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices
i hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries
i have to type more
its a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup
you can eg your amp to compensate for the difference
it arrived well padded in a double box
not good if you were using it in a performance
i started experimenting on strings ill try using bronze strings
i would pay this price for just the element
the stand arrived very quickly
this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal
tons of useful information on this wheel
ive been extremely impressed with all the different amp models
ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago
this is what it shows a simple small mic stand that dont fall over
there are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds
i play standing up 95 of the time so these are a necessity
people set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall
theyve got a great product for the price point
change the strings every couple of months
fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase
i love the quality and the sound
i also use it to tune my violin and it works great
single layer of fabric providing no protection
you can pay more but i dont think you get that much more
it has no headroom even on the 5w setting
this product as advertised did not come with any picks
theres nothing not to like about this capo
everyone who sees it loves it
the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings
i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more
ive gigged with it and it sings well
this makes sliding on the bass real smooth
very simple to use for overdubbing
and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use
im hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension
good unit for the money for sure
not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso
so i wasnt choosey about the colors i got
the leg that you can use to prop this up isnt very usable
stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal
youll need to buy an xlr cable on your own
they work and are cool looking
simply slide it into position
can be fixed with some oil
replacement pads can be bought on amazon
this instrument sells for about 100
it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks
this one is good just that i regret paying so much for it
does lengthen the strap a bit but works
martin knows what theyre doing
i hadnt played any of my string instruments for some time
im using a ts808 in front of ocd
these really are the best tuners out there  you should get one today
and how it goes out of tune fast
i couldnt ask for more
i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program
its a very well designed capo
it has given me no problem
and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this 34leaning stuff
for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever
heavy to travel with also so i dont know how much ill use it
moreover theres also a warranty for this item
for a comparison mic i used an akg perception 420
a must have for any guitar player
they are the best out there
these strings are really nice
i spent a lot of time on amazon reading reviews  comparing prices
you probably already know what this thing is and what it does
its supposed to be very reactive to your playing
i did work very well and was strong
fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick
i did not know that these cables actually made a difference
it makes restringing way easier its pretty stable and sturdy
definitely recommend these over any other string trees
those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work
this may sound silly but just to let you know you can do it
i like emeven if they are purple
small compact functional and it works
that said the only thing i like about this order is the case
it would be great if it had a steel shaft
ok all thats good so why am i disappointed in this unit
it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table
they are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable
yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for
i point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and gibson electronics
ive used these strings for longer than id care to admit
the adjustment knobs dont seem to do much either
i did not think that an amp this size would sound good
my last thought on this this is a secret come closer
all in all im very pleased with the dg ghss
you check the tuning and its tuned alright but why isnt it sounding right
you cant go wrong with these were ordering 8 more pairs
youll either love it or hate it
just suck it up and buy a shure sm58
fortunately ive another plus a korg and an two intellitouch
i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center
wood finish is nice look on the wall
i have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars
these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used
its pretty fast and accurate for its price
i am self taught guitar for about 15 months
second time buying the 6 pack  great deal for the price
planet waves aka daddario is a wellknown name in guitar accessories
i have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now
at 2000 this bag is a steal
im using it with a fender eightyfive solid state amp
i just got it today and havent spent too much time with it yet
tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies
its a very cute little capo
good feature for the price
i just started in april after taking vocals for a year
easy to use  it is what it is
i bought two sets of these for two of my fender 4x10 bass cabinets
but just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet
this is not a gigging pedal
you get what you pay for in this case
basically its a preamp that sits on the floor
most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man
i wasnt all that happy with this strap connected to a les paul
all a at reasonable prices
by the way this unit comes with a 9v battery
its eco friendly and nicely packaged
if its an instrument the sm57 delivers
if you are looking for a regularmedium string these are real nice
five stars all the way
thats one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals
long lasting and great tone besides
he said he loved them
is the the best pedal ever
not cheap quality at all
my 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks
i like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std
they were a perfect fit
this has an output of 300 milliamps
i can put 6 7 picks on it
the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome
if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets
these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are
so all i can say is that it is working well for me
and the thing is loud
i think this monster cable sounds fine
noise gate used to be always available
i use them for everything from full band to acoustic
a good moderately priced guitar stand
itll protect your mando just fine
these original bullets are great for my strat
however it is handy for short solos
they dont play at all like what i was expecting
it seems strong and stable
slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter
i like their full sound and their lasting tones
love the colors and the price cant be beat
i wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didnt
the sound is very forward i would say harsh
check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord
that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp
for the price this is a fantastic buy
i highly recommend these for around the house use
ive been playing rock and blues for over 40 years
it works great and is very easy to use
a lot of harmonics and output captured
these work just as well
it is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects
this has got to be heard to be believed
these cables are the only cable i will ever use from now on
got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this
it gets thumbs up for the soundprice ratio
this neat little tuner has it all
but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite
well here it is friends in all its glory
over all  this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag
i have a fulltone ocd after the zoom
it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain
dont upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level
i love these strings they never stop amazing me
kind of a gross plastic smell
upfront the pedal sounds great
application method is also very useful
its a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff  love these patch cables
a couple of bucks more than dunlop
you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick
i always buy this brand
i recommend this multiplug to everyone
the chorus effect is a little weak
for less than 4 you can see if they work well for you
crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous
but it does the job and its well made
they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks
i have always loved hercules products
i dont even touch my morley anymore
small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case
this amp is a ton of fun
ill stick with dunlop gator grip
it was 4 dayspast the delivery date
then this will make transporting it easy
the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change
this is so darn cool
sturdy material nice draw string to close it up
of course it doesnt stay long because it tunes fast
every once in a while ill get a 34dead34 string
this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars
basically i use this for everything except winding strings
i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best
fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed
i usually have a guitar on it all the time
i have one of these in every one of my cases
small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc
if i ever need another ill be getting another fender gig bag
nothing like those 5 cheap straps
with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while
its crazy but that is what i am experiencing
i tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs
the finish is a bit more orange than pictured
the dunlop is well made as expected
it does not work well with a daisy chain power supply
to the people complaining about it falling over
but for my purposes with a 3gs it is a brick
to my surprise i hear radio noises
using  the 12vac output on my fuel tank chameleon works great
i purchase this hercules gsp38wb ag guitar hanger for my yamaha 700
im using windows and i have to suggest using the asio drivers whenever possible
now with my boss rc3 i can do it any time i want
a very attrative complete assemblage of blues harp
long lasting and backed up by the company
well worth it for the price
this little dude weighs next to almost nothing
but ill be going to coated strings next
since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the dd3
i use this cable a lot and it has stood the test of time
the case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush
also this thing is huge for the back of the neck
they do get warmer than id like
my experience 1 try to install from disc
so i tried this cable and it works perfectly
works greatgreat little tuneri would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner
they hold the strap on just fine
i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it
if you really want to go for something a bit more 34marshall jcm900 like34
i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work
they play great have nice action and tone
just dont put too much weight on it while using it
thats it you arent going to move stretch or step on these cables
even nimh 12v batteries can power this although alkaline 15v last longer
purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me
im using on one of my cheaper guitars
lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound
they have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark ernie ball feel
it works as well as expensive tuners
it is not going to come off because its that good
i would purchase them again
then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware
i repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikes
angled end is a good fit
theyre just as solid as the pricier ones
built to last and it is a shure
yes i think you should try these
what else can be said about them theyre good picks
however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy
ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years
and for the price this is a solid 4 star amp
one certain advantage of the sm58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability
this pad is great for midi vstis drums queuing and its got great action
the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch
arrived quite quickly but a tracking number wouldve been nice
this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and id buy another
tip  a little goes a long way
strong as a tiger tank
it is just not a good stand
but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you
ill update this review ifwhen it breaks
i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons
although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful
i am still using these everyday
good string action out of the box
i just ordered three different guitar straps online
this string is not muddy sounding like many flat wounds
size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable
not much to say about this one
for its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playing
great deal for the very low price
in fact it likely even adds bass to your sound
the vibe sound doesnt get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2
it is exactly what i wanted for a great price
good luck with that chore
want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good allround metal tone
ive used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces
they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding
the leds are a little cheesy compared to the old one though
got gold to remind me it is for six strings
i didnt know headphones could sound this good
im glad i chose them as they play easily and have a nice sound
send them back until you get a perfect set
snark has a good tuner for low price
they are stainless steel and very smooth
other than that a wonderful system
i only recommend it for something light weight
like i said theyre nothing fancy but they get the job done
i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n
it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot
ive been using the blue tortex picks for about 14
kit that finally went bad
there are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that
maybe but imo these are the best sounding strings ive played with
but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem
my little  vht special 6 came alive with this speaker
i think the amazon price is the best youll find
the controls are accessible and easy to adjust
the pickup is very over sensitive
i shouldve bought this to replace the original switch from the start
took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron which recognized it immediately
the mic preamps sound pretty good  clean and relatively quiet
i play either a martin ae thru it or a strat knockoff
first lets get the easy stuff done with
definitely got what i wanted
cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke
this is a fine bag for a guitar i got it for my brother
the edges did not catch completely  and it looks terrible
i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay
use a shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing
i am average build and play a strat
the ocd gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone
not bad for the price they have it for
there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups
i highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars
the leather feels a bit cheap as well
whats the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast
whatever the name this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp
unless you dont really use boxes
the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting
i love this pop filter
so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least
the sound i get with it is very very cool
i am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases
an opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective
dont lose the wing nut though
i will have to fabricate some protection
does it wear over time
now whatever number im on is the reference number for that drum
i have 4 of them
this is the answer to your all your power supply needs
this is pot metal as well which again is fine
ive been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that
it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot
i dont think you could get a better piece for the price point
basically this case is very sharp looking  made with good quality materials
it is thinner than a normal uke about half the body depth
first off the amp shipped with bad tubes
however these ones are great
have had one for years
as others have noted there are other better capos out there
oh and the return process
as an acoustic guitar player i think this is a great product
if i get a new computer i will update my review
so potentially i could have 40 plus pedals in a chain
but that is honestly to be expected
even from some big makers
easy to use and economical product
it has the perfect balance of flex and strength
pros  it is small bright well built and works great
as a beginner these make much more comfortable
overall for the price it is an incredible value
the other quality thats noticeable is sustain
i have a epiphone les paul special ii with a fender frontman 25r amp
so i took one star away because of this problematic issue
too bad they made this decision imo
what more could you ask of strat knobs
its well laid out and easy to get to all the settings
if needed in the future i have these extra plugs
it has a nice resonant sound good playability and very attractive finish
otherwise pick these up  great price and certainly gets the job done
i like this so much i bought 4 and going back for more
i also purchased the ac adaptor since these things typically eat batteries
sure theyre a little pricy but hey
capos are not something that i shop for
dont hear any anomalies in the audio
acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one
they work better than tuners costing ten times as much
typical neck bores for tuners by brand are shown on the warmoth site at
overall this is an awesome product
i would much prefer a round base
ive been trying different strings for years
ive run my strat tele and taylor t5 through this
i highly recommend this product
especially for the 100 tag on it
from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit
happy with it  like it
im very happy with this set
i have bought three of these
makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy
come on i wont bite
a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient
the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright
this is such a simple great tuner
i have been using monster for years
product is a solid build and prices right
these strings really are special
nothing bad to say its a fender strap with the hard rock leather look
i got two of these but wish i had got better ones
you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs
any skilled guitarist knows  to use  extream  caution when tuning
holds it in place and are of high quality material
but otherwise a wise and good purchase
just give some days to tuners to get used to
however my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely
i like this one a lot
the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed
mine is modified with the monte allums trigain rectifier modification and its absolutely killer
it is cheap and very has a good range of tone options
driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones
this is as simple and as reliable as it gets
solid attachment to bass drum
this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied
so if we can save a few bucks here and there it helps
but again the amp is plenty loud and fullsounding for its size
im raising my rating and the result
arrived before projected delivery date
it looks like it will last too
i have not tested its wind screen capabilities
it works just fine and im happy with it
i cannot do it with one hand
through sweat dirt and cigarette smoke they eventually start to look nasty
i bought the case for the case not for the included harps
best distortion i ever used
they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner
a simple modification but bordering on genius
but with every positive theres usually a negative
because the slinkys are perfect
this is more of a toy than a good pickup
it also works great for any instrument or sound system
i have to lug an 88key weighted piano around so dont mind lugging this
the primary draw here is the bright lightup display with wide color bars
in general is does tend to get a little noisy though
works a charm on acoustic guitars havent tried it on the electric guitars yet
im not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing
they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone
i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker
this has more features than ill ever likely use
my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand
i am so happy with this amp
electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are important
i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not
average to 3 i guess
but i guess its close enough considering the price
definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised
these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite  and theyre cheap
but maybe that saves on battery life
they are wellshielded look nice and handle well
great buy i am happy with it
i now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars
it is great for a quick way to get electrified
that is the reason i did not give this product a 5 star
the handle extreamly soft to the touch
holds my cordoba in position perfectly
that also means a bigger readout
youre more apt to grab your axe and play more
i recommend messing with it quite a while
they really do help with speed and accuracy
these picks are nice but just  too small
this tascam interface works great with pro tools
i almost sent them back
i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin
if you bought rocksmith 2014 and use an electric guitar get this
one of the best stands in the industry
otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed
the natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrified
i will still use a strap lock
34  but i lost it
forgot to mention the nice packaging
reverb sounds great as well
im just running out of wall space and money for new guitars
ive never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few
sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound
very nice grip on these
i wrote the company described the problem
its getting the job done and i havent seen a better option
first it works extremely well
just arrived in good shape
i think it works great
the bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut
tons of sounds and it can be 100 edited to fit your demands
a lot of students cant read or notice such small type
the string cleaner is nice too
not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about
the design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy
but it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all
i am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar
a great move toward a new generation of capos
so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money
i wasnt happy that its form was deformed
it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already
i like fender bullets on it
for some folks this will be fine
when you record singing you need this to prevent the pop sound
the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over
it is worth the money in my opinion
on the metal channels it really drives the gain over the top
they make the notes sound like bells
dislikes   quality of chinese products is a crap shoot
that increases their resale value so the tool pays for itself
which never picked up the phone
they sound great and id purchase them again
enhances string life and tone
my daughter is learning how to play and the
the only downside is the same as with most capos
but when the humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements anyway
cant wait to see how it does after it breaks in
we bought the pylepro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma230
somehow i had gravitated over to other brands including martin and daddario
i stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good
this pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless
the demos on their website show how simple it is to use
what can one say about a cable
in my opinion it is worth the money
does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive
the only reason i need to buy more  i lose them
it adjusts to fit different guitar necks and just sort of snaps in place
i didnt realize it was so small
at this price how can you go wrong
it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine
but these seemed to work well on the guitar i was restringing
the sn1 senses frequency through vibration
7mm and thats just right
it also worked perfectly on my roland rd300nx but i expected that
i did not  expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitar
medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me
i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses
i would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars
this guitar sounds even better
otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great
its just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph
i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value
its lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes
i think its a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly
if you cant afford a better guitar may be worth a try
i would rate the sound 5 stars
i also own an olympus ls10
luckily id also picked up a package of these ernie ball strings
what would that equate to  in hours
double dog dare ya to do better
i dont often use picks but when i do i use these
just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last
now i have 8 channels of automation  stop back record play etc
i guess they think you need big think strings to produce volume
i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars
i am new at trying to learn
these cables work very well at transmitting sound
since ive had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it
does it damage your instrument
i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different
try reversing it and youll see what i mean
i used to lose a pick every other day
why you would almost think i know what i am doing
i tried this but ended up going back to tortex
i dont like the feel or sound of these strings
and ive certainly seen quite a few worse
i have had good luck with wd40 too but it is very flammable
the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold
these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing
at least the hardware in this one is up to spec
not worth the time   to send it back to amazon
it is accurate and easy to use
i would recomed this product to everyone
i paid only 29 and it is small and convenient
noise reduction these are absolutely stellar at noise reduction
this is a pretty cool item
i love this mic as an indoor studio mic
but once on it is great
this guitar tuner is simply amazing
behringer used to be known as junk but no more
in my opinion the ypg235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck
i would buy them again
it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish
the improvement in tone is in all the right places
i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic
a great buy for the money
the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is
its really not a 200w system
they keep you guitar safe from falling
this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal
tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over
this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm58
sure enough the lining is soft and wellpadded
this ranks right up there as the best money i ever spent on equipment
it isnt completely black though
we will never run anything other than this design going forward
does not stay in place well
comes with nice screw on 18 to 14 adaptor
you can dial it right in to get that srv sound
then tell me what you think grin
if not just buy a cheap about 6 adapter like i did
the leads are actually a little too long but thats a good thing
this pedal completed that task
however for the price it didnt perform
if i shove them in i cant get them out
rest assured ive voted with my feet
fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky
feels like its built to last
some other people have made the same discovery also
if you are stop doing it
they are not expensive to replace
the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys
a friend of my has one and i just found in love with it
the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble
cons its too heavy for my mic stands
probably better than any other light strings ive bought
good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have
i should have researched this a little bit more
the fingers in front hold the instrument in
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh
just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
this thing should sound louder next time ill buy a duncan pickup
after piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner
so certain compromises have been necessary
the one i received was completely useless
ive posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page
you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch
it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp
it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase
rhythmic u2 delays are usually around 350450 ms
as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price
the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does
sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved
works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables
the picks feel great and im having a good time
73 being my mainstays for acoustic  electric picking
plus its fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas
the action is set perfectly and i dont have any issues with buzzing strings
i just use them for different tones
so easy to use and portable and cheap
also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range
i had some noise even at moderate volumes
this one really fits my taste
i like these even better than the martin custom lights
perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard
the blue stuff will be more than enough
the fender and the deans were very nice
we have used this with an at2020 at2021
i would have preferred something different
behringer has done it again
probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs
it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal
its a boss pedal  so it is rugged and reliable
a good piece of kit
why do they sell an instrument with crap strings
this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to
i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great
i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros
so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing
i cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it
this small device has amazing quality
because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5
the software installation is optional
hey it gets the job done and thats all i can ask for
is it typical of jj to have more headroom
those are pretty crucial to a drumset
great strings and the best packaging
he would definitely purchase from here again
this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget
expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time
great sound quality and durability
plug  play with windows 8
this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there
it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the evs
this little guy fit the bill
genius idea that i wish i thought of first
i use these on my acoustic washburn and they stay bright for weeks
will probably have to manufacture something to replace it
the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera
i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever
a little pricey but probably worth it
im a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever
both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars
its very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar
i still am an sm7b guy
especially the acoustic version of these
i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks
i was surprised that it was good
bought one tried it on a pbass loved it
they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely
the highest i feel comfortable tuning these to is e flat
overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended
however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock
one on the east coast and one on be west coast
but this device is simple portable easy to use and just plain works
good for fast strumming etc
these strings i put on my taylor ga4e
i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound 1000x better
the xlr out goes straight to your mixer
the craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb
sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better
overall a fantastic product with a price that cant be beat
its poorly made with attention to detail
i got this for my grandsons squier by fender 34 size acoustic
the stand is sturdy too
the way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem
they do the job and they feel great
the bassman is another that is just off the charts good
nice quick release without having to tie anything
this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made
i think this is understandable though
all in all the h4n is a great field recorder
when i need another set ill buy these
one size doesnt always fit all
hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall
the only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming
i put these suckers on there and wow was i impressed
i just hope it works in the field as well
for these particular buttons i used a 18 drill bit for the pilot holes
if you dont run a 4ohm speaker you wont get all 20 watts
with that baby cranked i spent many happy hours in tone heaven
looks good on any wall
youd be better off with a couple of books and a towel
and if it gets banged up so what
again i feel line i work for dunlop
through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear
it was not dropped or abused in any way
i traded in my line 6 and also purchased a roland micro cube
im an true analog guy
the other are for me one as a backup
the picks go in and come out nicely
i purchased it for that reason
its a good one for beginers like myself
between 7 and 13 earns it 4 stars
pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well
it removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately
the quality of the sound moreover isnt badproviding you can hear it
i started to play the violin a few months ago
ive also got over a dozen capos dont ask
they worked well and were easy to install
they can leave skid marks on your pick guard
these are durable but i get some noise from the cables
guitar will never fall off a strap
lets get a few things straight from the start  i love effects pedals
but i received this uke defective
two disasters for classic rock music
the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap
and hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change
it also has a nicely padded handle
this is a great music stand
i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband
but the positions it allows make sense for 99 of players
i decided to give the dava picks a try
i also own bose quiet comfort 15s and ae2s and the grado s80is
surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board
great pedal for a great price
high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best
like many here the case could be an inch bigger
this audio adapter works perfectly
it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy
make sure the voltage matches
the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically
so whats the behringer xenyx 502 like in this use scenario
the weight makes it more sturdy
this does not mean i will not try others
i would say it muffles too much though
i got this from a direct from china vendor
for classic rock  this is perfect
can get many different types of sounds and drive from it
having an fx send is awesome when using it live
but darn it 6 paper envelopes
if you are looking for s nice rich sound this is it
however youll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse
so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked
it doesnt take much to work
use it every time i restring my guitar works really good
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
takes up less room on your pedal board
start to feel scratchy this is a quick fix until youre ready to restring
each one different in it on right
distilled water will extend the life of the sponge
this is a cool little amp
it was very digital soundingat this point i wasnt sure what i wanted
i believe its zinc alloy but thats fenders fault
no transistor amp i own sounds as good
well made feels very strong
i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up
easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service
as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in
what else is there to say
unfortunately im going to have to return it
anyway i have had this tuner for a few years now
thanks amazon for a great product
i prefer a string with a little more volume
they are made by taylor and all taylor guitars come with elixir strings
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar
the sound is great and it is easy to play
it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage
first off the shipping was fantastic
too hard to push notes through them
i have used it in recording live band practice sessions
for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables
at first the e overtoned the b and e
otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel
this is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
i like the g7th nashville capo but the spring tension is inconsistent
my other snark is still going strong
the box is very good quality with nice large controls and metal foot switch
the build quality of the super champ x2 is largely excellent
this is a very useful and quite educational musicians piece
great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered
but they are what they are
the quality is great for the money
this is why i give only 3 stars because is to small for me
the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out
they will last for a long time and they are a good product
the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy
understandable as it was made and shipped from indonesia
very durable and not uncomfortable either
the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke
works well enough as a filter once you get it placed
this mic gives a great range of recording purposes
but others know exactly what i mean
this guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there
i will try to add pictures when i get a chance
for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex
i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar and what a difference
turn in half way up you get a clean sound
as the title it works the way its supposed to
you cant get better than this
cant always get what you want
instead it was only 2 cheaper than buying at my local music store
ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job
you will not be disappointed
sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars
and yeah new 4 strings do improve the sound on a 20 uke
i play an acoustic guitar so i dont run around a lot
it is portable folds up easily for storage
just a little cheaper in cost perhaps
i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk
thats when i went looking at the cry baby
the output latency was a tiny 43 ms only
they were just what i needed
dont let the system absorbs you
i rub the entire neck down before and after i play
does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound
their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception
i dont think i can say enough good things about the samson sp01 shockmount
i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass
all of that said the strings are pure joy to play
you cant really do that with this pedal
i bought this guitar in 2005
i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug
the soft case is very nice also
this instrument might actually be in a class of its own
if you can find this for less at a local shop go for it
this is one great piece of equipment
im not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish
the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up
they even come with a clamp for your cable
i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise
i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball
didnt purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review
it works as well as other more expensive ones
the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable
very happy with my purchase
the only problem most people find is the material that its made of
very good buy great packaging earlierthanexpected delivery  thanks amazon
i dont regret this purchase at all
easy to use easy to see
for under twenty dollars pylepro cant be beat
the  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by gls audio
these will not be used much
other than that these are great monitors
you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case
easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em
its no toy its a real retro electric guitar effects pedal
this is my second set of these
minor clean up in post
headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems
fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 60 amp
being perfectly  protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it so
one person may love them the next may not
constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp
you wont be let down
i love these picks they are my favorite
great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars
dont forget to buy strap locks you will need it
some may need a clamp
if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet
this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion
its just unbelievable how well this device holds picks
ive heard the boss verbs
they work great  you cant beat the price
the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier
very nice product and fits well and good quality
this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is 34 size
i would recommend it to those who can afford it
this is a great little amp for practicing
plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips
all in all quite a listening experience
it did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall
hell even my cats cant do that and theyre porcelain
maybe all the people at tascam have really big heads
great stand for the price
i like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily
we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired
looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for
not noisy at all really clean pedal for your board
i am about 59 and a trim 155 lbs
i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners
if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long
they felt exactly the same in fact
theyre not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones
thats only my opinion and everyone has one
also has no affect on sound of bass drum
it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces
i also love the daddario make
these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners
oh maybe a tiny bit
the best nonrackmount reverb i have ever had
great feel leather matches my instrument well
but he has good taste
this product works just fine
nice bright and full sound
it is a ratchet rather than a clamp
the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable
easy to screw it on the wall
but i have no concerns after using it on two string changes
kidding aside this thing is really nice
im pretty impressed with it
super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables
i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these
i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag
perfect whether youre rocking a featherweight strat or a 16pound 6string bass
hell of a bargain at less than five bucks
they seem to be made well made
would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti
im very happy with this little mixer
this one is the best yet
a super cheap mono cable
press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing
that wasnt necessarily the case but there are other problems
my guitar room isnt super bright and its very difficult to read
right now this amp doesnt need to be tweaked for me
ive tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound
they are good to go
the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use
easy to adjust with a bit of practice
i get better harmonics with these strings as well
im sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a tingting
well padded and has enough carrying options
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks
i bought these to go from my board to the amp
overall i think this unit is a great value for the money
in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection
as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means
the graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it
i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware
there are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out
how in the world can they sell a very good microphone for 15
new firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects
they have all the features and versatility youll ever need
i dont think you can go wrong with this one
ive already returned the tuner
if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldnt be a problem
it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymore
no complaints with the crybaby
anyway two thumbs way up for the uca222
awesome tuner really fast and responsive
and it did but not at all the guitar contact points
the level knob has a lot of juice
it works but ill probably end up getting a better one
for a committed neophyte like me the ufo202 was probably sufficient
product does what you would think
my finger stays too tight
running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording
and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality
but it was what i was looking for
cant really compare to the others but for me worth the price
i will definitely be buying more
ive only been using the yellow one so far only just started using them
pretty disappointed in the color
inspires my ears to make music
this filter arrived very quickly
its plastic so dont jump on it
it comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos
i like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well
the great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost
this guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box
cheaper ones will work but i wanted to try it out
i have never had any problem with any of these items
one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are
i was surprised howsturdy it appears
ill always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board
love the color coding too
on this guitar they sound a bit too bright
you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger
pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly
it gets a great sound right out of the box
it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it
daddarios are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics
which i purchase through amazon
its also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use
this is unlike any pedal i have played
the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture
there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rocksolid
let me make it clear
these harps have no volume
its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off
messed around a bit and it started to work
this is my first set and i am impressed
theyve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings
i use it in combination with motrya gold
it could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps
able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily
to me daddario are just as good
there are snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars
this compares very closely to my high end od pedals i own
the guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case
more importantly the sound doesnt deteriorate with higher volumes
they do take some time getting used to
i was surprised by the size
i bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with
switches and knobs feel sturdy
really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it
it is just very wasteful for the cost
the software is a little lame and doesnt always work properly
dont buy the one from the store this is cheaper
brass tacks they are velour
i can think of a million simple solutions to that but thats another story
fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances
when it comes to noise gates this definitely does the trick
again light went out and back to the original
for some of you its still a viable option
the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box
i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones
its a great beachcampingcabin guitar
there are tons of effects
but no harm done still works great
you cant blame a chicken for not quacking properly
it does what it says it does
dont let the term 34nylon34 fool you
too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch
second these are musical instruments
getting demoted from the front page
trust this cymbal once and you wont be disappointed
this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal
it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment
im kind of feeling my way
it works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments
i use this on all my households guitars and basses
i had to tune my guitar and i bought this
it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully
i really havent used channel two much
i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul
it is built like a baton
my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size
so far so good not perfect but good
it costs 5 or less delivered
i love this thing and for the price you just cant beat it
i expected this to come with a dc adapter
will not hold a blue yeti  yeti pro microphone
i ab them both one after the other and it truly was quieter
the action is fairly high not uncommon with offtheshelf instruments
i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldnt be happier
in that regard i give it five stars
the strings stayed in tune
it has worked so far
the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob
this does the trick just fine
like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material
my old bag had more
i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet
it has a good seal also
they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great
product was delivered safely and promptly
there is no hum when the unit is on
great guitar string at a reasonable price
this is also a pretty handsome looking caseif thats what you care about
the only way to turn it off is to unplug it
slides are meant to cover your entire finger all the way to the tip
feels like wearing a 10 casio with a 1300 suit
its fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new
i dont think this is a true steel block
i would buy it again
double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would
it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power
this one is very good long lasting guitar strings
if you can wait for the delivery its a no brainer
exps make my guitar sound like it should
im happy with this product
fresh strings can do a lot for your sound
i purchased this key on a whim
little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bit
does its job very nicely
i would recommend getting strap locks
yes it will help you string your instrument quicker
does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do
first of all dont expect any new tuner to work as a dropin replacement
i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had
included with the interface is a 5 foot usb printer style cable
i guess you get what you pay for here
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do
i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal
this is my favorite light weight guitar stand simple and does the job
when my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced
i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying
practice amp this is the amp for u its definitely high quality its got
and the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it
i have four snarks and one other brand
i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either
over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made
so they might work and they might not
he has had other brands but they just dont stand up to elixir
this makes the guitar sound huge
in this case it is a winner
unless trying to use the jam
now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise
put them on an eric johnson strat
they are much better then the original strings
the 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone
its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it
this seller is worth supporting
i taught her the cchord and i play the gchord
quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather
but this tuner destroyed those expectations
they work well on my electric and my acoustic
yes and for good reason
sometimes i find it a bit too long but i dont mind
really impressed with this wah
i can say its pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer
i used it to connect my behringer bcr2000 in midi mode naturally
i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price
the action was a little high for my taste
octave  bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers
it clings to the gloss finish nicely
you end up using just the right ammount
so good that i bought another one
they sound awesome on my acoustic
easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end
i bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard
well i want to clear this up once and for all
if your looking for an small amp
i used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier
most have been in the 30 range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko
fit very well my mic
i would recommend this product
i really like these strings
this seems to be a nice rugged stand
ive had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing
the g and the d were fine
very high quality and a sleek look
fits the behringer xm8500 perfectly
let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide
it sounds just like i hear on tv and it sounds great
i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised
cant go wrong with tortex
depends on what you want
if theres a sale ill buy some more
so versatile light weight and well constructed
tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge
but i think the electroharmonix tubes sound better therefore they do
at2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality
2 installed driver on my old g4 mac running 105
these are considered boutique tubes but i think theyre popular for a reason
i guess i thought being felt they wouldnt be so stiff
the depth of  sound sounds great
still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy
i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar
love  love this guitar
the price is right as well
it also has a substantial treble boostlow cut going on
i love this little guy
its not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are
for the price very hard to beat this
the dp008ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp03 digital portastudio
id say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection
this is a very wellbuilt stand
the neck has to be thinner though
if fender solved that it would be perfect
individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth
i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes
i just play at home with friends
works great  keeps all my fretboards looking great
the finish is pretty and i like the solid cedar top
haha it made me laugh
the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me
it works as expected and has not given me any problems
i guess as long as both are still available exl111 being phased out
good bargain though for 699
you cant go wrong with this stand
overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs
i dont play these myself i bought them for my daughter
the main problem with this tuner is the usability
great that they have uniform tension
replaced everything but the body
delay  flanger phaser  tremolo  pitch shifter
certainly superior to the old school bandbased jobs from yesteryear
it has plent of volume which is good for boosting
they sound similar to the shure sm58 and we use them every day
individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion
they really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar
restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison
these provided an easy inexpensive solution
this strap is a great strap
adjusts easily and holds its position
it doesnt snap in place
it does not hypnotize beautiful women
from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed
i bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar
it is very annoying doesnt work very well and looks pretty dumb too
they help me pick up my guitars much more often
these strings are very bright and full
currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount
these monitors have 70watts powering a 5 woofer and a 1 tweeter 40w30w respectively
i recommend this cable without reservations
simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear
its not necessarily a bad different its just slicker and not as coiled feeling
may order more as extras
it leans wayyy too far back
when it arrived 3 days later it was a good one
as the title says these are a great value and work well
if your household is quiet this is very much a good bargain
in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it
the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension
i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice thats about half price
some people complain about the smell
the cm2 sounds great in both applications
the spring tension is just right
nice cover for my behringer xm8500
zero buzz across the board
i am sure i received a new case
but if your gonna use it live
the plastic is pretty lightweight but it is a big help
it is far superior to previous tuners ive used
under windows 7 all i had to do is plug it in
i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke
my first concern was will this damage my guitar
they are even and not warped like the stock ones were
the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tinlike
we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost
wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger
spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere
one of them was particularly great
cheap works great for playing and foot controllers
my acoustic guitars seem to like them too all except my 12string
the same company makes a tuning capo which i find handy at times
super great sound and super long life
now for jazz and metal i use this pick
besides what are they going to do
and the price is right
this is a nifty little tuner
only for indoor really light use
these were just what i needed
however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several
also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun
these are stiff thick and heavy
these are amazing little inexpensive mixers
it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well
excellent tuner with one flaw
i have four of these  and will continue to use this product
and it just looks better without it
no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidlymounted
its a tool oil that stinks
i have used this winder now 4 times
i have played guitar professionally for over 27 years
they all work and none of them have given any trouble
this is the capo to get
you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible
theyre easy to install i havent had one fail on me yet
i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs
the one that shipped was the cheaper shiny plastic one
i may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic
these 10 are not the ones he likes
this little amp is amazing
i keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times
im just learning what i want and what i need
very easy to use  clip on and go
basically the value of your guitar andor the age
constructionwise these are likely lifetime cables
for this price its another great tool for your arsenal
open cap rub across strings a few times
they snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality
340 holes in my allparts neck  theyre a little large
nothing on the market works as well as this
put these on my gl s500 electric
this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed
not as noisy better feel
cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel
i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing
i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
its barely audible but its distracting nonetheless
i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear
i am absolutely delighted with this tunner
new premium strings do make a difference
just a simple well made product that does the job
i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube
buy thisthese pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny
this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought
the case is very nice and sturdy
it only took me about half an hour
only needed minor setup adjustments
update 8212   ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric
that did not last long
right now it is the biggest bang for the buck
very compact size and easy to use
the great features are 1
first set one red plated slightly
much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning
so ill update should i encounter problems
filters out noise well when using the mic
ill wait and see how they hold up in the log run
thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon
this product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars
this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use
who would these appeal to
as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on
not sure why its not
for 29 bones you simply cannot beat it
i m obviously not a 34techie34
i have more use for an overdrive
the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me
i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it
i dont think you are gonna find a better microphone
things like strings and picks are subjective
its the latest boss delay pedal
this is as good as other devices that cost 34 times more
a nice little amp to rock out with
with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that
i have one in my main guitar caseses
it has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end
after reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what i needed
i found mine used for 20 but the new asking price is fair
this is the last of the cool from shure
it is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others wont
its so stinking small and thats what counts
its also easy to use
smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings
ive use it for years
i wouldnt reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage
about ten dollars a set which is really good
its a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful
personally i just love the daddario strings
you cant really get there without actual tubes being distorted
this gauge is perfect for my 1970 gibson j50
the straps have petabs buckles and are easily adjusted
if you want really good quality buy the boss unit
this is an awesome pedal
i wont rant about a string winder
it has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance
really am impressed with this gig bag
works great in extremely loud environments
this is a fun and very good guitar for the money
this low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked
really packs a punch haha
mine was shinynew and was an absolute perfect fit on my mexistrat
volume at about8 oclock and gain at about 3 oclock
this stuff works great and lasts forever
it is a good choice for a beginner
as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird
what a great little stand
great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection
they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the
and the pockets  oh the pockets
you arent even looking at this pedal
your really cant beat them
its a really good deal at the price
does what its supposed to do so far
it is a fender product so it is well made
i wish theyd just name the settings 34clean34 34overdrive34 34distortion34 and so on
these didnt show up so i contacted amz which goes back to godps
money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground
all of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience
todays modern guitars use medium jumbo frets
i tried all different knob and eq settings as well
cut the strings like they was made of paper
everything i would want in a gig bag
the angle for kazoo use is fine
this feels like a professional microphone
it has worked great now for over a year at least
one could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment
i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put
they get better with wear
ive used many strings and owned many guitars
gorgeous strapped to my sons martin acoustic guitar
i eventually put back the original el84s and that didnt help
this is a cheap extremely low quality strap
nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops
the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 75
not too tight snug but not confining
it is hard to describe the sound you woul dhave to hear it
either way dunlop is the best and for a great price
however it broke not too long after i bought it
however now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect
theyre holding up very well
it fits my need for practicing
never had one unscrew again
i do need a boom to keep the mic
a little noisy  but what do you expect at this price right
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated
if you own a dot sheraton or a 335 you should buy this case
buy one youll use it youll love it youll be happy you bought it
i tried it on bass and was really impressed
its my go to for chromatic tuner
both my hot rod deluxe and blues deville came with foot switches
this beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job
without the excessive hum and almostunusable tone control this would get 4 stars
havent used it for anything else though so cant comment there
at first it didnt work
i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these
for guitar bass or keys
after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself
i compared this against the fostex mr8mkii which i also own and like
the hde xlr to usb is ubs
these are fine but didnt fit well but they are a quality product
lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal
it came down to the ac15 fender blues jr and the ibanez ts15
its a decent pedal very solid
pro co rat2   great dirty distortion pedal
ive bought these daddario strings a few times because they are a great deal
the little limiter lamp is awesome
the construction is sturdy metal and actually heavierfeeling than a boss pedal
this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables
heretofore ive been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism
ive read some negative press about behringer pedals but personally cannot complain
its a feel good guitar
for me not so easy to get beyond the basics
definitely glad i bought this
pricey as far as strings go
good product good service should be fine for years to come
dont purchase this without buying a tuner
the interior was nothing special either
my only small complaint is that they dont use a center punch
simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines
but for the price they are great
it has more flexability than just a tone knob
what else could you ask for
item arrived on time and as described
i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt30
it should last a lifetime
just sitting on two other speakers
nice and stable for my classical guitar
i dont often capo my guitar
the seem to be all the same company
if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation
i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps
battery life is also pretty good
the gig bag is a square and softly padded
it fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle
recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun
that being said my go to strings are still daddario
i recomend trying one out some time
virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application
best buy i have made on a product i couldnt try out first
great little controller for your daw or whatever
meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee
smells nice and makes your guitar looking new
the price is right and the quality seems good too
call me a satisfied customer
this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball
cant wait to get it and i will review it also
i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting
are they better than the 100s
however i had to give the tuner a try as well
i own several taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars
seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price
recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low
other than that notmuch difference
so it easy to quickly tune up
i think black looks better with my guitar
the feedback is good and theyre stiff enough to strike clear tones
this is my 2nd or 3rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far
the couple more that came in had a wider slot on them
decent cables and arent too expensive
not one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night
i had some issues with this guitar when it arrived
a new batterry lasted me almost two years
after a time the pinch is bit much
i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack
well made tube with good amount of gain and highs
i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program
i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast
not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer
darn i meant to test before this review
dont hesitate to pick one up for yourself
makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise
i tried them back to back
plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately
the cradle guitar stand was for a friend
i like making my strings last longer
have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker
it comes with really nice looking stickers
you have to use all of the strings once opened
i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them
been using these cables for three months now
its easy to set up
not so pleased with the sound quality
if youre a rockgod dont even consider this why would you anyway
very satisfied with how it worked
easy to use very tight and doesnt get in the way
and thats a good thing
it is lightweight and feels sturdy
my plan worked and this is a good quality strap to do it on
its really the durability that sets these apart
i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap
might purchase another one eventually
works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes
other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal
if lost or stolen id buy another
i recommend this one to anyone
wipe each string when done and they will last longer
like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style
i tried the rest and returned to the best
it has a year warranty period
if your dog loves toys keep this out of reach
and it sounds great too even better than their wellregarded snowball series
and too hard to figure out
this is a beautiful guitar
my recording playback sounds like its live
thats another amp i was considering
by that time half the youtube video was over
they are comfortable but not as comfortable as id like
there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box
they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time
it drains batteries almost overnight
i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong
my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item
all my guitars use this quick release clip
the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated
have used daddario strings since the late 70s
the switches and dials may also fail over time
sooooo everything i said initially is still true
even the crunch button is just a louder sound
these strings actually save you money because you dont have to change em much
i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone
make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death
i bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection
he thought the guitar cost 300 above
a review mentioned it didnt come with batteries
cost a lot but well worth it to me
never using another tuner again in my life
you can run any number of power sources to it
always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing
but i probably wont get these again
most advice ive seen says try em all and decide for yourself
it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying
you may see it differently
theres also three switch positions  off on and fx
one for the stand and and one for a mic
the quality is really nice
the locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat
works as well as locking strap buttons did for me
guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features
5 plus stars for this one
right out of the box playable
nice natural finish all shiny and new
particularly with a clean signal aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells
its like the blue blocker sunglasses
everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well
the package was really well don e and arrived in good time
ill post an update if this speaker fails
im always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs
theyre 2 days on and sound fantastic already
the daddarios are excellent strings and this price on the 10pack was unbeatenanywhere
while waiting for it to come  i had to change one
neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to
but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with
therefore your strings last much longer
the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very wellmade
mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters
for the money this is one of the best products ive reviewed
its now my go to amp in the studio
i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one
go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s
used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase
i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting
for the working musician or home recording man this is great
they have become my favorite phones
it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it
bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter
some folks expect something different i suspect
the fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing
planet waves mandolin strap brown
i couldnt be happier with it
its a pleasantness that doesnt grate on your ears when you pluck a string
i actually have the same criticism of my tech 21 triac really excellent pedal
it wasnt even a little bit sharp
i can take or leave the kill pot
it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say
dont know why it didnt work just shorted out
but the cutters are great
luv the zip pocket in the front  perfect for strap snark capo whatever
it has a lot of power and noise behind it
rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off
you will not be disappointed
the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off
i cant imagine working without them
and the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other
makes my voice sound fantastic
forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too
but the sound is the problem
the unit does what it was meant to do
it does what it was made to do
they are beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play
i used this 3 times and it shorted out
this little fellow is great
this has also help me in tuning the violin
other people i know whove had this tuner have complained about lack of durability
small lightweight and very easy to use dose the job well
initially installed jj el84s after reading so many good reviews about them
it fills out the sound and yet doesnt add any artificial high end
and just switched the mics out
youll need to adopt a philosophy on gain
b  recorded dr40 and printed to cd
right product at the right price
fails with a 13082 googled the problem
going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate
cant go wrong for the price
the lower settings are bluesy  the higher settings are bright and dynamic
simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band
just buy it you wont regret it
another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists
this has the most distortion
the effects are beautifully done
these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness
the plate has five screw holes but doesnt look bad using 4
the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup
bad points  1 the package it comes in says its a 20foot cable
ill take ernies over martins but not over daddarios on my guitars though
as of 0313 the plastic seems pretty thickdurable
you can program it to whatever midi values you want
053 as compared to my old martins which went from 0012 to 0054
if youre only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware
keep it mind it is xlr for those that havent noticed
the dunlop does not have that feature
but for 20 dollars its well worth the price
my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks
all it does is make loops
i didnt like its tone so i uninstalled it
having color coded cables are also good too
for 15 you cant beat this
large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch
it is even large enough to use with my 12 string
but i just need to stretch them out
i go around to different venues and sing
id say it started to cut into spyder jam sales
the 63 spring is great the plate is also really good
consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision
my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery
the cry baby has proven itself since the 60s
i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught
i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style
this one is a keeper
for fun i added one of the tomsnare mics and they sounded equally clear
i knew i had to go cheap at least for now
i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well
now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out
behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality
i own 5 different gauges
but if it happens there will be an update to this
these are solid strings that never let me down
the quality of construction is absolutely superb
not much else to say it works and looks well made
this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound
seemed to want to be off too much
these guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing
so in short this is a mixed bag
the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be
thats what i do anyway
recommended if you are doing the beginner thing and testing the waters
you cant beat the price
i feel like i might accidently break it off if im not too careful
seriously are you a child
my last comment is in regards to the h4n as a usb interface
guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar
arrive on time and as described
i have no complaints about it at all
takes some hand strength to open it but you dont want a weak capo
no worries though now im learning my new favorite instrument
in my house i dont have to play quietly when rehearsing
second it fits great  does exactly what its supposed to do
this is one of them
you can never have too many guitars
the finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel
the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable
i like them so much i bought another one
a bit small for my preference
but if you like longevity and less squeak
what more can i say
the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to
it is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it
look at the other reviews and you wont be disappointed
this is really quite a fantastic little gizmo
my band had no pa or mics or anything
my favorite is still the g7th capo
so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain
for the price this is an amazing pedal
for the price this does everything and more
for the price the functionality is excellent
its got knobs and buttons
theyre great for metal if you like a durable pick
the device works as advertised
i have a collection of straps but not a black one
you also have to get ra taken altogether this makes it a deal breaker
ps i use it for my base though satisfied
i give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated
this pedal is no exception
installed these fender locking tuners and voila
this is a really amazing portable midi keyboard
these stands are just what i wanted for my studio
small enough to fit on any pedalboard
great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too
nothing is lacking to start playing right away
i would recommend this to anyone
anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have
no matter i wont be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again
so im out four bucks oh well
the strings are slightly smaller than the j74 and deliver a great sound
the snark is cheaper too
if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain
it doesnt feel like quality leather to me
this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting
it will probably last my entire lifetime
for a long time i overlooked my sd1 and used other pedals
it works great and makes this unit portable
used these for years on sons electric guitars
ended up i picked dr07mkii for slightly less
i am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with
this is what it is
buy one and see what i mean
they recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge
and 20 for a levys leather strap is a good deal
very secure effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe
i use this tuner to tune up my violin
so sexy with my sg
if it can tune that it should handle your guitar or bass fine
the audio jack on my laptop was failing
at 220 id have to love it to keep it
the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right
easy to play and they sound great
i didnt think id use it much but i do
its just not as good as i expected
these cables are just what i hoped they would be
there is enough in one bottle to last a very long time
a nice strap for my lower tier guitars
i believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs
they work perfect and look good
also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other two
for me the mic has been all its cracked up to be
i feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing
arrived on time and as described
for live performance this thing would be perfect
as a tuner i really like it
best recommended for starters intermediate and pro player
my kids were excited to split this pack of picks
i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc
they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity
my 1981 lucille did love these strings
for many years ive been playing with proel and 34fender34 cables
its a fact of life
paired with a chorus effect you can get some really cool tones
like all boss products it will probably last longer than me
next i proceeded to adjust the intonation
it doesnt come with a foot switch
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
then it stopped being recognized at all
this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me
i purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter
this gets the track started before it clears it
first a word about the negative reviews
the guitar fits it fine
this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings
it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it
i couldnt see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name
this is simply the ideal
the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring
best purchase ive made this year
i couldnt believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price
im pretty hard on my strings
the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great
it works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal
i just got done installing these
this is a good durable mount
i find the elixir excellent
turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see
see my other reviews on these pedals
it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit
96mm or prs 10 picks
as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average
it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps
at first thought it was broken but batteries were  not sitting in right
its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound
the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box
the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok
i have to say it works very well for the price
the snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat
definitely recommend this slide especially for its price
clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price
what more can you ask for out of a drink holder
also it clamps without bending the strings
stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely
i just move it around the house wherever i feel like playing
or play along to develop my chops
this is a very good and stable stand
so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables
sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time
used these while putting together my personal bluesclassic rock frankenstrat
and they are absolutely right
a nobrainer for fender guitars
it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes
i now have these tuners on an american strat and an american tele
i would recommend it to anyone
i keep hoping ill find something it does work well with
its routed hsh under the hood but looks tight
hold a tune very well and sound good
this item was purchased because im doing selfteaching on the fiddle
the movable head is awesome
there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles
wished maybe they came in yellow
i got about three of them
of course your mileage may vary
for desktop users heres what id do
i hope there had been a closer picture of the product
still they play so well its worth the cost of regular replacement
other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems
i was pleased for that
strings make a big difference in any ukulele
ive purchased many snark tuners
so am i complaining about these limitations
on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone
i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere
my precious uku will always be protected and look good too
snug fit for my mic
i love the freedom the g30 gives me
i would happily buy elixirs in bulk if i had faith in their shelflife
i can tell you what it sounds like
it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime
i knew i did right by buying the dr212
it is cheap to buy at amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning
they have a really nice sound and dont cost an arm and a leg
does not fly off the head when playing
this light is exactly what i needed
and yes pop filters are a must with condenser microphones
like the first one works great
you can pay more and get less
such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hds
this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market
one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune
it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m54 regal conductors music standquite well by itself
perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad
i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar
some things just dont need to change
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work
this product is simple does the job and is well priced
i love the very soft warm sound they provide
i needed to run my boss gt100 and vocals through it on stage
so far im getting quality recording results from this board
got a vintage instrument you dont ever want to see hitting the floor
again its a clipon tuner so dont expect razorsharp accuracy
stickies onto your guitar wherever
works fine and at the this price it cant be beat
i will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly
it works for me perfectly
ive had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite
an old school delay that works very well
there are other wonderful strings fremont flouros worths etc
ten bucks you cant go wrong
just to keep picks in my guitar case
bought as a gift for my son and hes very pleased with it
it also arrived super fast
they are the perfect size and shape
in other words great all around
they were a good price though and they fill a niche that i need
but then i needed a reverb pedal
the capo does what its does
this is thus far a good bargain
makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again
i would definitely buy this again
clamp it on the head turn it on and tune
unlike the edirol the h2 comes with a simple stand
it is solidly built and apprears road worthy
many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price
red light always stays on and ive never seen the green light
i brought for someone else
what can you say about a guitar chord
it provides great sustain and distortion
no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric archtop
i suggest ordering some better ones
i use it to cradle my electric guitar it works beautifully
they are not too big or too small
my first wah was a morley steve vai bad horsie
they are size 1046 which is just right for my electric guitars
the fenders straps are great
these are the best topping any other by far
they are easy on the fingers and i prefer the silverwound basses
i keep mine in a protective case when i am not using it
i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install
i use neither of these so i have no comment on their usability
would not hesitate to purchase this item
for this price its hard to beat
that didnt come close to working
if it doesnt take batteries thats fine but give me an adapter
actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great
these people just do not know how to read
i cant make that claim for prior speakers ive owned
threaded fine and its heavy enough for any mic youve got
each light has multiple independent settings
i ordered these for my husband the guitar player
that way i can shuffle through the presets with one stomp
you can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries
the idea here is to sound loud without being loud
so far ive been super pleased by joyo pedals
i can practice without lighting up the whole house
ive had this pedal for about five years
as long as your hands dont sweat a lot youll be fine with these
there are also output adjustments as well
to me this was a worthless purchase
i like the feel and the control it provides
ive had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone
of course those guys abuse their equipment
the string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns
you will not be dissappointed at all
maybe it is my locations but that was great too
if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device
great pedal and amazing value
for that application this is the windscreen to get
this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one
i took a chance and got this one and it was a good call
the classical musicians in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something
i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe
sent it back after one day
by todays standards thats as good as it gets
and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height
i highly recommend this product
not your average giant clumsy guitar stand but it works
the accuracy is as good or better than any ive used
i bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good
got this for a 15 year old learning guitar
i purchased this case for my newline 6 pod hd 500
the second probably flows from the first
i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup
these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price
i mean cmon what can you expect for that price
now it doesnt worksame day i got it
purchased to provide professional level io for recording from mixers etc
i will buy more if i get another guitar
i ended up not needing it so
they give them that extra twang
i wish it had a power button
this stand does the trick
the big name delay i replaced  in all honesty  wasnt as good
i gotta remember not to get the black ones though
im no expert but these strings sound good to me
as far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it
they look as though they come from the same factory
i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way
i have run both aroland rd300nx digital pianoandroland vcombo vr700
i do not hear any external noise
bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube
i messed with it for about 5 minutes
the neck is  well made
this is not a toy  a great addition to your mouth harp collection
it works with ableton live 9 with no problems
they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal
immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away
this is just a great product
i do like these picks too
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
they also wont mark up your prized instrument
this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box
i wear a large sized glove so assuming that would translate i got these
so looking around on amazon i found this handy little device
the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link
this versatile tool does what it says it does
i am very satisfied with these cords and would highly recommend them
they sound better more prefessional
out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive
they are solid durable and reliable and cheap as well
others found it awkward to attach  i did not
it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory
possiblyfaulty logic but i went with it at the time
i wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well
giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth
the case is solid albeit plastic
second is the mixer out
you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it
overall well worth the price
and little it is not much bigger than the jack
perfect stand as long as you dont have othersroomateskidspetsetc
at this price why not
very high gainfits in all size soundholes
i love the 90 degree connection
or to the desk where i sit and play
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
you can do a search there and hear what it is capable of
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
if you are doing more than just fingerpicking you might want to add pickshield
but these are great and you should get em
it was far better than i expected
variety of acoustic sounds possible
pros  inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal
this is a very nice tool
the screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar
very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure
this stuff honestly works very well
given 5 stars shipped on time and at good price
sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play
i am so happy with my changes
its comfortable and adequately strong
this gig bag looks really sharp and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying
i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome
for general home use though i wouldnt worry about it too much though
it looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands
if you dont know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack
if the unthinkable happened id buy another one in a heartbeat
the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up
these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guidetree
i think i paid around 495 for most of the ones i purchased
i am extremely happy with this purchase
i was looking for a financially good deal
right now i am just writing to get the required words out
this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly
this strap is really beautiful
the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar
getting he harmonica unto te springloaded holder can be a bit tricky
the tone as i say is pretty darn good
works well with the axl pg515
overall good strings and ill probably buy them again
this fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection
if used correctly this mute works well
im really surprised at how well they perform
it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port
in my humble opinion cotton twill is totally the way to go
this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar
probably good for strumming but not good for lead
it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway
too low and it does not sound right
nice enough that i wouldnt check it at the airport
this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad
it does exactly what it says it does
uses 9v batt or power adaptor
i have written other reviews about elixir
i can see a few years of careful use
ok this thing is cheap
they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill
none of us are record savvy or anything like that
ibanez ew20 body not neck dimensions  w 16 d 5 l 20
this probably doesnt matter to all of yall though
bottom line  this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price
ive yet to use that mic again
looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well
in my opinion this is a five star product
surely not but its the best cheap one
the carrying case is also nice
thats not pedal board friendly in my opinion
i neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect
the price is right and shipping was right on time
and it works on so many instruments
ive only ever dropped an instrument that had strap locks on it
a great bargain for a very sturdy useful product
ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly
i considered a few different brands and even other line 6 pod models
this is a great effect
didnt care for the behringer time machine
i noticed immediate result after applying first time
ive only used the string winder so far but it works well so far
i think it almost doubled in price a week after i ordered
wow there is a lot of space on this thing
im a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves
this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read
it doesnt sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest
this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps
ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain
this is a great product for a beginer
i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band
this seemed perfect and it is
if you own a guitar this is the best product out there
they dont cut the string they shear it off
the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens
im giving 5 stars because daddario makes great strings
i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii
mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket
you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc
its almost odish in its responsiveness
its one of the best purchases ive made in a long time
all it needed was tuning
definitely worth the little extra they cost
anyone else noticed different color leds
i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well
other than that an awesome amp
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment
arrived fast had them up and running in minutes
thats what i finally did and am still most happy with this device
for the price and selection and results works for me
being a studio owner i didnt buy this for stage work
hard to describe but if youre used to playing nickle youll notice the difference
50mm are perfect for me
if that time comes im sure this will be a great tube
it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with
i just got this and love it
i use it every week and it still sounds perfect
they may be more than the mando needs
puts on a good shine for your instrument
most definitely one of the best 34bangforyourbuck34 acoustic guitars
its perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously
issues not only continued but worsened
that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune
its a midlevel priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals
awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone
nothing at all fancy about this strap
it works like a champ
i normally buy daddario strings here
i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago
we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out
it came with savarez strings  not the best ive used but good
these are only good for garage practice on a budget
this dries quickly every time
electric thin neck vs thick etc easily
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner
it will increase in value to you at least
made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound
so many over the years i cant recall
not much else to say
i assumed incorrectly that both sides were black
my only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold
this capo is small looks good and works very well
these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on
though my playing still isnt very strong  the capo still is
i thought it would be resin or plastic
that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting
if you have a padded leather strap i dont recommend these
its lightweight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck
it has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch
this looks to be well built and should be reliable
im not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp
its small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus
i am happy with it
it should just take some getting used too
i just tested if all the plugs work and they do
i installed them on a korean made washburn wg587v
nowhere is it mentioned there wouldnt be any or i could have ordered one
i had the replacemnt in about four days
i got mine in a trade for practically nothing
you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response
it was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners
but it is not very good at parties
what a great little gizmo
this is of course via the front panel only
just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar
they work and sound good
the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button
it is a different feel if not try half rounds
the pedal is quiet and solidly built
microphone works well for acoustic guitars
just one bottle of this should last years and years
seems to work well though i dont know how long its supposed to last
will review each one as they come in from amazon
this combo is very rare
it requires some finetuning to get it work on different guitars
with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get
my strings stay in tune even better with this installed
nothing as good as even a ds1 pedal
they are just the most wonderful picks ive used
it arrived intact and ready to play
the pinstripe heads are amazing
these are heavy duty and well made
with the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedaling
anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed
i think it is a well made product and good value
i might try out the 28strand next year
i have been in need of a tuner for far too long
i have to wiggle and hold to get signal
i have heard that some are too long for it
i used this product and it really soaked it up fast
it also has a headphone output 14 inch
just pop filtering through black pantyhose
but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle
46 starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality
what are you waiting for
but trust me this thing is really good
it was a good purchase
i liked them better than these
i used a manual ratchet screwdriver
this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it
this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after
it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight
it is a nice strap
the last amplifier i purchased was a fender twin valve some years ago
about 2 weeks later i had a new cable
the lowend on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm
the capo itself is really good
its not some cheap plastic
this is a good item and has served me well
it is not that long but no complaints
regular on is basically like a standard lead channel
the knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough i guess
maybe try those but im sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops
it comes with a key so you can lock it
shure knocked this one out of the park
its made of serious aluminum and the spring is supersolid
not a whole lot to say about it
have these on my tele very interesting to play around with
my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use
my favorite is the 070mm
her reason for her opinion is simple
this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing
i was really surprised at the snark sn5 tuner
could choose any note since its chromatic
fantastic for slide or capod high
the string cutter works better than expected
it does not fix your transmission
the 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel
i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason
i can really hear the difference between new and old strings
i bought 4 and going back for more
i used the schallers many years ago
cleans up your gears appearance tremendously
no humhiss from these units at all
i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar
obtained free as part of amazons vine program2
that just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time
dont use the bridge pickup as it doesnt sound too good
id like to know the markup
several other combinations are excellent too
i love metal rock classic rock etc
i wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that
i wouldnt call them dull by any stretch of the imagination
i own several acoustic  electric guitars
has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars
im pleased with the digitaltoanalog conversion
that will do metal this may not be for you
this one is my favorite turn on and go
i absolutely love these strings
with the lighter varieties that would be far from true
my first guitar ever i am happy with it
great for vocals and guitar
however it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim
filter works very well and looks professional
do not use these or any other foam for that matter on nitro finishes
it makes you not easy to put back the mics
i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them
will and have used it since
its solid helps with mounting and will be well used
snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find
i tried these strings on my zager guitar
still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery
amazing strings they last longer feel better on the bends than any other
but thats not a complete comparison
i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar
same basic materials you cant go wrong with either
but this is a case of you get what you pay for
these are the only strings i will use on my les paul
very fake cheap sounding phaser but its all i need
you really cant go wrong with a set of these
the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp
60 to 80 hours perhaps maybe a bit more
it is definitely better for thicker strings
dont even hesitate buying this thing
so it was very much a lovehate relationship
however they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use
this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product
it was the strings and im very glad i replaced them with these strings
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
the promise is a 34bolder high end fuller low end34
works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks
i use this clamped to a table and its a superb product
my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led
there are better sounding strings yes
i dont ever worry that itll tip over
theres not much to say about this pick
a great add on to my student model for acoustic practising
this handles bass tuning much better
it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable
grip is the last thing you want on your strings
and it is fender licensed
anyway i figured since the pedal was so cheap why not try it out
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
select your material select your weight and youre done right
it does what is supposed to and it doesnt have a cheap look
very happy with this purchase
overall this is a definite buy
it is still a good dealtoday  if you can find one used
this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected
its well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market
there are 2 ins and 2 outs 1 balanced1 unbalanced on each channel
they do need 48 v phanom power from your board or a mic amp
very pleased with this purchase
it is a guitar stand
i am very pleased with this purchase
with no additional outboard gear if i didnt want
how do you beat it
this is your best choice
it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way its supposed to
easy to install also and for the money give them a go
bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction
perfect for its intended use
note  we have the burgundy color one
these are great did the job
however they tend to come untuned because theyre so susceptible to temperature and humidity
their are two issues with these straplocks that i have come across
now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it
check your guitars sound hole diameter before ordering
let your guitar be the judge
ive heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit
i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer 6pedal board
the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about 18 inch
they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks
i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle  nice
fender cords look great and work just as well
that is if it lasts that long
these microphones have a qualityfeel to them and they all worked perfectly
it feel like leather but i am not 100 it is true leather
works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand
wawa pedals come and go and get modded and rethunk
if you are picky these are all eye candy
so its basically like adding another channel to my amp
the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard
i didnt notice much of a difference between these and runofthemill daddario strings
returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass
plug in for a miccdm3 player
i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds
a little tough to get on
it was a pleasant surprise
im crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last
for me it was a good perchase
i spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away
i have no idea how itll sound with a solid state amp
made me a little cautious
i like the big size type
kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there
recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar
i ended up switching to their padded strap
i really hope its a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful
my guitars are now out of their cases and up for display
great buy prompt shipping great product
for that 5 stars easy
it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem
its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it
this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces
ive also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better
its cheap and the quality its great cant complain
it is very safe for guitar finishes
the cleans are ultra clear and the rock tones are amazing
this gig bag is well worth the price
the davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control
nano is small but quite durable
i just ordered 2 more of these
of course they will be elixirs as well
only annoying thing  the case arrived locked
easy to read easy to use
they fit perfectly on my schecter hellraiser
it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with
the price is fair and it serves its purpose
most of the band members dont mind them
focusrite should really have made a longer cable
i would if necessary purchase this item again
best ukulele strings i have found to date
make changing strings a whole lot easier
i love this little device
well built made to last and looks great
i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings
this amp really surprized me
great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
overdrive that wont drive you over
this dunlop 5005 pick holder work good
ive been playing guitar my entire life
i just love it now
for the price you cant go wrong
its a great idea but not well executed
both of those elements are present on this signature amplug
on its tallest setting this gives me the exact height i need
cons   very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days
i just put it on my baby taylor guitar strap
i have ordered several of these  like 6 or 7
i purchased this as my first guitar slide
i did compairation with somes i have its perfect vocal
i got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted
overall i like the tones this pedal spits out
great price from the seller as well
i bought the first about 10 years ago
folks ive tried them all from dean markley to ernie ball
i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector
all the capos ive had from kyser are still in great conditions
i dont feel i am missing anything compared to the medium
i would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze
it is like the swiss army knife for string winding
this pedal is for metal
i cant get the bottom guitar support to lock in place
when you remove the strap any picks in the pocket fall out
i put this in my fender mim stratocaster
compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board
this box is no exception
i got this guitar for my 9 year old son he loves it
in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57
those flimsy backless music stands are worthless imo especially on a breezy evening
when you need an audio insert cable you need an audio insert cable
read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many
this is the new and improved snark
else this is a really good choise
i had this misconception that my hands 34just werent designed to play guitar34
this is a good product
the snark is the easiest and most stable to use
this one is the worst
i cant speak to the string life
it fits my line 6 jtv variax in a very cozy way
15delivered is about the cheapest priceanywhere
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it
next time ill go for a vibrant color
acoustic and electric but not at the same time
maybe behringer 3031as or something
a guitar is an investment and you should protect it
the satinfinished cedar top is very easy to marr
works great and to me its cheap
its made in germany so it could be taken into battle
are you guys really hearing anything
60 dunlop tortex is perfect
the nylon is very strong i do not see it fraying in the future
simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain
however im not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic
this set of strings is fantastic
i read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the rogue
you can buy with confidence
it is not a horrible mic
im more blues orientated now and love it at the end
i was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin
the tuner is easy to use
these sound good on my electrics
it comes apart quite easily
dont have adhesive to bind on the surface
placed one in a fender blues junior
i honestly cant say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal
lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors
as the title says it works
first i dont know how they sell these for the price they do
another reason why i love this is its noise free
this little mixer gets both of those jobs done right
its my own fault for not looking at the specifications
the latter offers the now popular xz mic configuration but theyre fixed mics
it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have
the mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand
why buy this after the experience of the others
i really like the h4ns design the menus and controls are nicely organized
its definitely a great value
these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing
it also fit my tele to
probably would be improved with a set of aguilas
i would highly recommend this to others
i think it would do fine in a live setting as well
they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome
the bands on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job
i deduct 1 star because the loud feedback
ive used daddario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic
nice feel to it and seems sturdy
been using this brand of strings since 1971ive always been pleased
no audible hum detected when using this mic cord either
it is very precise and accurate leading you to perfect tuning every use
sonically i found them to be the same  or to my ears anyway
kind of somewhere in between
i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot
i dont have to guess or squint
the soundis full and fills the room
a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality
overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
semiaudiophilea bit bass heavy but overall great headphones
so in the end 45 stars
its a good product works well and does what its meant to do
fits my fender well looks amazing
could be my system could be the preamp otherwise no complaints
this was exactly what i needed and worked out great
lets be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes
they just seem to sound better to my ears
s display to be more than sufficient
multi color and easy to use
the mustang 1 was a great buy for another great fender product
the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard
in fact that may be saying too much
i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself
ive owned it for a while now and havent had any problems with it
rest assured electroharmonix is good stuff and the price is right
and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks
this thing will test most all the cables a musician will use
most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust
it works for a metallica pantera type sound
al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto
works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises
i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal
i have used monster cables for years and with good reason
i dont need to worry about batteries any more
i use this often to record my bands gigs
i ended up switching back to the 12ax7
on the plus side for soloing you cant go wrong with these
ive used all the roland cubes that are battery powered
buy the 20w version which is plenty loud for home
i got mine for use with some behringer mics
it does a good job for the price
of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably wont care
theyve inflated to 160 and thats just ridiculous
this was maybe 10 years ago
now i can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2
thus any uke that is concert size or greater
after each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers
now for some down sides
no need to find a special driver either
is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence
if used with an amp maybe
i bought a cheap 34 guitar that sounded really bad
actually it looks like used pedal not like new
thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded
overall this is a great pedalboard
to all heavy music guitarist i highly recommend this one
everywhere you read these are the strings to have
great value and quality for 11 i spent ever
i just bought a zoom g5 and it works great with that
and it looks great too
favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt thats flexible
i am using it with a seagull entourage mini jumbo
cables are good my only complaint is the connectors
cannot beat the value for price
i was able to record a whole song in no time
but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok
wow wow i cant believe it working wonderful
even when detected by the software it will not work with line 6 equipment
for one thing this is a guitar ill always enjoy having around
but i only use my favorite strap
excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise
i have three mic stands with this one being the fourth
one of the best  accurate tuners that i have ever used
i cannot shower enough praise on the lpb1
it works great with reaper
i am happy with the purchase
i like it works really well
i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars
the strings that come with it work fine and none snapped
the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze
the pro line shures also hold their value well
amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs
i stink at writing drums
it compares itself to the ts right on the box and for good reason
dont go for this for modeling
i like it korg has never disappointed me
but thats not a problem any more
i love this little tuner
i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a 6 practice cable
tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just ok to me
im very happy with this purchase
will be getting the amp in a day or two
bought this for my dot
this works and i really like evans
the effect is there then its not
from a construction standpoint these are remarkable for the price point
awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced
well they were right it sucks
because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well
i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon
its a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive
the fender medium is my second choice for picks
it worked didnt arrive dead
this strap is value for money
im updating a previous negative review
plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general
plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo
arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait
nice volume coming out of it also for 75 watts it seems more
nice to see something well made for a change
ive knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged
just leave the midswitch on the flat setting
handy well made small easy to see
i havent measured signal throughput so i cant comment on that
this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genzbenz bass amplification company
make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing
it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp
tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay
dont listen to the whiners
especially considering the price these are brilliant
sound wise these are great for their intended purpose
this pedal does exactly what my title suggests
it is very heavy duty great chrome plating
someone will appreciate it but not me
the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built
std power supply a plus
they all had pluses and minuses
it never needs to be removed
it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price
that being said using the looper was an eye opener
it is more decorative than useful
its compact has great voice pickup and audio recording clarity
plugged it in and it powered my rode nt2 condenser mic
i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles
moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool
every guitar player should keep this in their case
i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects
overall i found the available tones to be excellent
the face pivots around and the display is nice and bright
for a regular guitar this would be fine but not bass
these are pretty soft inside and fit most astyles pretty well
if you play mostly standing this is the guitar for you
im so glad my friend introduced me to this product
high quality solid support and good design decisions all around
this proved to be a good decision
dont write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind
they are very comfortable and easy to control
and this one fit the bill
high recommend this to any stringedinstrument players
holds my bass guitars easily as well
their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order
then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out
works great with my fender super camp x2
this was the first time ive ever used a string winder and cutter
all youll need to get your pedal train wired and running
as such i found them to be a reasonable value
very smooth action when using the vibrato
this was the easiest tuner i had
the hplp switchshifting into hp is almost like a gain boost
the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong
unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic
without those picks its just black molded flab
however it does not come with a cable
then the intellitouch tuner hit the market
holds your drink just like it says it will
change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument
this one is the best ive tried so far
a classic mic clip  simple inexpensive and durable enough
already planning on purchasing more
this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak
im buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables
at first i almost couldnt tell a difference between having it on and off
i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these
works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch
if you like warm old school tones youll dig this pedal
but then id go buy another one
although the snowflake doesnt use a spring clip it suffers from the same limitation
my fingers keep hitting the strings
they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country
they even work on cymbals if youre looking for a quicker decay
five stars for what it does at this price
think of marshall cleans or even vox
you cant beat the price either
the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever
this stand is worth the extra money over those 15 disasters
i tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars
for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the 30 price tag
and i still dont sound like alvin lee
mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping
this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing
they come unfinished but well sanded
i think it is reasonably priced as well
so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand
in a chain running into an amps input there is a slight volume increase
this is very accurate and also very easy to use
easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at least
i needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one
i like this very much and may well buy another
these make my cheap 50 acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my martin
easy to see easy to use easy to get used to
exactly as described and very affortable
not even holes for them
for 99 dollars  quit looking at other wah pedals
the other ones must be for some special type of music
unfortunately thats about all it does
these are really cheap strings but how they sound
is very sensitive to vibration
nothing fancy and not for everyone
yup its ok  nothing special
for the price they are worth it
they hold up for a very long time
dont hesitate to get one
great value good quality and sound
what else can you ask for
i will buy it again
pitch black is so cool
a backward sustain pedal is not fun
there are other brands but our reputation is at stake
no more battery swaps no more searching for a 9volt every 5 minutes
it sounds much much better now
does all i need it to do
this is not the case with the hd 500
the controls are volume off tone and overdrive
having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier
planet waves does make good products
kind of aggravating but no friggin way would i ever use another string
solid construction and great sound reproduced
you will pay up to 4x more for similar stands
simple solution to a simple problem
this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like
now a word about open back banjos if you are considering this stand
ive had this pedal for a number of years
what more can i say
it really saves on batteries and extension chords
the x3live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot
for those wondering about latency obviously theres some
overall i rely on daddario strings for all my instruments
i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc
after getting these the game picks them all up now
anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing
i think i payed like 8 for it so whatever
this cable works fine for my needs right now
i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
needed a boost with my headphones while playing rocksmith
i guess thats because they are cheap
not a huge range here
jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow
works for my behringer xm1800s mics
used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr
this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke
it came with entry level strings
anyway the pickup sounds very nice and im happy
but i love the gated reverb feature among all modes
the screen is also very bright and easy to read
looks great really classes it up in my opinion
not expensive was less than
im using this with an ovation balladeer
these strings are as advertised
i am editing my earlier review
i have not used it yet so i cant say much
the bag has removable backstraps for carrying ease
this cord did not work right at all
not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 13 its beefier
these are thick strings but still bendable just not very far
at the price it sells for i consider it a bargain
even without strap locks im comfortable going crazy on stage
i also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo
if had to do over again id pass
on tune and back to playing
in summary daddario makes good strings and these are no exception
these help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board
youll be oh so pleasantly surprised
mine was still brand new to me and worked really well
the price was great and the wattage was nice
now what to do with these other knobs
highest quality guitar ive ever seen in this price range
much better than trying to rolloff the volume
no brainer built to last and the carrying case its outstanding
it has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders
love the case and shockmount being all inclusive
the first issue is with thick straps
only used it a couple times so far but i like it
the travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself
its light and feels comfortable when you carry it
try the underappreciated md2 mega distortion or the excellent joyo ultimate drive
i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place
its so bad i just cant use it at all
its not that it does not have it just could use more
it is a good value
does it give you more sustain
like they were made for it
ive got 5 effects hooked up to this thing
at less than 15 you need to be able to look past these things
low settings not too echoey more like a bassd out reverb
oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
another quality product from hosa
they tuned right up with very little stretching
the title says it all
there is no need for proprietary or expensive strap locks
so far it has worked beautifully
they are clean cut smooth finish
it is not the size for mini guitar
amazine that it works off a 9v battery
overall dimensions 6 34 x 6 12 x 2 14
the color in the pictures doesnt do it justice
theyre easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii
its a great mic for the price
ive used this to connect several devices and the colors help
im in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play
its a versatile light source and i really like it a lot
these pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material
it doesnt sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it
who gets to play next
the adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees
two downsides both are about the noise
i like my phat strap just fine
these are outstanding strings with great durability playability and exceptional sound
i couldnt say that i loved it
if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one
they do look particularly good plugged into a marshall half stack
people ask is it loud enough to gig with
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
consider it for your needs
the sound is a bit brighter
ive swapped out the tuners and have never looked back
this is a quality product
not noisy at all so fits in with other pedals on your board great
you can not go go with a set or two of elixers
you must use a 9v transformer which is not included
this is a good guitar for the price
after taking my guitar lessons
i use these at parties and they work good for the price i paid
the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen
you could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed
i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner
it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously
im looking forward to using the scarlett more to improve my guitar playing
of course this would not result in 20 feet when its stretched
the design is such that they will wear well
so far iv used it on my 67 electrics and my taylor acoustic
this works just as good
is that this thing is heavy
this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects
it has excellent bass and treble tuners
i dont miss the amp at all
especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time
its a great price and its definitely worth the investment
hopefully there wont be long term issues
this power supply is great for me
as with all dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional
this is a future classic
i must say thanks to those reviewers
the long haul will be the test
the tm300 is more than just a distortion box
its different and just worth having to mess around with
the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case
i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly
i kinda think i am
i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it
i plugged it into a small guitar amp
crystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console
all in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly
very nice quality and very cool color to them
it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose
and why would i shop any where else
does everything i want in a personal stage monitor
seems sturdy enough to last a long time
guess thats why the price is so cheap
this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic
i love these  picks  im  defintley getting some more
you dont have to plug into it
cant beat it for the price
a must have for the yamaha pa130
its never worked properly since
i usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days
however animals could have been harmed in the making
just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper asian made
took awhile to get used to but really liked it
your sound will come out through your speakers as intended
i love this guitar string winder
but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new
these have not rusted so far
and it matches my tweed amp
they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier
the ability to control it with an external pedalswitch
bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal
again they work but theyre not aesthetic nor elegant
will confess that id like a 12string but thats another animal
cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable
i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in
i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust
i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable
there are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string
hosa cable gtr210 guitar instrument cable  10ft
i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly
the feel of suede is hard to beat
it gives wonderful string balance and sustain
they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version 65
i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away
i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats
the exp16s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic
ill be ordering from musicians friend again
id pay for a better one if i had to get another
these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads
these are basically the same as schaller strap locks
this is a very transparent compressor
i play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine
i own over a dozen overdrive pedals
using my dremel tool i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit
for home and garage entertainment is good enough
it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness
just a good basic cable
they add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk
i own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there
ive use these strings for years
i probably wont buy again for my other and future guitars
im not hot about their acoustic but electric
this isnt the best power supply available
if you have a guitar and amp you will need this
ive had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it
for the  its the best buy in my opinion
the truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them
this stuff has been around for years
its like playing a silk guitar
the jams improvement in avoiding feedback alone made it worth its price
been golding up an 88 strat plus that has seen better days
i have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars
they are smooth and bending is a breeze
it will give you a variety of bass tones
these strings did neither for me
plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and ive used just about every brand
it is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier
i also have a more expensive capo just like this one
unlike many tube overdrive pedals this thing has tons of volume on tap
its well worth the noney
2nd updatetried out several compatible tubes
i never cared much for the sound
it fits so well in my hands and feels great
it is great that amazon stocks these making ordering convenient
so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin
now it is easier to handle when trying to play
i was definitely not disappointed
the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control
cool tube piezo tone from my shencpk8t is dropdead gorgeous
you will not be sorry
i have a few shure sm58s which cost more
it boosts the guitars signal
100 e they have a
most real studio preamps are a good match for it
these strings did that just fine
versatile and great to work with
its usb connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity
my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a nobrainer
it tunes the harp fairly well
they seriously look brand new
if you need an 808 clone on the cheap this is your pedal
other then that it is all rock
i have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio
bought it after read reviews
i was using a nylon strap before i got this one
a quick word about behringer stuff
saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car
after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy
latest review downgraded from 5 to 3 stars
true bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are good
no complaints with this outfit
it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous
like most line 6 products some features are not highly apparent
nothing gets 5 stars  there are no generals present
i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom
vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular
not much i can add to the review that isnt well covered already
ive been playing for 8 years and i own 4 electric guitars
ive been using elixir strings for about ten years now
good brand and good tone
if bon scott only knew
since the string is nylon i gave it a chance to settle
these pick are cutting edge
he was happy with the cradle guitar stand
like many have mentioned this pedal is like a ts but without the midhump
i have a taylor ga4e
i am using the other 5 and they play very well
i doubt youll be disappointed
this really is a great deal
great price for the quantity
the photo shows no onoff switch however this does not catch any attention
also i have two epiphones
i use p90 single coils on my godin lg and these strings sound great
not bla bla bla this joyo pedals are the best any you get
perhaps the primary dealmaker or breaker  the tiny screen and small controls
these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable
not so  it was made heavier and nicer
perfect for my obscure use
cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine
i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day
after looking at 34reviews34 i like this one the best
it just might not be your sound
i have 5 sets to use up now damn
i really and suprisingly like this little gadget
it fits the guitar nicely
often times it even stay in tune the next days
ive been playing for over 40 years
as for build quality my h2 is like new after almost 18 months use
it has a terrific sound and its gorgeous
so i replaced with these
no further action is necessary
ive tried all 3 types of these and theyre pretty much asadvertised
so its kind of like double trouble
these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand
i also own the cut capo for other styles
pacific hardware is excellent right up there with tama
its virtues are many and varied
it is so accurate and works great so far
these pots are cts and have a nice tight feel compared to alpha pots
given to sister from mysel
as for this joyo i cant complain
the string are easy to play and sound great
it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical
kinda sucks that its not level out of the box so 4 stars
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
check out my soundcloud  soundcloudcomljaymusic
this was an easy choice for me
these cant support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily
i do not like them
hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks
it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough
the y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a stratocaster
i wish it had a bit more gain
if you have a very high end guitar this might not work
this is a substantial stable very solidly built stand
what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound
price very reasonable price for what they do
you can lock each strap button with one hand great product
the bullet style makes its easier to install
i have 4 classical guitars 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string
it just does it all and well
these look great and work perfectly
excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player
they will last and last and last and give you great sound
never got this shine in my guitar with any other product
this is great for adding pedals
dont force me to buy an accessory just to power it up
it simply does its job and does it very well
i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume
it is cost effective and looks good
id owned a phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one
a workaround for the main issue follows the review
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
im more than happy with it but just dont know what else to add
why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac
no noise from this cable
little did i realize how good this one really is
any guitar is better than no guitar
easy to put together and holds my guitar very well
i was warned about the shielding but i havent experienced an issues yet
it also helped my boyfriend decide also
and was actually pleasantly surprised that the snark sn2 had a mic
hope they work when they do finally arrive
sturdy mic clip on a budget
the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones
olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls
dont think ill fool anyone but what the heck
these strings are just prefect and feel awesome
we always have to go and retune it which can be frustrating
you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings
as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired
granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist
about half the size of a regular pick
easy to work with and also easy to find
restrung my guitar with no problems
works great with my baritone ukulele
they are comparible in tone to dean markelys and slinkys imho
i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all
very good item if you are a musician you need it
you cannot find a better guitar for this price
i loaded them up anyway
it looks really good almost like an ornament
all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price
she has the korg tm40 metronome
thats to be expected in a passive di box and it doesnt bother me
it now sits on my amp collecting dust
i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot
secondly its fender reliable with a 5 year warranty
then i saw this one
there is no need to dl the fbv software for this
just found out the best part of this amp
when i used that adapter it seemed to work just fine
i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product
this guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather
this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box
this is indeed a 6string ukulele
intermittent issue indication  this is what made me choose this model
the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return
i doubt there is that much difference
the last string winder you will ever buy
you get what you pay for
i sold it after using it for about a year or so
definitely a great value for the money
it rejects whats behind and to the side but in front its pretty sensitive
got what i paid for
i am pleased with this product
very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out
good product for practice or recording
hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point
no triangle or civil war
not that many good productsaccessories for ukuleles
my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings
i wet it before attaching
this stands up and holds the microphone in place
they sure are portable though
when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly
i own a red blue and now a black one
this is not worth the money
id buy the neotech simple sling again
much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws
perhaps i got the wrong thing
overall extremely happy with this purchase
its cheap and it works as advertised
this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now
but the dunlop is better to me
no frills just a simple concept that works
the unit is extremely small but dont let that fool you
not cheap or poorly made at all a great value
love the tone i can obtain too
if you dont have a ts type pedal this is a good cheap choice
sorry i dont like these as theyre just too big
for the money you cant go wrong with this effect
theyre not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience
i like the sound they provide and the price is nice
everything just works great first time
guitar bag fit over my fender t bucket guitar
the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch
the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic
gls continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price
no worries about using this with an expensive instrument
plenty of compartments for all of your accessories
works right out of the box
this is a good quality capo
very solid and i feel comfortable hanging my taylor 414ce in this
i have always had trouble holding onto picks
i got these for a partstele i built and im really happy with them
it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for
the adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever it does its job well
i guess out of sight out of mind
every one in my band uses this tuner
dont hope to take chords on it
maybe you want a 34lofi34 sound
i feel it sounds really good and has many settings
that said for the price it is an excellent product
however that was before a firmware update
this a very clever idea
the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but i prefer the acoustic sound
i get about a month of playing from those strings
a few more inches would have been appreciated
i love this boost pedal so much
these seem very well made
it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc
i bought this amp to replace a squier sp10 that came with my guitar
plus its on sale right now so snatch one before theyre all gone
the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed
the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely
try it out for yourself
warranty runs for a year
these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut
sure you can spend more on a slide but i see no reason to
and i say duh huh really
shipping was fast and id definitely recommend these
i just cant think of a single complaint
just get it try it and see if you like it jeez
the next thing to do is to block the tremolo whammy mechanism
these strings really do feel and sound great
and no i dont work for daddario just a longtime fan
so i do carry and use these occasionally but they arent my everyday pick
the musicians gear stand does everything i needed it to
both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for
which is good if you are as clumsy as i am
these white nylon picks should last a lot longer
it is basic and not fancy
you may have experienced the problems of musicians
i am always very careful when turning the 34head34
i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix
it arrived today and i decided to give it a quick workout
finally a product that is as simple to use as a pointandshoot camera
i ordered both this one and the lee oskar
great product and extremely affordable
this is the first one ive bought that had the smaller transducers
the behringer cs400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor
its a guitar strap it does the job and looks good
the 300  350 are cheap and they work
especially noticeable in the lower registers
smooth tone the right amount of gain perfect to push a tube amp
for those looking for insane crunch this isnt for you
just put a good analog fuzz after it  youre good to go
it just does the job and im more than satisfied
love their xlr microphone cables too
the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly
before supply and demand kicks in
you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects
the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone
in case one wasnt good enough they double it up
its cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp
might work well for recording too when you take the output jack
once you get used to the small size there is no going back
oh and the casing isnt like a wimpy plastic knife plastic
good materialdecent paddingnice front pocketzippers function without issue
has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo
i was so wrong in giving it only 2 stars
all in all this is a great guitar for a great price
still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit
i have installed a set i got 8 and it sounds really good
you can also stack the cm2 with other pedals
i recommend trying it and saving some cash
truly a unique and versatile creation
since then ive used nothing else
i bought it mainly to use with my nonpedal steel guitar
but locking tuners are not really for that purpose
sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble
im very pleased with it and recommend it
i like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out
it doesnt scratch the guitar and works great
buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones
but for this price why bother
the finish is much darker then the pictures online show
at first i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss
it is like an added bonus
other than that its great
my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks
tiny and seems to be accurate
i have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds
i use them on all 4 of my guitars
then i stumbled on this cherub pickup
any lower and it is a steal
each of the models are distinct
i mean very loud radio background and i couldnt get ride of it
the autoclose function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger
they are a fantastic mic great quality and construction
so you can wind and unwind
i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good
they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights
once in sound hole pickup did not work at all
i will review that later
thats about the only pro
cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far
these little tuners are amazing
it is what i expected it to be
i ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great
i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings
this is a no brainer
recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges
it is made of aluminum not abs plastic as another reviewer suggested
i plug in my even tide timefactor and works great by itself
i like medium picks and this feels comfortable
one of the best tuners out there
of course a guitar cable is a required extra
im very pleased with it
keeping in mind im a guitar player who just bought a drum kit
i had the boss looper with 2 pedals and it was noisy on playback
mounted and this looks like a solid product
this little amp kicks major ass dood
with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect
the flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal
i currently own 60 or so guitars
these mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response
this mic stand is a great value
ill update how i hook it up
on tv theyre sold for 80
this product meets all my expectations
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand
more profit in someones pocket for marketing jargon
the joyo is an exact clone of the tech 21british pedal which costs 189
just go for the gusto and find what you like
if theirs better ones out there then i cant wait to get one
its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use
fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners
it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge
ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo
this is more of a user problem than manufacturing
this problem is gone with the new preamp
you can stop from overdub but not start the loop
this is great but i needed an actual soundhole cover
these are nice and sturdy picks
i like hard picks and these were the ones i needed
they couldve make it a little bigger
best looper for the money
it is lined and has a pouch for song books
i always recommend all kyser capos
its very heavy and seems sturdy and well built
the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies
then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck
went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand
these are miracle strings in my mind
can be done but not as good
i choose this rating cause it is the best adapter ive found
anyway it doesnt seem much more then a normal gig bag
works great with my new mixer
its better in every way than the ny reissue
that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp
they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful
thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia
very happy with this product and the price is incredible
im running windows 7 64bit and everything installed flawlessly
the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable
you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal
almost compares to a monster cable
this holder grips the ipad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue
it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound
i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications
i wrote a least three times and got no response so far
use them on all makes and no complaints todate
let me start of by saying this tuner is great
this snark will tune about anything
im happy with this purchase
it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe
lolyou will need a 1532nd drill bit to complete the install
but its a very good strap
i play guitar and stand behind the vocalists
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes
i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic
you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz
it works and is my second favorite
i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too
i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend
you get what you pay for
it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too
when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked
first off id like to address any construction concerns
ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully
before i play i run the cleaner over the strings a few times
i have never broke a daddario acoustic string
right now its a mere 45
with live play this could hold its own and in the sweet spot
i will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal board
its a great pedal period
i like that one a little bit better
had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong
the velcro seems to be of decent quality too
i had used some boss ce5 and ch1 and substituted them with this unit
these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well
then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better
has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound
i am using this on my martin 12string
just ups the value even further
but once you got it its a fine product
the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for
i really like the soft flexible cable these have
the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes
i have a few planet waves products and i can safely recommend them
i have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar
it is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely
i will replace with 12s however
whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel
and i can even hold onto it
this item has sewnseamed edges that will not fray
im truly surprised by all the good reviews here
they also depend on the built in adda converters in the ipadios device
one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these
these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again
it saves you so much money
the pedal cuts through and is articulate
this just doesnt work for me in the studio
this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software
it costs a buck thirty
however when i set the guitar down for a moment i started hearing voices
hey i got this and an ovation idea from godps
youll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches
i use this light for music sheets documents and books
its built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely
another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor
this is my first strobe tuner
these are the best ones ive tried so far
i am also looking at the zoom h1 which will come out in sept
great for gigging remote events
i will tell you my wah pedal story
it was a hassle but i got it done nicely
at least i know that they fit snug
th only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere
just a few words squier by fender
they sound good they are light weight
this item does not work and is a total waste of money
using cheaply made cables could affect your sound  you can loose top end
lee oskar harps are the best value
i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand
so first of all i want to say packaging is great
these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick
i put this on my mandolin
the holes work with my strap buttons okay
i play fingerstyle and they feel great
i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc
i needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic
some people rate this above the snark devices but i cannot
you get 30 days to register it
frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing
thats all i want from replacment parts
solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp
they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though
it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well
after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured
i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc
but even so theres really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low
u wont be happy either
so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not
there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar
fine for a few weeks now
i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage
little bit modify at the bridge will make great guitar
especially if you use tubes
i have never understood why yamaha keyboards dont come with a power supply
flexible good tone good quality
any smaller and it would be going in the trash
adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive
but a real assorted pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors
i found that out quickly
it takes up a very negligible amount of space
have not used the strings yet i bought them as back up
like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined
saw these and tried again
i really wanted sure sm588217s but the budget did not allow it
im not going to recommend this over the 15 capos
the provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming
the directions are in the package
loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of naturalsounding distorted tones
so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed
i bought these for my new strat
these blue steel light strings sound like gold
my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this
for the money this thing sounds just fine
additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar
if youre just starting out this guitar is perfect for you
but since i solved that problem with the honing stone i was more curious
a good solid piece of equipment
i cant really explain why they just feel right
the cables are flexible quiet and no pops or loss of signal
this is a very good quality nice sounding delay
it works very well on a pedalboard
the yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as youd expect for this price
the cords arent very long
keeps my case at a nice 6070 humidity
this is an attractive leather head stock strap
it looks very professional and works without any problems
ive been playing for 29 years and i highly recommend joyo pedals
its an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
one could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals
these feel a bit weak
i plan on buying these for all my guitars
this is my first tuner and its great already
this product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me
you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic
treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot
the sc1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars
i would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose
i own several small tuners including the enote nano tuner and the snark
34 yes you might think so until you plug it in
ill definitely be buying more of these
bought this strap for use with my dean evo electric
i occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls
it doesnt get much action my amp has a reverb
you need this to get the most out of your superchamp xd amp
this tuner is easy to use
there are other solutions to this dilemma
just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts
big bold bottom end with some singing highs
based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these
so now it comes down to the shubb 1 deluxe and the planet waves
as soon as you press down its on
i dont think you will be dissappointed
this is my second black suede leather strap ive bought from levys
solid tuner more accurate than i anticipated and very easy to use
it holds my jazz bass without any problem
today same thing and its obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp
you can also reassign the presets to different effects
this is a great cable at a good price
its pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig
i havent had a problem with this
just wish it was more like a fender pic finish
dont expect the fab series to be good at everything
the hardware is decent but i wouldnt expect the hinges to last forever
i see why you pay more
i know theyre more expensive but youll be happier off in the long run
these are the classiest nicest looking picks i own
the screen is super faint
ive purchased many of these cables and ill be getting more eventually
i use this for a microphone and it seems to be solidlybuilt
isnt that asking a bit much
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design
they are good for strumming
this is my favorite od pedal that i have
you have to take the pedal off to access the battery
it was just a light reverb i get
so not much selection there
even if youre starting out you should tell the difference right away
it works for guitar and bass
these are good picks and produce a great tone
it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment
i cant believe these were actually sent to me
so far im very happy with this microphone
nice and stable  no issues  works perfectly
so you cant use this as a clean boost pedal
ive been using daddario xl strings since the 80s
my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case
it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle
lighter than a full boom
i will probably get another
i didnt like it cause of the squealing
he found exactly what his guitar needed and at a good price
cant go wrong with this one
i used to have trouble holding on to picks
i absolutely love these picks
they sound great and hold their tone for a long time
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived
the instrument overall is fairly easy to play especially in the lower positions
ill probably be buried with one in my hand
there are a few more different models and brands that are good
youll end up saving money over the long haul
however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone
this is a must have just buy it
really what more can you say
at its price point  5 stars
so far ive had no problems
i feel like i was neglecting my guitars until i got this
tension wise at d standard 1156 is ideal but 1152 is doable
the angle does the job
bracing is light  the entire guitar is light
they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand
a good purchase for a low priced capo
love the sound and playability and durability
groove tubes were the tubes to have in the late 80s
it is sensitive and accurate
i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week
the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out
i do not regret this purchase at all
i was skeptical about this 34impossible to drop34 thing which i read
i would recommend this to anyone
not really a big concern though
this cloth doesnt slide around and thats a good thing
i write and record my own music
despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use it
great price for a carbon copy pedal
i like the brit setting
it a kyser quick change capo
there are better options out there for something portable
not the fullest tone but you wouldnt expect that with extra light strings
technically this at108 is at the low end of the famous behringer line
minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar
i was going to buy the boss rv5 when i somehow discovered biyang
like noticable and just horrible
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
the korgstyle dialin reverb controls are easy but extremely limited
which can dramatically shape the overall sound
then i thought this thing cant work very well but it does perfectly
sturdy enough well priced and simple to use
it feels little bit stiffer than regular
make sure you dont buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead
i use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars
pair this up with a pedaltrain board and youve got yourself a sweet setup
it definitely stands up to their reputation
very easy and simple to use
i sent it back without hesitation
as others have noted the finish can vary drastically
something clipon would have been more useful
the price is so low you should own at least one
overall pretty good and very simple to operate
just that there are better choices in my opinion
dont let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you
everything i wanted and more
this is a professional wireless system
i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated
treat it gently and it will last forever
i own several gig bags and this is my favorite
the strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
im using it with an lr baggs m1a active soundhole pickup
i got this for our church
any size wuhan china sounds great
a good quality cable at a very good price
sounds good with both guitars  especially neck and center positions
its simple  easy to use
very good sound and quality
the best i8217ve used so far
for the money you cant beat it
made in the usa was a great thing to see
also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides
the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent
slips right out of every pedal i have
its your guitar on steriods
i have an fcb10 that i use and like great controller for the price
this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage
a welldesigned strap that looks and works really nice
never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker
they are good quality and very durable
this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp
at 2000 this amp is a deal
all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it
but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings
theyre noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummylike
cranked out a nice distortion for my fender guitar
this is exactly what i wanted
i am now thinking about trying this on my martin
but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all
good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar
the design is solid well made and will go the distance
guitar is my primary instrument and i am a decent singer but not great
but very nice balance as i said
good product for a inexpensive foot pedal
for such a low price you cant go wrong
for me the added benefit just isnt worth the effort
believe it or not ive yet to use this screen
i agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup
it has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele
its those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china
i have issued the refund of 704
no effects loop means that your timebased effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy
i love these cheap little pedals
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar
i have a marshall mg15cfx solid state amp
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
it has a durable feel to it
i really liked this one
sure i can still use a regular pick when thats all thats available
but these are great for about any electric
average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner
this product lives up to its calling
on average it eats a battery a day
i store them in a little sandwich bag
its small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk
these really do work great
this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging
he would not send a warranty replacement
sidenote  the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me
this is one of the nicer capos ive used
to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior
i also perform live in a cover band
just not what i needed in my particular situation
this guy filled the need
so by all means buy these on price but when you get your items
i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy
i did this for two days in a row
i cant honestly say its a toy but it reeks beginner instrument
now after a couple of months i want to say
they sound clear and bright and they last a good while
im glad i replaced it
all in all these arent bad
onehand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner
i have used daddario for a number of years
the capo is made of metal and works well
best straplocks i have ever had
bought these for home karaoke and they work great
soft callouses  no callouses
the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected
not the easiest battery access ive ever seen
my capo could not even hold them
as far as cq goes these are great no problems feel great sound great
i bought this because it was cheap and figured it cant be that bad
no need to even use my pod pro
other than that the strings are just a little squeaky
unlike a nice 20 pound amp the chord wont pull out
you can even work it into your live performances
its a mainstay on my pedal board now
always the best string i buy
i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp
i love em use them daily and rely on them
first the good   this instrument is a good beginner piece
and i dont even like digital
you have to get this cap on just right or the strings will buzz
the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke
its considerably heaver than than i thought
no need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters
for the price it cant really be beat
it has led lights to follow as well as a meter to use
these are my favorite picks to play with
i use it on my seagull and it totally works great
this amp out does my old roland cube 60
this pedal has flawless colorless sound quality
the base of this bone nut does not have a radius
the pedal itself works perfectly fine
it will sound a lot better and its not too much more expensive
it is pack very well and i use it everyday
it does do what is supposed to do
a great purchase and built like a tank
this is a must for black guitars
this is a great mic
it feels very sturdy and im not worried about it cracking anytime soon
these are three times as high at guitar center
i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrivedistortion
these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others
i probably have around twelve of them
you cant have too many adapters if you are a sound guy
i only use about 7580 percent
i have more expensive cables but rather use these
this is a musthave item for drummers and the wellorganized
its just the right length for sitting on the couch strumming daily
well made xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini
so far very reliable after a few months of use
worth the small price you pay
that couldnt be further from the truth
i think it sounds fine
i have that one too
it may be a challenge to assemble it
heres an entertaining howto video that will walk you through it
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk
they are a great idea
the smell of this guitar is also amazing
the sound quality complaints are no joke
it reacts quickly and is not oversensitive
weve used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity
its a fun strum and well worth the 20
its a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny
clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there
pros its small and lightweight
its nothing of the sort nor should it be
i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar
these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele
they are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap
it also is a nice smooth od not too crunchy
the simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat
perfect fit for medium picks
i really like this delay
i ended up using a daddario string of the same gauge in its place
all are fast and accurate
good lows and clean highs without any hiss
i finally ended up getting the tascam dr07 which i am very happy with
finish your serch and buy this one
if anything this pedal is as good as new
if you are disappointed and want something better expect to pay at least double
these are a bit short only complaint
its easier to strap up because of the quick release tab
when the unit first arrived i was concerned because the box had been damaged
it works for what i use it for
everything about the pedal is rugged and durable
i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs
this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range
this one was a good buy for the money
adjusting the height and tilt is difficult
these are what they need to be
rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive
i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts
i was impressed with the sound
these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch
the cutter makes this thing really worth while
its super cheap and i dont mean the price
i believe it has accomplished that well
the case is also very well balanced with the guitar inside
unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq
if you like this guage youd like these
minus one star for a little price gouging
been using these for years
played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now
for years ive owned a nice at4033
once again the controls are easy and direct
this does the job but its fairly thin and not all that well padded
i love these string swings
they have a nice stage presence
there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case
they had a rough feel and were stiff
this is what i have been looking for for my accoustic guitar
just finished setting it up
the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything
this strap is strong and sturdy
i wont waste money on the more expensive cables again
outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget
i always lose my damn picks this helps
i have a pretty crappy ear so i rely on it to tune correctly
the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips
im very satisfied with the performance of the cm2
i have been playing guitar for over 30 years
i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space
certainly if he did he never patented it or anything
these string play good and stay in tune pretty well
i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board
twang to slayer in a flip of a preset
45 db isnt much at all for any decent mic preamp
the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need
but after 1 song you have to tune it again
not the end of the world but i just dont understand why
the grips come off the neck on my acousticbut works better on my electric
but as far as run around and taking lessons
can double as a mic or boom stand
most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries
from patch cables to guitar cables i simply trust this company
ultimately my search was narrowed down to this spider and a fender mustang
cant b beat for the cost
you get what you pay for
besides that i am totally stoked and happy with these
it has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well
ive read that folks prefer the kk over the madeforthegsminitaylorpickup
it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need
i bought my first pack over 7 years ago and ive been hooked
youre probably also buying your strings by the box
it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce
so far it still works well
with the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here
for at home but i really wouldnt recomend them for gigging too much
stop waiting and grab one you cant go wrong
he is thrilled with this guitar
i works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables
i use all types and all brands and fenders are always predictably great quality
high value for low  risk
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more
i may tease and say its and award or art piece
it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured
it may tend to overdrive a little bit
go ahead and get this thing
and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing
it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price
i havent had to change mine in almost two years since ive had it
it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments
the handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles
so now i get brighter colored ones
the jam man solo is an amazing pedal
i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic
but even its ability to take some distortion is pretty good
i will experiment with different instruments  write more about the quality later
its not rough on my neck and is very adjustable
i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast
works well since i got it
so in that regard i prefer planet waves cables
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine
can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall
my other review was not fair
this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost
these strings seem to last longer than the others ive used
exactly as described in the ad
i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices
the picks are great and i couldnt be happier with the order
they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain
i will never use strap locks again after trying these
the strings are with out a doubt real fender strings
i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound
i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges
it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly
its a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well
this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected
way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic
its a boss its solid  and a great price
the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps
i am happy i bought this
the top part is not secured
these are my favorite guitar strings
i lost one already so now i have 9
it just might not be your sound
these cables seem to be qualitymade
replace it with another broke a product
there are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators metronomes etc
grade a cable at a very affordable price
packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use
they bend but not easily
a must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables
14 phone f  stereo 14 phone m
but this seiko is certainly the quickest
the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part
i read in a review that these hold six picks
i use a keeley in my live shows
the extralong 1300 millisecond delay is great for pink floyddavid gilmour style solos
i dont like the direction the dunlop faces it seems awkward
the m5 is serving that purpose
they cost a little more than this
just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal
i really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs
a dull inept version of a tubescreamer
keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board
so again another reason for the 5th star
easy to grip and as durable as most
ultraportable by using a 9v battery instead of the ac adaptor
i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it
the coversion cable didnt work
simple to use works well on the squier strat
think acdc and van halen to metallica
erm it does what it say it would do
the one i got kept cutting in and out
the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also
attaches to my audio interface
its much easier to play than the squier and it has a better sound
full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound
id recommend these to someone trying to save some money
one for bass rolloff and one for midrange emphasis  presence boost
the line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier
for kicks try it out with some distortion andor overdrive and a wah
its performance look and feel are great
bottom line is elixirs sound great play well and least a really long time
in fact its the worst contaminant ever
this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals
i am glad i didnt break budget here
this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up
mr miyagi couldnt have said it any better
if these dont work for you you can always buy the vpick
maybe its better under mac
does not work for all guitars
this product works for me and the quality is pretty good
if you havent used these picks get some
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them
still id rather stick with a copper slide
some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdmausbinf
chances are its in working order no matter what
gave them a good stretch and theyre holding pitch well
they help nail his tone and are slick light feel and handle bends perfectly
what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect
this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies
great tool and has two different modes which is cool
for 2000 it is worth all day
great price and well made
i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks
that was a disappointment for another reviewer for me its a plus
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster
its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these
i felt as if the uke was well worth the low price
press a third time to dub on top of your last layer
the bass is tight and articulate which is what you want
the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality
this thing is incredibly cool
ive been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970s
balanced signal is so much better
they blend together beautifully when paying chords
just a little larger than a zippo lighter
i feel that its a good deal and  recommend it
other than that the strap is of good quality
it does its job pretty good but it does color your tone some what
i have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless
go sell your snake oil to someone else
they sound just as good as they did a year ago
tried these on a whim
overall a very useable metronome
this product puts my older laptop besides newer ones
not really concerned about that but its worth mentioning
one less power supply to hook up
i would recommend these to anyone
great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price
it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat
it curls around my microphone stand well too
i find myself using it a lot
juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh
job only took about 15 minutes
otherwise id highly recommend a more expensive model
pretty darn good in every way
this is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling
i dont know if its going to last me a while
not too big and gets the job done
they are perfect for rhythm flexible
i like this one the best
a bargain at the offered price
the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver
i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems
this cord is too flimsy
however with this price i wouldnt complain at all
excellent multieffect great sounds the distortions are really great
all in all 7 very well spent
another item never received but i would not use anything over
these are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured
it fits my mxl mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem
the photo makes them look weaker than they are
it connected well in the nady smpsx1 phantom power unit i bought
heavy if thats what your looking for
wish i discovered these years ago
the sound is pretty great
i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii
you can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually
the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not
for me that does not justify it
point two  any form of gain will create a ton of hiss
works on everything i own which is 3 acoustics and 1 gretsch hollow body
does it sound exactly like a 57
just what id expect from the company
i had to sand it down some in all directions
i got them fast and saved twenty bucks
the overall quality seems good and i have had no problems
im still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood
but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation
i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks
its just more accessible on the desk
its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly
no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping
the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board
thats why i got this
used this foot pedal for a and so far ive had know problems
if sound quality is your primary concern well
i say they sound great and are worth trying
i warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and yes
nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough
i purchased this for my sons acoustic guitar
since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand
i would expect that from an asian knockoff not from an alist gear maker
have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar
it is a nice smaller version of the 114si road pro
these are better and screw in
25 whereas the same string in the exl111 set is
three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step
they have great sustain and sound nice and chunky
much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem
a small but effective little amp
not to bulky and the right angle plugs save space
finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it
i prefer a standard pick for that
but wow at this price how can one gripe
quick to set up  tear down  adjust
these things are so great
that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks
very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass
i leave it on my guitar all the time
i am done thinking a good pedal must cost 200 and above
i know its a copy of other speakeramps
driven full distortion it adds sustain
overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavyduty
it works well for my home recording
forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal
the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars
this is an amazing pedal
sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss pedal
these are one of the best strings ive used
used on my acoustic guitar
this was one of two i purchased
the elixir 8020 comes out on top
you see i purchased an open box speaker
ive always liked the parametric eq on this pedal
they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them
this is a super bag
btw thats all i have to say so dont make me type more
well built and good adjustability
the strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots
giving these 3 stars is being generous
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
incidentally this pedal like any other digital delay or digital reverb will eat batteries
if you cant afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul
i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone
low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11 00
what more could you want
one bottle should last you a very long time
it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right
it holds incredible its not coming out now for sure
quite pleased with this little mixerpreamp
it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties
this seemed like the best option for that
once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now
update 2011jul31  the strap is still rather stiff
you use a average weight mic or4
this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous
it holds a mic just fine
i suppose it is the best choise for your kid
it works as a beginner tool but only that
it came to me right on time with no problems at all
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga
think of this as an artists tool
time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions
great seller and fast delivery
had i gone with a more expensive model id feel locked in
its close enough for my needs
great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks
first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying
im completely satisfied with this
i believe it was x
it was a pain to take out too
good for table top cajon hole by floor or recording
ordered these guitar picks for my son
anyway ive been playing guitar for about 15 years
go with it and get a set of these
its simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality
theyre my favorite picks and i always buy the medium ones
its possible i have a defective one not sure
i have used both and i am satisfied with both
easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments
i actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus
so perhaps i dont know what shade burgandy really is
it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings
its a bluegrey color and i didnt realize that
runs on 2 aa batteries
i have other harmonicas but thought id like a set of blues harps
order extra to keep on hand
price is right for entry level
im using it karaoke online in paltalk
the best sound i got was on my strat
and look like i make very good choice
but when i am winding new strings it often slips off
i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up
with accessories tonal quality is typically important
is a high quality instrument cable but low cost wont break the bank
easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path
i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage
it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue
however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise
which if you dont have you need it
ieutf8psc1 planet waves patch cables theyre listed at
great device and good price
the stand with my guitars looks awesome
i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these
im not sure what i was expecting
i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be
holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise
they still tune but i have to hold them against the guitar
it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening
do they sound as good as a 5k gibson f5
use for small music gigs and djmc uses
as usual an excellent zoom product
not a finger print on it anywhere
definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks
and really any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes
as rotosounds and theyre only a jackson not a bad string
probably not but so what
but id expected more robust on your structure
i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back
the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish
quick to clip on and off
i also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument
i found this pick very responsive flying through the scales on my les paul
very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar
this one is more confortable and has great grip
it simply works well for the price paid
no problems with it at all
im not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra
not so much on a flat fretboard classical
facts is facts thats all
effective and built like a tank
it uses stock os drivers that loaded right up
overall a good value for the low cost of this unit
my only complaint is that it could be smaller
my current one i bought in july and so far everything is holding up
will need to check them next week or so
the set screw fell out and could not be found
it is very snug on the strings
but its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them
i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house
this will be more than fine
its a great intro model not just for ipads
great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while
perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and depiezo the tone
a booster makes your signal louder
in all honesty buy a nicer filter or none at all
i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats
good price too nothing to complain about
the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours
small yet sturdy enough to hold a fullsize guitar
once hooked up i was very surprised how flimsy it is
ive paid a lot more for a lot less
it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box
im quite happy with it
i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin
the pickup adds a bright clear sound to your instrument without feedback or hassle
for my desired application this guitar was great
the reason i bought this one was because it was cheap
but most on these things leak anyway
less than one star for this piece of
if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles
this is an always on pedal for me
you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings
i have used that other sbrand on other instruments and really prefer the dunlops
as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved
i like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease
curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate
great guitar companies dont always make or sell under their aegis the best strings
i got it for my son and he wasnt impressed
an all around tough mic
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use
this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage
they sound much better and arent quite as loud
move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune
not a big knock actually
plus they feel and sound good
i could not be happier
everything is so quiet with no hum
the tone is a touch wooden it doesnt sing as the old taka did
it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup
great connection sounds good and no issues at all
yeah go look that up
the only solid white leather strap i could find that didnt have any ornamentation
sounds great easy to adjust
for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok
this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards
wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free
i have to admit that this is true
seems like theyll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us
hey now youre eric clapton
i have an abundance of strat parts
the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze
it acts like a vice in a woodshop project
there really is nothing not to like about this pedal
i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless
do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin
darrario does sell some fine strings
these are well made and dont strip when screwing in for the first time
these are easy to install and simple to use
a simple delay looper will suffice
i use it for external audio recording for dslr video
the time it saves is also invaluable
flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster
dab fast fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced
bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law
yea it was coming from vegas to ny but 10 days
this stand is ok for light home use
that plus the dryupclose characteristic are this mics top selling points
they must have standard fittings on mikes
good locks i like them better then the dunlops
a great deal for a nominal amount of money
it gives just the right amount of crunch when needed
first of all i am a beginner
this was exactly what i needed
but thats an 80 custom shop pedal from mxr
even a professional would appreciate this capo
the strings are some kind of cheap nylon
if its still built like my case never can tell these days
very stable easy to assemble  and a nice price
it likely works fine for a guitar though
fits either a tele or strat
i have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years
so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue
trim and easy to use
simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors
they are very sensitive so i feel that my instrument is in truer tune
the display pivots to any angle
the display is good and the tuners work well
my only small 34concern34 is the length of the arm itself
no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind
very handy for making it all just right
i liked these a lot
so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early
so now that i have it i can finally record to my laptop
i ended up switching to a vintagetube overdrive by behringer
unhappy with it actually i already replaced them
for an inexpensive unit this thing rules
it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them
garbage if you like it
i have an epiphone dot and i installed a bigsby v5 on it
for a regular venue i have an extra marshall 500watt speaker system
hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone
unfortunately it doesnt fit on top of our harp
i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti
i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail
it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning
im not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself
though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby
here are their key points  good quality construction
great price i own many of these
oh well i went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead
in my experience of course ymmv
this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow
but what is the point if it is so much inferior
cant reccomend it enough especially considering the price
these big stubby picks have solved that problem
it sounds great clean or dirty
im rapidly becoming a behringer fan
it fit perfect on my new hercules mic stand and was ready to go
the guitar sings beautifully the tone is rich and vibrant
it would be hard to beat
a sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too
no more unpluggingplugging inbetween songs
it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound
been using these for years
it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop
for 13 its hard to say anything bad about this gadget
i figure it tells wouldbe thieves what theyre getting
and then there are the micros
i am in afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by
the gateshop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review
i know this is a great product
it does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant to
however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet
line in  usb buttons somewhat confusing nonintuitive
it is easy to use
this works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three
excellent product at a righteous price
i enjoy this product and i definitely use them on my acoustic
the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust
there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations
im amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs
with stretching they stay in tune fine
in that environment i thought it a nice instrument
mxl really should reconsider its association with reaper
im seriously impressed with the quality
so for that many kind of modes barely useful
thats what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses
im pretty crafty and really like this
provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars
summarygreat pedal buy it youll probably keep it
yeah i know touch screens are cool
really brings out the beauty of true wood
i dont want anything else
im glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them
the snake took its place
what is there to say
summaryif you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time when you restring
however at amazons current value price for this particular monster cable its a nobrainer
it sounds like its behringer
this amp is perfect for that
they all need one more joint to adjust the angle
the extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability
a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar
weve been only using it for two days and so far so good
does not have an onoff switch which is a bit disappointing
but since my room isnt perfect this will do
but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio
these mikes sound almost identical the b 2000 and the shure sm
but as a platform for greatsounding mods you cant go wrong
give it high marks for form and function
it doesnt obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner
please refer to my review of cakewalk music creator 6 here on amazoncom
distortion is incredibly subjectiveit depends on your rig and your tastes
have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time
it is my tuner of choice right now
this was a good choice
not so with this pedal
this has come in handy many times in my studio z108net
i really like all of them
i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise
both have excellent sound quality
covers all strings and depresses them fully
i have no hissing and no problems
it also seem tightly put together at the ends
this guitar pays better than some 3 times is value
realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar
i dont have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand
this may be a big issue if you dont treat your equipment carefully
very beatiful and good quality
i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this
would like different holiday designs like this
i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life
this pedal does exactly what it says its supposed to
and expect to get it the price was half of what i was locally
i always end up using a little fender portable stand
i would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well
simply outstanding simply the best
a good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control
ive 34first act34 brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed
holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation
strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel
i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board
medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people
currently theyre 1199 on here compared to 499 or less for the regular version
but unless you are new to guitar you know that
plus the tweed look really grows on you
i use to tune with an antique korg
they sound good and are affordable
solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly
there is a big drop in the freq
this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool
and i have spares for later or to share
you go through batteries like crazy and it doesnt work at all for bass
these have worked great when ive needed to have 14 input vs the xlr
it really has its own tone i must add
short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do
all and all a super practice amp or micable performance amp
it sounds good and looks really nice
they are correct but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle
i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldnt really tell that much
i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects
it does all of them well
i use it for both bass and guitar and it processes the signals well
color wasnt as advertised its more of an offwhite than a vintage cream
i fried a bbe delay the same way
long wait for overpriced item
my original review very easy to install didnt require drilling
arrived early and is of great quality
im a long time daddario user
tons of bang for your buck
no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords
the muff is a lot more noisy
id prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it dont
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly
other reviewers commented on accuracy
ill probably get another one
dont waste your time with this
sorry yamaha but facts is facts
doesnt cost 11000 dollars other
to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic
you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud
ah finally one of the real reviews
anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing
you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it
it works and it is relatively inexpensive
i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon
this also helps those of us using electric guitars that dont have extrawound humbuckers
it will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking
spend more if you can
the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell
ive tried a couple different heads and they all sound great
even so would nothesitate to use that way
almost all celtic music sounds great
extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this
they do work and theyre effective but they are too pronounced
fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate
i bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles i own
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
there are people who are comparing this to the shure sm57 and other microphones
soothing music is part of the fix
for that application it works fine and sounds great
however if youre just doing it as a hobbyside job
until then thisll be a fun toy to play with
it has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all
i mentioned that these are for inside playing
these mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room
i would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many
this seems like a good product
i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings
these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise
punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range
he said that you can hear the guitar but barely
sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string but generally works great
this pedal sort of let me down a bit
this mic works better for some people than others
think it sounds like a trash can lid
now i will be checking all of them for sure
theres just one button so its idiotproof
i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry
on the packaging i dont like what daddario has done
like all boss pedals its as sturdy as a little truck
013 which frankly i cant feel
it is portable so i always have it with me
the 34hall34 setting is phenomenal
from aint talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the 80s
had a few packs of these from christmas
let me start by saying
boutiqueesque is how i would characterize it
so because of the limitations i rate it as above
i change strings every two weeks
but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem
and the price was right
a very boring dull uninspiring pedal
works like it is suppose to good quality
my inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound
its quite a bit stronger of a microphone also
made from good materials and is attractive
and hes pretty picky about his guitar strings
ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars
after 2 weeks im still loving the guitar
the electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing
this is just what the doctor ordered
it changed the whole way i play now
great product for entry level and great price for what you get
the builtin effects are probably its weakest point
you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound
i feel like i should be paying more for these strings
play an ibanez acoustic electric
it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping
the pack brings 6 picks
this new fender straplocks make installing them on the strap easy
i use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary
great mic stand for the price
works as expected and should last a really really long time
what can i say it works
when they say small they mean small
this is a really nice strap
the inside is nicely lined the hardware is solid
seem good not legendary and tremelowhammy standard zinc block theres the must upgrade part
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
and yet the price is the best part of all
i bought this on a whim
the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic
it is solid but light weight enought to move as needed
the sn2 senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup
but it sounds great with singlecoils too
and is just the best and simplest design
do it have a decent quality sound
its about one and a half inches wide by the way
thanks samson now just make better mics
i have one of these and the amount of detail is great
they are great for holding picks  make wonderful gifts
i was really surprised to see how well they sounded
comfortable and very nice fabric
the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from
i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school
much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer
much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up
i have used it for several months with no problems
warning for beginners dont get this
it serves up great tones into either one
if you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine
the feel a little more stiff my usual
i had to be very careful to put it on squarely
it does not sound like an amplified pedal
i will not buy anther one
lush is the right word
i own a native instruments maschine mikro
i dont like the soft opening
for the price this is a good value
im a gadget lover and this is a good one
ive tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to
this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements
casual part time guitar player here
you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff
as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful
great case for small cash
this is the better choice for musicians
i am revising my previous review on the 3250ls
construction seems to be pretty good
great cord for the money
i still like my line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain
my daughters love this amp and works perfect
youll be able to hear them rattle
i have restored an old rex commander
for a cheap eq it does great
i wish i had more of a passion to play it but
however i believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine
i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements
the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk
i also really like the daddario pures
heck yes it sounds that good
overall  im very pleased with this pick
it does all that the advertisements say it will
of course i am just a beginner
thats not bad in itself
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning
the intelli imt500the tuner that killed the intellitouch
this design works best for me
small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction
this is stage one of my rebuild
very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows
my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job
almost hard to read tiny
i had a boss rc3 looperit involved too much bending over for me
i was using the bigger triangle kind before
good tone but dicey controls
besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me
but you will not hear a difference
dont drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime
i only wish id ordered the lights
i will stick with the schaller in all 3 colors
its a mic cable haha
took it on vacation so i didnt have to leave my axe at home
this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie
they will be none the wiser
no issues and pretty sure i will never have any
will work on any instrument
its not rocket science to make them work
i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time
these are 3999 each at a local music store so
fast forward a few years and ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals
its got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance
the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck
they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon
i dont trust it and amazon has it way over priced
i use this one spot adapter with the 5 pedal attachment
it would not seat properly and would slide out
the other has some kind of short in it
i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good
if you have any vision problems the display might be an issue
for the first 3 days the strings sound strange
shipped free as an add on item at the time
cant beat it for the price
its as good as it looks
it clips on easily and firmly
we tried to make the fendershallers work but just could not
liked this capo it worked fine
what else do you want it to do
in my experience these cables were not great
so much for magic elixir tone
in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight
work much better then the other style of string trees
great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers
my musician friends notice and wish they had one
i use the stand at home too
these are shred picks they are very accurate
currently the h2 is my backup unit
the string tension keeps it balanced in the front
i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp
maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up
way to thick for me
they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup
but the sound was horrible
it has a switch for zerolatency monitoring of whatever is coming in
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months
i bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an allinone guitaramplifieretc
i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about 2 years
the treble and bass control make huge sound differences
as a musician im in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner
i also ordered dava 6024 grip tip guitar picks they are nice
it fits my jasmine well
a toggle switch lets you choose between classic  modified setting
still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender 34f34 logo
try them youll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy
i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin
are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals
this may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventually
i ordered an 11hole pickguard and it fit like a glove
if you use an ac adapter get a hum eliminator
build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation
easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response
i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too
just check out my review video for the blue pop
it does not stick on to the guitar very well
its really cheap and the quality is good
these work great and look sweet too
not a huge deal if youre using a standard mic clip
its simple basic but i dont think it does that good of a job
a little stiff but im hoping it will loosen up with use
he has enjoy and likes using the capo
awesome value for the price
otherwise this is a nice strap
ive already posted about fast fret
it functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun
they sound great and are priced right
i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot
especially for the price this is a great buy
but i personally do not like how it looks of it when installed
they just rob your tone
they arent that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter
but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too
it is basically a toy
itll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing
it comes two in a package
10232012  still holding up well
overall its good enough to buy it
but the sound just lacked warmth
i dont need to use them myself
but i must say  so are these
i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound
it took quite a long time to get it right
the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
the work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple
i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp until now
five stars for being a better jazz iii
i love the fact that this controller has full size keys
this pedal is beyond loud
i have several capos  this one really surprised me for the price
that is why i chose black for mysecond set
subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound
and the overall look and feel is one of quality
i know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally
it has so many functions
it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional
i put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise
my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing
never used this seller or site for this purpose before
thank u joyo im your number 1 customer
pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument
for the price i paid cant beat what i got
so i uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software
very nice quality inexpensive guitar strap
these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully
the screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time
transparent in your signal chain when off as well
i would recommend others to try it
i will try the sn8 shortly and give this one to a friend
no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly
works like its supposed to
doesnt short out on you
the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel
theyre also not for those with smaller heads
and got burned for it
my item arrived lightning fast
the standard for mild nonoily instrument cleaners
thats been a few years ago
i like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases
the line 6 spider iv 75watt combo was the perfect solution
very happy with this purchase
that last one was far far better than the first two
thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk
the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero
the fact that it is passive really kills it
the look is not that inspiring but it protects your guitar
the tones are rich and warm
have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them
maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on it
arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger
it stays in tune and it high quality
this one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features
this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great
my neighbors im sure are not pleased
undaunted i ordered this musicians gear stand
it is a small design amplifier and does its job very well
when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy
first and foremost this amp is amazing
and im still waiting to hear back
what you see in the picture is what you get
string sound is a personal thing
wanted a way to plug in my boss me70 to save on batteries
works as advertised for my purpose
i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded
if its red youre off if its green youre in tune
play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick
buy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed
does a good job for a basic delay
so for linux users this may be a very attractive option
nice bright tone  and last a
they all differ somewhati fell in love with this one the most
this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight
all in all though very good for the price
but after purchasing i realized that a tool like this isnt too necessary
ive ordered 9 of these and only one has been defective
i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice
now the thing is worthless
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
since they swivel my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks
i dont know why people think this isnt sturdy
got a cleanerpolishwax type ointment for every part of your guitar
they were both amazed with the sound
have several tuners of different names and quality
works great right out of the box
i would recommend it to anyone
so it works well for that
also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want
well if you do you need strings
the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights
i have finally discovered that the 34perfect set34 is a moving target
i also have purchased several red blue and the new super tight tuner
the product is not meant to be used on maple
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
i  find the daddario strings will stay in better condition than others
you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows 7
bought them to replace the old 34vintage34 style knobs on my lp clone
to have a midi in and not be able to midi syncquantize the looper
the wahs were usable but just did not sound as good
my pet use to roam the car while driving
the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent
awesome little untreated polishing cloth
not a drop in replacment for many fenders
i dont really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described
bought a takamine 40 years ago
i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most
i have been online shopping banjos quite
great quality for the money and works well
mxr built like a tank
not a model of a champ amp the real deal
its very good quality like all planet waves products
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
i have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables
try it till you ready to by more expensive string
it offers rugged construction and true bypass
i used this capo on a gibson j40 hummingbird and a j200
keep em in every case
so far it has been wonderful for intonationinitial setups
they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning
stop reading this and order them
the only suggestion i would make is to have a different soundhole cover
very simple very userfriendlyand the feature that is most important i think versatile
but i havent dented anything yet so perhaps im just too skeptical
it does it really well with very little to no noise
shell find the small stuff in her stocking this christmas
my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one
im glad i bought it
it works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth
a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses
it just uses vibration of the instrument
go and buy the dunlop nylon
good   plenty of gain on hand
it is a great buy though considering the price
that being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway
just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something
i cant handle 12 strings and the sound of 10 is terrible
it fits exactly like an original fender hard case
its ok for the money and works good
i was lucky enough to get my hands on one early
performing nicely with a stock mim strat
i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way
there are a couple of annoying inconveniences
it wont make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony
in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings
i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest
but this little baby is now my second favorite
i take my trusty fender esquire
just what i was looking for
i am playing out of a peavey but i hear a tweed
well worth the price of the product
you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased
i tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it
the process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time
this capo is expensive but i have never found one that works so well
purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings
there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking
in closing spend the 40 buck and get this
it does exactly what is expected of it
it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks
however i may have added too much humidity
only negative check bc the ends are too bulky
the shoulder strap makes me feel important
about the effects on finish
it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon
it does work but the stuff i used to have was much better
i didnt even have to adjust it
gives a really broken sound
and with its length its plenty of room from your guitar to amp
this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric
right size well made and these do the job
does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music
but thats way too much amp for me at this time
swivel head for ease of viewing the screen
this holds guitars very well
is this guraunteed for life or something
installed easily in 3 different guitars so far
i see some people complaining about the strings
i use the dunlop tortex 114mm purples
i bought new strings but havent replaced them yet
these are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well
but you must be careful
he says they last a lot longer and sound better too
this bundleincluding an 8pedal chain a few adapters and the power supplydoes it all
for the price and intent i almost gave it 5 stars
i have them on all my guitars
there is nothing cheap or toylike about it
its a very fat sounding cab sim
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
if youve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean
this is a must have item in my opinion
this bag fits my epiphone les paul ii electric guitar very well
these work that well and are almost undetectable from the front
ill keep using them just maybe in a different gauge
this levys jacquard strap is well made and comfortable
lucky timing all black and fully assembled
the seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days
for some reason i thought theyd have different thicknesses from a previous review
the free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter
a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try
the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it
its fit very good to rack holes
this device works well but sound is far from perfect
ive had hohner racks before so i was prepared
moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward
just buy one now save yourself the trouble
i dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine
but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing
do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab
this is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three
if they d35 sounded dull id notice
having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly
i would recommend purchasing it
this is a great tuner
they sound great and last forever
still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter
its built like a tank and its nice and solid
but seriously that little paper wouldnt kill anybody
it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great
but always come back to this one
i wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar
the guitar has such a great ring to it
for the money you cannot beat these strings
what this tuner has  accuracy usability durability versatility
1100 i rate this a 98 gear head satisfaction
amazing clarity and worth the 28 and change
also some roomspashosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument
first off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable
bluray surround with the band was just amazing
i mean lets face it
a second problem with the mxr custom comp is noise
it comes with strings installed and almost tuned
plenty of sound effects to mess around with
im a man on the move and am constantly away from home
you have to get this pedal
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box
takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar
to be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different
there are better tuners out there
these the dunlop primetones felt picks metal picks etc
affordable accurate and they dont fall off your knee all the time lol
while some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele
and it really works well for home practice situations
its pretty easy to overpower the computers input and cause distortion
you really cant beat it for the price
that did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids
the plugin accessory is great and my pedal board has an outlet
have you heard good 70s recordings
battery is included also so you can use it right out the box
my wah wah a morley power wah was almost useless with it
it surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all
makes the fretboard feel like new but best to clean with alcohol wipes first
i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking
the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job
im also going to put on some elixir light strings
for high gain metal however i found that its a bit too hairy
like it was made from the same company but its not
tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially
this guitar is wonderful and sounds great
this pedal has three preamp settings  ts9 hot  and turbo
if you dont like it get a refund
the improvement in tone was immediate  this little guitar sounds pretty darn good
so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone
this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps
it can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory
you wont have difficulties to plug your pedals
nice added peace of mind
i was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size
i use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern
nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls
im not a guitar player so this uke is just a toyexperiment for me
soundwise i dont find that theyre significantly different from any other pick
there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too
almost all of the reviews i read were positive
other than that its perfect
one issue you may run into is the nut running loose
for the price and quality this kyser capo works on a uke
i was miserable my guitar sounded like s
perfect all the way around
this is a great little item
as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall
i order this for my glen burton cutaway
i recommend tightening the housing because everyone of mine were loose
its sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works
this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm
you can barely tell its there from the front
i researched a ton before i bought this one
for direct recording it does
right out of the box the hd 500 totally blew me away
the price was just right cam quickly and id buy them again
super fast shiiping  through amazon as always
the capsule is surrounded by this truncated conelike metal screen enclosed on all sides
just one more affordable improvement for the home studio
my newest amp the marshall jvm410 joe satriani replaced the reverb with noise gates
buttons and sliders and great for the price
i taught myself to play on this
took me a while to figure that last one out
what else can be said about aquila
i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips
so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model
i is accurate just doesnt respond to the string a fast
the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made
it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem
i use it now to get sort of a leslie effect
i received this yesterday in my order
it runs fine on batteries also
i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals
i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for 60 more
users of mxr carbon copy swear by them
if i bought eight adapters it would cost me well over 120 usd
i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it
normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long
they are certainly worth the price
works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass
the ds1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal
sounds great right out of the box and plays well
by far the most versatile pedal i have ever used
the display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever
not only that i like the idea that its an us company
the wider clip spreads the stress out
perfect for my beginner studio setup
but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses
very well made with good padding
this is handsdown the best tuner ive ever owned
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup
ive been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now
these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets
i used this with drums
never broke a string but i only play at home as a hobby
dont use a bigger bit
ive tried kyser capos and theyre good
in fact its beautiful and totally functional
nowafter i did this it is sweet
there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things
i wanted to like this
whatever the waveform is its not a sine wave not smooth at all
there are both xlr and trs inputs on the back
made of all metallooks and feels well made
its not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives
for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect
first time for a  soft wedgie
keeps wireless unit very snug and tight
these hold up well taking a good bend and beating
this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair
try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star
i feel the display is an improvement  easy on the eyes
behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it
great design easy to read works better than 2 other brand tuners i own
i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus
the other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built
ive read where people are using bottle caps instead of these
i feel chained to my workstation
thankfully it was just these cables
it is small and incredibly light weight you almost cant tell that its there
i dont use it for any heavy use
received promptly and tested out with acousticelectric guitar
you cant beat this for the price
they need to improve their quality control
but i see that most are the same
not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic
but i wanted more of a standup doghouse bass sound like early basses had
itd been about 6 years since ive had an electric guitar
best to have a noise gate handy
the head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config
cant really beat it for the price
i tried every brand until i got to these
they were direct drop ins
it came extremely well packed
very high quality microphone stand
having to look at the beating heart while you play is very difficult
does what it is designed to do it holds about 6 picks
yes its made of plastic but you cant expect any more for 25
it is well built and sturdy
zt should not have sold this for 450 in the first place
a plastic bag does fine
i dont think this can be beat
it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned
yes because i usually have spares
well made and the perfect length for my needs
you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out
i found one of these used for half the retail price
its a great deal if youre willing to do a little work on it
if its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds
a simple affordable instrument cable
can tune several different instruments
it has no paperwork or owners manual
this is a great stand and highly adjustable
this strap works fine for that
i put new strings on after using this and man
i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical
these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price
ive always been a fan of these fender classic picks
this is a great product
overall its a great deal
if you want a cheap childs gimictype toy this is for you
im sure the huge boss distortion box comes close but for the price
tilts to match personal requirement
i enjoy playing this thing so much
theyre easy to get on and off
im using it as a spare so it should be ok
ive used it for 8 months with no issues at all
the price was great and quality was awesome
if youre hemming and hawing over getting one just do it
this is a great product just not for me
the wire gets stressed at the mic clip andor plug and shorts out
nice work joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist
easier to strum sounds good to me
a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life
i imagine that they will last for years
it is a pleasant addition to my home guitars
i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault
get one of these if you play with a pick
these do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage
i am so in love with my 34pinkie34
i can trust that i will be in tune
i only use aquila strings on my instruments
this pedal also sounds great with gain
use it with an sm58 shure mic in a studio type application
i bought a 34like new34 product describing faded or damaged packaging
this is the only tuner you need
it has exceeded my expectations
the 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects
i have been very pleased with it
unquestionably the sound board was far more sensitive
my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case
tough to even strech this into a full review
the difference is quite noticeable and good
holds neck lightly  easy up easy down
95 of the time this will take care of the problem
nice features on a pedal this cheap
i can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper
i put a pair of these on every guitar that i own
i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems
sound is not so good
power adapters are your friend
these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool
until i can install it i can only really vouch for 45 stars
these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing
no directions inside or on the box
has a great clean tone with a lot of low end
i had to unplugplug maneuver into place
and it works darn well in a quiet environment too
good quality cord and connectors
if you are looking at this guitar buy it
looks like 18x18 to me
if you dont youll wish you did
this is a 000  om acoustic
they make a very deep and loud noise
in my experience this model is inferior
all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly
in fact i typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull
i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week
i avoid this brand of cables
s display to be more than sufficient
di bass is the worst
it fit my ibanez acoustic just fine
comfortable and the grip works wonders
you cannot go wrong with this mixer
he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use
these work better for me than any others ive tried
the pencil condenser are questionable
this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar
the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar
gls is great quality and durable
sometimes lower c and lower a look alike
im very pleased with this purchase
this is very inexpensive and works great for my homewanna be purposes
this highjacks your audio defaults in windows
but it might have if i had not broken its fall
took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye
this music stand is og great quality and of a great price
it also helped with the rather high action
i ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass
and control sound and volume at your fingertips
easy to adjust and holds the ipad secure
they also seem to be quality without bulky
i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar
would the adhesive dry out on this and 2
i am sorry to say that i returned it
but i am going to keep using my dadario strings from now on
at least i dont want to
but i would use no other tuner on stage
with all the other great reviews noted here i decided to buy this guitar
having a dozen similara few for me and a few to sharemeets the need
no big deal just more parts and weight
so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out
totally perfect for holding my guitar
stay away from this one and get a better used pedal
the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud
when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised
the bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there
this analog chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
this strap was very well designed and thoughtout before going to manufacture
i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade
great tuner for my guitar class
count on fender to give u a good product
which you may find here dunlop ergo pickholder
behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this
it pays to shop around
a w e s o m e
the portable feature is great also
terrific bargain for the price
but the pushing against your head is the tight part
the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good
i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home
i should start by saying that i did not buy this from amazon
considering these strings cost much more than others i certainly am disappointed in them
still have my effects rack
and for less than 25 bucks its a bargain
found a sweet spot near area 34234 on the weak instructions
i just cut the volume on my guitar snark senses vibrations through the neck
it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords
it works great so far
ever since then no buzz
battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks
for the money i doubt you can beat these microphones
according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well
i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new
more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice
more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs
the small size means it fits my panniers just fine
i use it with audacity
beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck
the high strings were plenty of flakes
or just disappear from use
free shipping via amazon prime
probably a centimeter or so wider
this pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me
cant ask for much more in a tuner
sounds very authenic 60s too
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
no complaints at all for the price
also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use
i wanted to experiment with this item
i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording
they sound just like i thought they would
it does the job however
this delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion but a nice bit of fuzz
i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine
with the jam i have this
other than that its a good deal for the price
this stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well
i did buy some more expensive magami ones and i cant tell a difference
have had tons of compliments on the sound
built very sturdy with metal and not plastic
saw this in tv yellow and had to have it
turns out this is an amazing amp
it records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models
my fender stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag padded well too
if it didnt i would not buy boss product period
i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac
i have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time
these great little accessories are a nice convenience
i bought a planet waves 9v power adapter to go with the honey tone
maudio was a much better company before avid took them over
it works for what i need
after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand
i am enjoying this guitar
please dont pay someone to setup your guitar
ill wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
kk you have a convert in me
come on were artists so show off your creativity
have to try them more and with other amps
lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable
ive used these strings longer than any other strings ive tried about 7 years
i would recommend this and the quality is good
i had a similar amp before that died
generously ill give it 2stars
the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to 7
i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around
packaging is well thought out too
great product at a excellent price
you get 2 in package with screws so i have a spare
i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan
time to open another carlsberg cheers fender
but not bad and i was using a sensitive rode condenser
well i was dead wrong
this little gem is worth its weight in gold
clean and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely
i mean really work well too
it is a nice clip works for my mics
it stays in perfect tune now
however the price was good
upon arrival i was astonished
certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it
my upgrades if any will be new pots caps wiring nut perhaps tuners
so bottom line im not impressed
the colors and lighting make it very easy to read
i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand
the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me
i ordered this primarily for my 5 string ovation bass
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder
it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for
legs hold up pretty well also
if its not good at least youre not out a lot of money
one is the bright blue light indicating 34on34
based on those criteria the digitech cm2 is perfect
i recommend trying it out
strings are not just strings
i have purchased six so far
they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager
the product description says 6 inches right
these are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer
the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use
dont be surprised if it happens to you
also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more
it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do
the audio is always clipped
no hiss hum breath noises or distortion
behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most
my fingers get sore when playing
what can i say that you havent already read about this amazing pedal
the result was very sore fingers
press again and it begins playback
i bought this not for the tuner but because i needed a metronome
i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at homeand this works great
this is the only string ive ever used that has all of those qualities
just a note of caution though
this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style
i would definatly purchase this again
hey r ford uses them
he liked the result when i switched out the gt 12ax7
it made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar
i put this in a 200 guitar
they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive
its sturdy and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position
i loaded it up with equipment and havent had a worry about it since
i have to say it is spectacular
still its wellconstructed and would make a good desktop mic mount
its not super heavy distortion though
these are very clear and fine tuned
i have a barber ltd which does that beautifully
im really happy with this and would replace it god forbid
the snark i chose has been working just great for me
they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what ive experienced
second time i bought these
they are closer to light than medium
this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 14 instrument ins
that makes what seems like a lot 60 slots get filled up pretty fast
38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these
this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away
i have several of them and they have all performed well
playabilty is very good with low action and good tone
this works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer
its just an imperfect design
see my other review for the world tour gs1 folding tripod guitar stand
did a ton of research out there b4 i bought this
just what i needed to position my guitar while seated
i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing
its also great for vocals as well
it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price
light weight easy to carry
this is the only complaint i have about these strings
i did find the bundled cakewalk software useless
my ukulele has a better tone with these strings
i doubt you can beat this for 25
but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good
purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home
i just ordered mine two weeks ago
ive only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
this little stand serves so many purposes for me
you get what its advertised to do
i have been buying these stands for years and will continue to do so
how complicated can that really be
all in all its a handy little tool to have in the gig bag
this helped them all to stay in place even better than before
really close but they were terrible in operation
the lighter the less tension you should use
i use it for practice and recording myself
it has great tone and sustain wonderful harmonics
this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitechs tl2
but at only 7 this strap is still a steal
the winder is nice and the clipper works well
the quality of the locking tuners looks great
its easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well
i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great
i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal
this item is definitely in the good quality family
the yeti sounds as good
im pleased with both stamps
i use one for my electric and another for acoustic
ease of use and durable
im very satisfied with this pick
when i opened the box was surprised as i didnt notice the usb cable
it is a string winder what more can i say
i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on
air conditioning can do the same
well made and look and feel sturdy
i will be upgrading the caps
worked perfectly for my needs
my sons mom thought it was a toy 34its so small
it is simple and does its job well
it feels like the iphone of delay pedals to me so far
i just needed this for my new guitar
still have yet to mic up a drum kit
they are also easy to do bends which i like alot
every one is superbexcept for this phase 90 the nonscript version reviewed here
the mxr phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen
these are great for all around playing
clean bold and full of smooth overtones that work well
great sound and no wear after one session unlike the daddario strings
this one has a great display  full colour and easy to read
i have a yamaha f335 i really like
a great value for the money
the bag is simple canvas
i just miss the mecanical click of a mechanic metronome
im sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways
dont forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them
came very well packaged and with all the pieces
nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick but its not for me
i bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar
i shall  probably get three or four more
they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while
the last and make playing a breeze
simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all
sorry but thats some big company b
cool pedal on a clean amp
very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime
it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way
this is a great value for a practice and travel instrument
its run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me
they also have a nice full sound and are holding up well
but i like them a lot
i was going to get a pink furry one
help my vocal mics last longer so singers dont drool on my mics
for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable
it is built extremely wellvery solid and sounds incredible
ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not
it is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar
i hit the tone button and all that is done for me
better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me
fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage
right now i have the cr and one original speaker running in my tr
finish is variable be willing to accept whatever shade you get
should of just forked over the money for an ae
quality product for a good price
i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it
i just tried them just to try
its a big step up from that one
but why go to all that trouble
same thing with strings that break while tuning them up
i dont work for the company or have any ties whatsoever
its still a very nice guitar though
the price is great too
it was cheap and came fast
you will not be disappointed in this product
i have to say it is one good funny lookingclip on tuner
may not power some pedals that have a high current draw
and its so cheap it wouldnt matter if you lost it
very nice protection for my luna
i ordered two just in case
forget all the volume drop comments
i bought this because i got tired of looking up byear tuners online
cannot go wrong with this one
heres where you get those strings
but they just keep making them
i dont like these too much
and they dont move around so much like with the bigger triangle one
this amp is for you
no its not the most amazing phase pedal but its still quality
the pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also
and on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the price
i bought this product to use on my amp pots
i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now
supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar
if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else
dont be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better
im getting a few more
and there are two clicks to choose from
nice to keep your mic nice and fresh
i tried another miniamps but all sounds like toys
then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag
i like blues style and classic rock
midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasnt cutting it
stays very firm on the arm
much easier  you dont need to select your tuning or anything first
its a simple cable what can be said
i thought id give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews
long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod
solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect
when you need a nononsense leather strap that is not long consider this
much more grainy and tiny but that may be a plus for you
spend a little extra on another brand
adding the oport deadened the lows
these strings are not overhyped
as far as the vintage tones go
other things worth mentioning its not as heavy as my vox all tube amp
it was a toy not an instrument
ive been using elixir strings for many years
tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years
i placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer
the pick pack contains 24 picks
it is a small thing but i dont like it
i have three of these straps more my strats
do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only
this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music
if it doesnt sound good then i try something else
i very nearly got a different amp
i bought this recently and i love it
first the tuner issues that ive been reading about
a great simple idea that im glad someone put into production
will order again if needed
it will work on pretty much any guitar
admittedly i havent had the time to try this one out
it was only one and it was red
but i prefer the 114 sharps over these
the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches
its adjustable and allows me to fit a clampon microphone boom arm
these are good strings but not 5 stars good
this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly
great match for your bedroom amp
they are clueless arrogant and condescending
its also very easy to install
my guitar had an 11hole pickguard
if not for the hum it would get 5 stars
switchcraft is usually a good product
very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar
the ditto is great for practice though
donr be fooled by the imitations
if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is
i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit
it could be that the string included is a cheap one
actually i bought two of them
if you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one
like i said its a great gig bag
i have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible
they last a long time and my fingers dont hurt when i play
it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound
good life they sound good for a couple of months
this fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along
so for such a simple device you really cant beat it
in terms of the other features i cannot comment
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap
the protector needs to be longer
im elated to know i can now get these buttons separately
often cheap cords die within a year or so
all in all a good deal
it does a great job
its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more
different materials produce different soundsfeels
i am definitely a behringer fan
one has light strings  the other has medium
this is a very good strap lock system
it can it does and its cheaper than i can still believe
super vivid easy to see color
ive never been disappointed by the quality
it can put out up to 1700ma
that requires a cable longer than 6 or 1 foot
good strings help create good sound
the snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me
i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great
great value and good sound
i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember
i teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele
nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well
you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings
ive been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30 years
i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy
i like cakewalks software better anyways just my preference
this coding system is consistent thru all their string sets
buy this with confidence  youll love it
i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps
i have a 1993 taylor which is in mint condition
built well its casing is made out of metal not plastic
both stands showed up in good and working condition
the weight is great for my style of playing
this is a pretty hot pedal
so stop thinking about it and just go buy it
very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal
the tone isnt bad just not as good as a martin uncoated string
i find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things
and if the mistake is due to amazons description returns are generally postagefree
these headphones are 100 amazing
some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to 35db
i love the sound of this pedal
ok 6 trs patch cables 6 long each for 3000
if you havent ever experimented with capos try them out
as for design i dont buy the german innovation advertising line from behringer
the gel in the name sounded intriguing
stopped working all by itself
the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before
i think their pretty accurate
the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made
should the need arise it is also easy to disassemble and assemble
i used this along with a dunlop dc adapter and it all fits nicely
light weight but holds a lot
i also use the ghs standard
its easy to put on and take off and it does its job
this saved med at least 40 instead of getting a traditional preamp
stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity
all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
so far they are holding their tone and brightness
above all it fits my epi lp perfectly
easy to install with patience easy to use
i installed these on a silvertone sd10 which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar
we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system
ah you know im just so used to strings that are individually looped
i am sending them back
im glad i got this thing
all i know is that it just isnt working very well for me
they are inexpensive and they work
if your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 469
this is a great guitar for the money
nice sound in the acoustic too
i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay
the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much
be advised the low e string is thick
i use it on chromatic but it includes  bass uke and guitar too
bought this to use on my 1962 strat reissue
you really cant go wrong
i think this is a good deal
i believe the lead amplug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature
buy a pack and try them out
it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones
much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level
great tuner for the price
no fret noise or hums
gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end
ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now
they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice
they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing
it does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005
im just a dude in a band
i am a longtime musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments
i would buy another if i needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument
im pretty new to this so i take the blame
others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys
these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently
i cant expect miracles at that pricepoint but i certainly expected better
the master and gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel
it required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup
after three days the battery goes out
i bought i thought it was cool and different
i used it for several years but it is only a backup now
does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down
it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident
i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp
quality company great strings great price
i cant see it marring the guitar at all
nice quality and love the cutter
always high quality for a reasonable price
look forward to getting those crappy loose unsmooth original hardware tuners off this thing
these are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were
otherwise youll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup
i play the soprano concert tenor and baritone
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs
first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board
sorry folks but id skip this one
this pick literally makes you play better
the quality is great for me
you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose
unfortunately it was the wong switch
i was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this
stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock ping tuners
the issues include what i think may be premature breakage
this is a great size
another doesnt and is very clean even on the factory preset clean
its just a practice amp
i wont have to listen to them
great for beginners or the pros
overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand
the plugs are of excellent quality also
the price was the bestanywhereand with free shipping i couldnt be happier
tests multiple types of cords also
the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside
needed a pre amp tube for my hartke lh500 and ordered one of these
clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well
i cant recommend this pedal enough
you really cant go wrong here
meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units
wish the phase came in a different case
the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened
after couple of weeks i also noticed some volume variations as i played
it seemed to work very well in this role
there is also amic holder
my kids love to hear me play it
each one sat just right
hands down the best cable i have ever owned
now you wontactually find any actual 2x4s
square pad allows placement right next to the fret
you can loop an effects processor thru it
no stress whatsoever indeed its just as quick and smooth as my boss
just a bag for my guitar stand
i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones
it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do
the price is dead cheap
add to this 16 digital presets
i purchased these to replace the springs on my usa standard stratocaster
this mic is really nice
what i love about this pedal is the tone knob
get it you wont be sorry
use it with your headphones or home speakers
besides the volume these differences werent huge
the rubber grip area is great
i am so psyched that i found this microphone its perfect
the cable also looks nice and completes the fender look
wish all pedals were built this way
im sure the screws are okay but i wouldnt trust them myself
plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck
it definitely worked a lot easier than the untreated microfiber cloth
you can barely hear it in the next room
only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad
theres no resistance on that joint so it flops down
ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors
this pedal is tubescreameresque but not as midrangeheavy as a ts
the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism
i hate having to drill a hole in my guitars
try to keep the sponge moist when its dry
sounds great on my sg and my acoustic
very happy with this item
but for me tone is 80 of the equation
this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks
ive mostly used it with the default settings
i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit
i use these pins on some of my 34 size guitars
the plugs are also of the highest quality
i have used it on mandolins guitars violins and violas and double bass
you dont have this guitar
im a real klutz with my cords
i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars
lots of relief between strings and body
i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well
the colorcoded end balls help with the restringing
there is one area where the pig prevails
no sign of wear and tear
this is my second case from them
these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them
ive used these and dont have any problem with them
i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner
you have just simply got to try this little guitar stand
its cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much
light weight allows you to remove quickly
i decided to try them out
they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings
90 gauge at guitar center and love them
the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge
i would definitely recommend this
use 5 of them in my case and they work well
highly recommended for the occasional strummer
might as well go allin
the presence knob isnt a midrange control but does boost the upper mids
it looks better in person than in the pic too
i really cant think of anything negative to say about it
yes i would recommend them to other uke players
i pushed the stand and
none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying
across the web reviews for the to800 are uniformly favorable
at 12 per shot who cares
works great and easy to use
i can deal with it
crisp and fresh tone for a long time
very easy to take offput on
although it does exactly what it says
bought these and they worked great with my digitech delay reverb chorus and jaman
ill just nip the ends off if i need to replace them later
this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal
that being said i dont play heavy at all
i highly recommend this strap
i use this for my ipad
i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications
duncan type often suffer from nonpositive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed
for everyone else it should fit pretty comfortably
they feel great sound great and are extremely cheap
both of my snarks have broken off at this joint
these cables are great in microphone or dibox applications
are you likely to find it in a highend professional studio
it does just what i wanted it to do
i havent used the battery pack so dont know about battery life
this acessorie is well builded and dont change the guitars pitch
disregarding those flaws its still obvious that its not a good case
i returned this one early
these days on my pedal board i have several mxr micro pedals
i bought a 2nd one
its almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing
the topend professional compressors keeley pedals rack units etc
lets just say this id never gig with this guy as my only tuner
very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings
but for what it is it is fantastic
id order again if i had to
i also put a pop filter on it
overall i like these picks a lot
they are wellmade easy to play guitars
you will have to adjust your strap from the other side
the thing is built like a piece of s
they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap
windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups
as for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generoussized screws etc
gerlitz makes this wax easy not greasy
its okay but it could be better
the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition
if youre looking for some ridiculous review this wont be one
bottom line is that it works very well for my needs
nice padded seat well constructed
the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny
if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice
however ive used one of these boards before
if i had the money id stick one of these on all my guitars
i cant wait to see what they do next
i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive
i had to get used to this tuner at first
hard to day too much but it works great
you just have to try them and see
i think it is about the actual mass
a good price a good buy
as my reviews demonstrate im a sucker for a new tuner
i rate it at 5 stars
i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake
you click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop
i had that one first and it is horrible to use
it sounds great for blues and rock
works great with my fender super champ x2 amplifier
the sd1 is widely owned and very affordable usually around 50
very sturdy and awesome pop filter
great strings with a good feel to them
dunlop univibe uv1  cool stainless steel construction
it gets softer with time and use
i put a quarter under the 10th
it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed
i love the colors and the matte finish too
i have several now one for every guitar
these may be my new favorite bass strings
its not very compact when folded but im still giving it 5 stars
i bought this microphone for youtubepodcasting and it does a really perfect job
in particular they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars
pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion
this is a simple analog chorus
this was another filler item for a much larger order
in 40 years i have had every kind of capo out there
overall build quality is very nice
there are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about
i got this china and was blown away by it
beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily
the guitar can be placed in strings up or down
i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didnt work
guess ill go back to daddario and ernie ball
there was no perceptible delay
these are by no means touring cases
great strings for just a little more
first lets not expect 500 double 1634 sound from a portable 9v amp
otherwise it gets a big hard to read
back to the drawing board i go
this is a review for themahalo u30pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink
i like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack
for the price this is the perfect pop filter
im very happy with the purchase and the price was right
obviously cardboard isnt going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths
are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts
these headphones get the job done
elixir is my favorite brand of strings
they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect
marshalls based on 59 bassman without the delicate touch so theres no wonder
except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels
this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length
maudio doesnt stand behind their products and ill never purchase anything from them again
i have even sold the picks at garage sales 25 cents each
i have a lot of pedals
your loop can be as long as 10 minutes with unlimited overdubbing
its light portable and fairly sturdy
no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use
i use it for my small solo gigs
i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables
i play for fun and relaxation
the price seems fair enough
great product  well made  worth every penny
no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing
i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smellfree case
i have a 75watt amp that powers a 12 celestion speaker
i am very happy with the elixir brand strings
a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords
it stays where you set it and works wonderfully
so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love
i have a heavy epiphone eb0 bass and this strap is a lifesaver
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated
im still using my roland stomp box tuner
maybe they will last longer
pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to
i highly recommend this cable
i put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less
it was time to replace all with frest strings
the quality and durability are there 100 well worth what i paid for
there is also an embossed model brown offered at minimumly higher price
there are better guitars out there but not for 170
they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat
it would keep me from buying another one of these
my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust
arrived as promised in a frustration free packing
my son loves them for metal
old tech bungee type of capo
100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist
great little pedal economical and worked flawlessly
it is also just great to 34hang34 on the headstock went not in use
i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word
this wah petal is so much fun
im possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20 years
i would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black
being able to angle the unit is great
now put that order in
they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gellike feeling
youre still getting a good deal
it makes my recording convenient
i bought 5 of them from amazon because they were such a good price
also i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to
as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value
nifty little item that does what its designed to do
big and wide enough to handle any guitar
this guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck
the 9led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern
this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks
i used to work for line 6 so i know modeling pedals
from extra slinky to heavy gauge jazz strings  you just cant go wrong
just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq
the leather is very soft and flexible
ive played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever
looks really cool and sounds great
for practice or in your house these are probably the way to go
it tuned up very easily and for me it holds tune nicely
i cant see how they could improve this at all
ive tried a few different straplock options and these are the best
thats about as trouble free as ive seen in this type of device
i have tried few picks textured mallow color and this bright green
it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters
perfect size and does its job
im surprised by the results
real cost saver on batteries
i use the  exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads
very small changes can have large effects
great picks not just for jazz though
this is an excellent gig bag
the description says the color is gold
an inexpensive but nice set
however this worked fine as a plain tuner
but for casual use this one is completely fine
these are also sturdy and look very good
just the design man go planet waves
yeah i know  never heard of it
the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play
i used 220 grit sandpaper
i brought my baggs para acoustic di and i was glad i did
but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me
this one is much better although not quite as portable
the true test was an actual live performance
the second one i tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage
this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul
dont leave any room for modulation or other special fx
enter the joyo jf09 tremolo
i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners
also please check your intonation
these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics
so i dunno what that other guy was complaining about
hope this helps some novices i had to learn it this way myself
they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune
my guitar doesnt fall down anymore
i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point
was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat
it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap
light weight compact and all in one tool what more could i ask for
all in all a beautifully designed and executed product
i would recommend this to any guitar player
of worlds crappiest pot metal
some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet
this little foot stool is really sturdy
stick to nickel and you will be glad you did
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
im very happy when i got this gig bag
decent strings dont cost very much
their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover
see my review of that item for clarification
had one pick inside as a place holder
its at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe
kind of like using a gm part on my 68 chevelle
i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed
i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake
it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily
to do so youll see a black knob at the base of the pedal
this compares to my other compression pedals i own
again maybe not 750 good but at least 250300 good
i have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now
just place it upside down
you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes
lets see what its got to offer for under 100
this is it right here
for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect
but these ones really get the guitars shining up really nice
all in all im happy with it
great for what i needed
for what its worth i am a professional musician with perfect pitch
i cant explain it exactly
forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one
this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound
i like the flexibility of this microphone cable
i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows
to me the hot plexi sounds more real closer than this
if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap
this case will definitely do the trick
this stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way
these things work really great
wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars
the telescope mechanism is quite well made
it fit perfect and gives the fender name to a saga kit guitar
the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful
they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas
i didnt remember where id gotten it or even the manufacturer
the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily
this is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment
it has a very natural sound is reliable and amazingly strong
a great addition to an already great amp
the vintage bbds mxr vintage delay morley 70s echo for example just take it
constructed well works perfectly rolls up nicely with no kinks
nice mids and ringing highs
you dont plan to adjust it much and3
i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound
i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip
ive added a photo of my board
excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised
this is my 6th kyser capo
i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal
so theres nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2
i have only 2 requirements for a tuner 1
behringer is the way to go
i really cant find any negative about it
i also really like the nylon material
this guitar is pretty good for the price
excellent guitar picks of medium hardness
great deal for the money
washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries
i never thought that it would be so solid
for its price and qualityi giving it a 5 star  o
they are worth the extra cost
a few are actually a notchabove the others
these were purchased on a whim
rich but not too over powering
i bought him two different types he he liked them both
the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool
any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally
ever since i started playing the guitar ive used the nylon dunlop picks
perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets
good presentation and well packed
intensity range seemed less than other pedals too
this is an absolute musthave item for any gigging drummer
my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin
i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one
but once i got it locked in ive never touched the knobs again
nice for collectable or to use
this is a nice little tuner
at least its long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures
its heavy enough that it doesnt flex unnecessarily
the point is this pedals so great and has a great range of dirt
if this is the case spend the money to get a nicer filter
but i stomp on it regularly
my experience with the tungsol tubes was very very negative
its clean bright and loud
that would be the top of the deal
i got it because i need a second tuner
my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets
place it gently no need to press it too hard
what a great price and product
the cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups
it is a must to have these
there is plenty of room for all my needed connections
i needed a new strap but i didnt want to pay 20 for one
it is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly
probably my second favorite after ernie ball
i own the old ibanez ts9 that i modified to the original keeley specs
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good
it is so simple and so reproducible
some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit
this little tuner is very precise
it keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely
no buzzes no hums no nonsense
the only things i dont like are 21each of the corners has a cap
they last with great tone for a reasonable time and dont break
like always boss products are just amazing
its a lot quieter now
i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers
they dont make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible
these fender locking tuners are top quality
the edge is now smooth and nice
heres my take  for what its worth
with these pins the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it
youll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions
check the polarity of the tip  is the tip positive or negative
i have been playing guitar offon for about 30 years
you really cant go wrong with this capo
some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use
so he mentioned this capo and i immediately chortled
i will use them again in the future
i was expecting it to be a little stiffer but im glad it isnt
just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it
they worked out just fine
the draw back is the battery installation
this is a nicer set
the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides
but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings
i may swamp them out fo this one
for the most part yes
this cable is built to last
both by vibration and mic
the first two are pretty heavy and bulky
just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this
if you use ext mic
glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig
this is a pretty cool product
btw this seller really got these to me fast
the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go
this fits just right and looks just right
each adjusted to and held its guitar securely
for me i like the heft of these cables
the strap i got was a levys with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable
they didnt solve any problems or make anything better
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
this does not turn off when i do that
if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups esp
i have not used any lock system thats perfect
however i dont like the plastic end pieces
bought this hosa pedal cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal
this works in some applications but doesnt work in many others
it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box
so for the price these are an excellent value
i love this cable they look good and are well made too
i would definitely recommend this
seems like spring is a bit too strong
sometimes its noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome
the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable
he uses elixir for both and swears by them
i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard
this one work great for us
its great in all ways but one  the rubber feet constantly fall off
i cant imagine not using it now that i have it
a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin
the clean tones are nice and warm
it actually holds a couple of picks less
an ipad mini would probably fit
i bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great
the dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive
the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life
i wasnt planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar
the interference went away after a few minutes
once youve got them in or attempted to do so theyre never coming out
and that makes me want to play twice as long
its possible that i just lucked out with a good one
so this is more than adequate for daily practice
when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah
however as simple as it is it is definitely a useful tool
got this for my wife she just loves it
i have no complaints about it
i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best
i replaced the strings right away
this is a quick easy improvement
they are about halfsheet size
once i read about the bugera b5 i knew i wanted one
they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels
great fender quality for a great price
it works perfect with my boss pedals
great price at amazon as usual
the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin
the virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes
buy this it does work and it works very well
ive been very disappointed with this tuner
ive owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years
theyre elixirs you just cant go wrong with elixirs
it is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back
it still works but thats a design flaw
microphone is quite good for such price
now anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise
it has had no issues at all
i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile
no more couch and kitchen chairs for me
after 40plus years of playing daddario rocks
i have an older model that i still use also
i love the size and wouldnt want anything larger
for the money its a crazy deal
the guitar sounded pretty good
turning it on though the display is quite different
one for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great
it was incredibly easy to install
then your oktava will fit just fine
folds up and sets up comfortably and easily
i dont ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are
my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny
it is definitely one to consider and the price is not that bad
i simply dont see any reason to switch atm
it feels sturdy not that i would drop it
the mike in the picture looked bluish to me
includes screws and 1 washerfor the jack
i would recommend having it around just for that
their tone is great and the nanowebs feel nice when youre playing
once i added other pedals there became a horrible hum
maybe i will try it again at some point but
every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support
my ears remain attentive to future string sounds
i have two of these now and they may be my favorite
i found that it just added more weight
you get what you pay for
it should be for the price
update   we received a replacement for this item
with this little gadget there is no guess work
the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control
i found instructions through a google search
i personally found the mullard to be the best
good height adjustment for sitting or standing
its not just a uke tuner
i have a feeling this one will last a long time
your hand floats over the frets
did you think you could fool all of us out here
ive been using it for a few weeks and im extremely happy with it
frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb
the key to the onespot is the 1700ma output
i put a heil fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax
they are comfortable to use
only complaint is the size which is my fault
i tested this and yes it does go louder for whatever the reason
try the behringer cs400 for more sustain
for a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill
i have been using this preamp for a year and it has been great
i bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality
but its held together fine so far and ive had it for weeks
needed patch cables for my pedal board
it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well
great accessary for yamaha keyboards
this pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy
very easy to install as compared to other systems
mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue
they all work fine for me
not a good start though
i like the layout of controls as well
i love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings
i actually bought three of them
i purchased this to use with my old yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele
do you like guitar music
it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic
i dont use it all that often though
this not the first swing hanger i have
leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes
id been looking a taylors but didnt want to spend that much money
i put it in my cart and continued shopping
spring for the extra bucks and be happy
i have it going into my mixer which works fine
i bought my spyder jam back in 2009 when it was fairly new
the casing is made of heavy duty i dont know what gauge solid steel
looks great on any guitar
a friend had and os2 on hand and let me use it
ive spent time and money way more than 1000 free advice
just buy the product and get on with happy music making
in addition this one has a metronome
addendum   i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributormanufacturer
i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it
overall some of the best strings available
i wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after i change guitars
i have used many clipon guitar tuners
i play 2 gigs a week on average and practice everyday
these do definitely have more output
i purchased this to teach myself to play a keyboard instrument
looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way
good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly
the loop feature is quite good the delayecho entirely satisfactory
nothing but praise for this item
all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue
in the end they are all the same
keeping the pick clean and dry does help
i thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk
i do not use it for powering only one pedal though
means only that dr 40
a must have five star item
what more can you ask from a tuner of this price
im a bit indifferent to this mod
i will not recommend to other musicians
invest in a daisy chain spot or the like
i like using this clean
those strings made it hard to play so i tried these daddario mandolin strings
this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought
my choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics
the apogee jam works great and it sounds great
but these are as advertised
they are all bold and in your face
not sure how they will last time will tell
top is a bit wavy from buffing
easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip
no more chasing pitch for me
works as described on the ipad
i got these for the build in pop screen
it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer
ive been through my john pearse phase
this is the newer version of the original snarks
the frets are properly aligned and the instrument stays in tune
i bought it for a very large body 34f34 hole electric guitar
so i put these on my 1978 musicman stingray bass
caps are marked 223k so looking that up they are 0022uf
if youve never used this stile picks you wont be sorry
very simple and works very well
im a typical overweight american
it stays in tune and is fun to play
the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well
i have several mxr pedals
the readout is easy to see in any light
i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base
the effects are better than id hoped for
buy it and you will see
there is a white stripe running around the outer edge
i have had it for three months now and it is still fine
being see through distracts me
purchased for hanging two rockband pseudo guitars
no one can touch amazons price and service
no rocking sideways no wobbly action
update  1912 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand
build quality is as solid as they come
they all need an external windscreen but only the sm7b comes with one
nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern
it does its job and its well worth the money
this pick is great for strumming
i havent tested the soundfeature but ive seen it on videos
the stand works as advertised
the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth
so i snapped one up just like everyone else
allinall i found no flaw in these strings
009 string or 1st string was not in there
no other choice on the market imho
the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a lightmedium
its a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works
this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes
it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it
i took it out of the box and started to play
ive been using these for years
im a teacher not a student
ive had this for nearly a year and i have no complaints
i got this for my wireless mics but they dont fit in this holder
i have had multiple mistakes and frustrations
1st time i saw it was 40 years ago
the rubber housing is an excellent idea
well everything is being returned except this pedal
even if it doesnt save a whole lot of time its very ergonomic
get off the fence and buy this pedal
same made in china product with another no name logo stuck to it
excellent pedal i love this chorus
i hope it goes away with use
they are a little scratchy on the edges
recently i switched from a blackstar ht5 to a fender mustang iii v2 amp
i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and 4 acoustics
elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment
i even use it when im drumming
i just looked at pics on the net and got them close
still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer
i put it on the boom of my mic stand
very glad i bought the  planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter
i will use these for my lower end stuff i will probably sell anyway
i solved the battery problem by using a 1spot 8outlet pedal power supply
these hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended
this one was a good deal through amazoncom
the stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe
instead i got a decent set of
i found that a palms width from the tip of the mic works best
but it does its job
im quite happy with any of the on stage brand stuff i have
uncolored 20db of clean gain
you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves
but overall i like it
there is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start
usb with this shockmount as well as the at2020 usb and xlr version
dont buy the high rated chrome capped ones i had problems with those
what i like about this one is how the release lever works
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
will this even work on a 6string bass
if you place it on your music sheet stand thats great
i come back to purchase another
soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level
i will definitly look into their other products
i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap
the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone
first i was fortunate enough to buy one for 300
you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item
but as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from martin
but since i found a good solution i dont think its worth the effort
i will definitely purchase this kit again when i run out of the supplies
its easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks
these picks are translucent purple
save your money unless your under 10 years old
i shall probably order more from this company in the future
i just losen 6543 string and just put it in and it was over
no problems with static crackling hum or other sound artifacts
i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions
so far it has functioned well and i do use it a lot
certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily
if you need more than this i dont know what to tell ya
i have dozens of guitars
you literally cannot find a better guitar for 150 than the special 2
the g2s seem to resonate everywhere
still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast
the size is 34just right34 not too small or big
this tu3 is easier to see and is more precise in its tunings
this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand
but for the price 199 its a real gem
i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier
only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar
my mic200 and mic800 are much better than this
had it for about two weeks and im about to return it now
ill have this thing forever
the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddysounding
these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price
until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo
this is a good purchase
if you really want a capo get a keyser or other decent capo
delay and chorus are also pretty good
ive seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead
i did replace the strings shortly after getting it
the tuners are basic but they work well
i particularly like the right angle plug
doesnt leave the strings oily or full of residue
im a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher
one other thing that i had in mind so ill say it here
for me this pedal gets you 80 of the way there
for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient
what the hot tubes does is anything but 34familiar34 from an affordable od pedal
i dont blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these
i got it earlier then expected and i love it
however i found it can only be attached in one place
the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp
original reviewi have had similar tuners in the past
actually theyre not fender they are schaller but that is really good
the built in shock mount is definitely a plus
cant beat it for the price
but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too
so why the new strap
this takes up at least the space of 2 pedals
this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date
purchased these for a new heritage h575 arch top
if you need something more accurate i recommend investing in a good pedal
id recommend it for finding what suits you
gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop
its high quality but i didnt consider it trying to pull my shirt off
that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable
no odd muting or dropouts
mmm i would still highly recommend using an audible metronome
only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort
theres no substitute for the right part
bought this on a whim
for guitar playing i use it in close proximity on a desktop
it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand
didnt test microphones yet but i think this is best price for 7 microphones
these snark tuners are really cool
so i worked on my technique some more
the locks work great and give you an added sense of security
does not have good sound but hey
i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome
its really overboard in a way that i didnt find musical
i returned mine as it just didnt fit well for my uke or mandolin
cant speak to durability because havent had them long and havent used them heavily
pretty basic strap but durable and works for me
im a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups
i found this one to be made well enough that it plays well
the other two tuners dont have this issue
the color is nice and bright
ultimately theyre simply the best for the money
and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp
either they feel good in your hand or they dont
i bought epiphone cases for all of them
this is definitely a high quality cable
its almost like having a new guitar
jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cutout
this does a fine job of cutting even a thick e bass string
it holds my heaviest books without tipping over
i love these picks for playing my acoustic
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs
i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f335 and they look stunning
eg low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string
is all i can say
this bridge has more strength and solidness than the original
there is a lot to think about with a strap lock
great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these
however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend
if comfort is not important to you then get this strap
nope you cantd tap tempo
using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder
just what the guitar doctor ordered
my only real gripe isnt unique to this model but to all snarks
probably will never stop buying them
these work like a light switch
whats even better is how long they last
the dimensions are  41l 14w at bout and 3 deep
i will buy these again for sure
and no im not hawking epiphone
hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings
all my guitars have piezo bridges
have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon
bottom line  inexpensive wellmade accurate timesaving
same manufacturer but different models
i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic
i gave these strings a try but i dont care for them that much
im amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice
the wedgie is exactly what ive been looking for
super sturdy easy to put intake out
i recommend it a lot
everything is connected using this single length patch
the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good
then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages ibooks etc
this device has delivered everything i wanted and more
this is lownoise compared to the mxr and simple to use
this stand works fine if you dont need a shock mount
the sound quality is amazing
easy to use efficient sturdy looks nice and sounds great
recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig
so you can have this thing on the go
if you are an angry stomper go elsewhere
lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp
pros extremely easy to use and widely compatible 62 no batteries required
this device sounds okay its usable
may be for the big one
small price to pay to be in tune
52514  i said the case had no handle well i take that back
appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever
oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixirs
it is accurate  very reasonably priced
just as the others have said
as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable
however at 10 a piece i have to give it 5 stars
its solid and works well
its bulky but it works well
its worth its weight in gold
what a racket it is
it is rather heavy and i like that
you can never go wrong with real fender parts
and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg4 guitar stand
just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it
the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy
again though not that big a deal to fix if its not
summary  just the factsa great pedal and my favorite univibe of all
price was a big issue
you will be pleased and your bank account will thank you
to each his own they say
durable yet lightweight and sturdy
love the sound it produces
on a personal level id prefer it didnt say epiphone on the outside
my kids are all interested in learning the uke
you have to actually play one to understand what im talking about
the signal processing takes place in the unit not the pedal
these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems
far and away my favorite amp model evah
in the beginning i had problems
im sorry but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive
made of metal it should last a lifetime
and no tape or other sticky stuff
it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound
bag was getting kind of heavy at that point
some say that the grip is good
so far this power supply is great
dont know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat
234 wide nylon strap is well made comfortable and should last many years
this also has a bolt on neck
works plugged in or unplugged
it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine
interestingly this is really the only usb 20 device in this range
this little bottle goes a long way
move the switch down to the low midscoop mode
the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools
oh by the way i have an s6 for sale
reaching for pics is never a problem
the tuner works amazing as well
im thinking of getting another because of this
i havent tried the computer interface yet
i picked up an old boss me6b that required the boss bra120 power supply
excellent little device for the money
i love wicker on and tone off
another thing is the price point which is simply amazing
i have been using hercos for for many years
it does a fantastic job
if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can
this eq achieves almost the same results and i paid less
i would purchase these again for my needs
if im committed to learning ill get a better one later
fits in your pocket gig bag etc
only complaint battery doesnt last too long
none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string
if you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here
great clarity and definition even on higher gain settings
dont ask me how it works but it does
they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing
then theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed
for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track
overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
once i figured out how to set it up
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
not much to say other than its a good cable
nothing else ive tied it to has seemed to work out though
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds1
the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate
overall i am quite pleased with these
good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this
cant say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design
mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe
i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system
does what it should and yamaha quality
i thought i could take the smell
i have a 300 strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it
ive been using them for 6 months or so
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
i prefer them at 90 degrees so these are just right
i got this for use with the boss dd20 as a taptempo
you will notice that some areas soak it more than others
this pedal is a great delay pedal
ive switched to using the builtin compressor in my digitech bp90 instead
it loaded right up with no problem
they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range
it has no depth to it
i dont think youll regret it
it is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard
great tool and good quality product
sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords
for 100 if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well
makes my life easier when i pack up and set up the equipment
it sounds great with little of its own noise
no regrets on the buy at all
for 40 its an awesome deal
also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip
no power cord was included in mine or manual
an experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me
it gives the boost i need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever
everything else plugs right in
it really makes your guitar shine
aside from that though great product
affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchase
maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage
same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with
i really like the idea of a 34pick34 pocket in the strap
these would probably better suited to guitarists
it sounds exactly like how i always imagined like in all those records
its ok but not the best fog machine out there
all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra
snug fit but imo not too tight
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
this is a solid product
when im in a apt
this seems like a nice high quality cable
it does what a guitar tuner should do
i was expecting a soso mike for the price boy was i surprised
the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds
this may have been the best money ive ever spent for a guitar accessory
cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster
it just makes things sound solid
i could never get the levels right
but that costs 2x or more as much
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store
wish i had found this stuff sooner
i stand by my logically opinions of this item
pup plate maladjusted and off quite a bit
other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price
im pleasantly surprised with this cable
even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dustshedding they do
nice sound for a nice price
it would be more suited to home or hobby use
i bought this for my 1974 martin d18 for recording on my pc
they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings
i just slapped one of these on my reliced 94 mim fender strat
i bought one for every bass and a spare
that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use
if you play a string instrument this one is a must
so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h4 recorder
when this showed up in a cable search on amazon i jumped on it
believe this 5 feet cable is no small thing
i only have used this tuner on classical guitars the ones with nylon strings
little to no excess residue
it is exactly what i was hoping it would be
not sure the new set is either but time will tell
but we dont know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain
right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones
lack of a mid control
wow im really impressed with this tuner
initially the product didnt work
this guitar i would recommend to anyone
once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer
this switch does work but you should look before you leap
i dont drop em anymore
definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard
well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts
i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions
we are a perfect match pizza and me
if i could make one i would
my first time using it but like it alot since it works good
one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired
recommend for small budget studios
storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks
it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat
i do not recommend this product
you can jam for hours with this thing its awesome
5 stars on that alone
did boss just start making multieffects pedals
dunlop ultex picks sound much better
this tuner looks nice and works great
theyre a whole new world
assembly was pretty easy and took little time
if youre looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model
warehouse deals are not such good deals
otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me
the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween
sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work
pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price
why i waited so long to get one i cant say
016 of the daddarios i usually play
im glad i bought it and would buy from the company again
i hope if yall get one
my guitar originally came with daddrio exp and they sounded good
overall i love this pedal at under 60 bucks
then theres the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadnt considered
i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good
i could not be happier
i bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son
you lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning
so i returned it and they lost the sale
crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get 34mudded34 out
found a method done by another searching online
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own
its got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too
once i figure that out all was right again in my universe
the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine
if so youve got a bargain on some great cans
good material good zippers good design
itll do for setup work and the price is right
does what its suppose to
its simple built well and and fun to use
you can count on planet waves quality
makes nicks and scratches less noticeable
i will be selecting solely on price
it comes with a cord that has a standard 14 inch end
i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture
very happy and pleased with this one
i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work
now aesthetically this uke isnt as pleasing as say a martin sorpano
it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal
every guitar ive ever cared about has had this strap on it
some people pick on behreinger because theyre stuff is still cheap
sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here
i like the sound and feel of these picks
not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions
it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything
its an amazing tool for keyboard player
these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics
now i know i would love a better one like a fishman
i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc
lets hope this is just a shortterm fluke
those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere
mine initially came with middle position
looks great feels great and works great
the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings
unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights
they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre
and the blue pedal isnt any different either imo
this powergrip pedalboard mounting tape is velcro on steroids
thats not the case here
material is similar to my messenger bags strap
its not that hard though and the reward is worth it
for the price this is a great deal
easy install and great price
effects loop is on the front
these cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp
and botique quality at paupers price
no more thick calouses on the fingers
if you dont mind spending the time to learn all its capabilities its great
used it once but once was enough
i have big hands which may be part of it
the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar
for 50 there is seriously no better deal
this is a perfect addition to any serious rig
no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors
had them over two months a they work great
i bought primarily for travel and im pleased with my purchase
i gave one to my grandnephews
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing
i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter
this was what i needed and it was cheap
it works perfect for those hard ps and strong s sounds
im not sure about a transistor amp
the reviews on amazon helped as well along with youtube demos and guitar mags
i have recommended this stand to others also
it is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship but not stellar
i dont know how a pro would rate this
comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer
i originally rated this pickup 5 stars
i keep ordering more of these picks
i does just what it should and for the price its pretty good
worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard
for a cheap pedal i gave this a try
dials and sliders work smoothly
wellllllllllll just give it a try
so if necessary give it a tryand more than one
i dont detect any loss of tone
build good for carry and balance
they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff
boy did i hit a home run with that
update   played for a couple hours
this cable is very well constructed
no way to send it back im not from the states
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
ill stick with what i know well
its a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder
we got this one for my wifes mandolin
not so good outside if there is a fair breeze
these are some of my favorites
i have a 180 amp but was looking for something a little more portable
they shorted me a gold screw
it can get loud enough over drums etc
tons of verb if you want it
i use sound studio but the included free softwareaudacityworks practically as well
this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase
finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem
and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure
this is a wonderful item that really works
i really like this tuner
i also bought a lesson book for drums for myself
the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
y con una buen duravilidad
i have just receive mine just now
this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price
sounds great on amps and perc
i use it with distortion and overdrive with good results
i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass
you wont find a better deal than this on a basic headphone ampmixer
you get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness
they are comfortable too as far as ear pads go
ive been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel
comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal
again the us100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities
i order 2 of these for my electric guitars
i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration
so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
i opted for the 300 and got it for 25
this one is a winner hands down
its what they do and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal
the fender vibro champ is a great little amp
its better because it cleans all 6 at once
by some sort of mixup i got nanowebs by mistake
the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich
however the prices for these on amazon are absurd
plug it in and its ready to go
super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered
i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together theyre fail safe
but what do i know
i would buy this again
the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time
the box is ultra solid
makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half
it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable
they did what i expected them to do
havent noticed any hum or crackles
trust me on this one
my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me
for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case
theres better ones out there
adjustments for intensity and length
it is heavy and small what gave us attack
no guitar effects or drum patterns like bosss br micro 4 and 80
i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings
its all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn
its solid well made and looksfeels like it can handle the world tour
alot of zoom h1 users put this over their mics
things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke
the satch amplug is a welcome addition to my collection
loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone
but come back to these every time
i can see this strap lasting a long time
the second one is working fine so far
it is probably the most favored pick among all companies
different in a wow way
i still own most of these units except for this one
id prefer a better stand however i question its existence
blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store
its chromatic so it will tune anything
reliable last a while and more important theyre inexpensive
i previously used krk rp8s so i can compare these to them
one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use
they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot
the same goes for tilting
to me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed
i was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked
seems like it draws current even when its off
its kind of tough at first but with experience its very easy
the switch well we will have to wait and see
ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly
this harpbb has a beautiful tone
check out this rather entertaining howto video to see the installation process
excellent bag for tripods or stands that dont need a lot of protection
im a beginner so im not very picky on the accessories yet
after these strap break in though they are very soft and supple
at least for a few weeks
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others
the bad the driver for this thing is horrible under windows xp
not much else to say about it  it polishes my guitar very nicely
im a songwriter and record my own demos at home
but i took a chance  this works well on my lp
the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too
i use it as a pa for practicing and it is a godsend
these are perfect for a fastpaced style of picking
then youre left with several pieces to schlep
ill use a stand if im going to use a guitar often
just picked up the korg pitchblack from guitar center yesterday
these strings sound great with great dynamics on them
i could not believe the sound quality
hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music
i did this drawing on my guitarplaying knowledge
so far it is working great
i looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one
i play 5string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff
the velcro itself is insanely amazing
i purchase these strings a lot for my son
turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done
tascam should consider a similar accessory
i like to walk around while i play
i sometimes play in a park or outside around the bbq
it attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar
for the price this stand just cant be bet
its explained in the manual but could be clearer
i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
nothing fancy they just work
2 things i forgot tuners wanna say 15 1
you can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings
the cutter snips the strings with no effort
this is just an excellent product
this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod
it does not vary the pitch
my new guitar had only the back strap connector
i also tested it with audacity in recording my voice
its fine if no one hears you
i have several of these capos one for each instrument
ive owned a halfdozen led music stand lights over the years
not so much for a guy
the only thing i wouldve like different is the accessory box inside
undoubtedly better for more accomplished players
it might work in a busker situation
its different sounding from the crybaby wah
i was surprised at how heavy the base was
wish id have gotten something a little nicer though
for the price id expect a more durable product
great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks
its relatively inexpensive small and light weight
they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase
for anyone who plays acoustic guitar  these things are so handy
this company dunlop gets it right with the mxr line
behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit
i bought these to replace a pair of athm45s i had for 6 years
the device is simple and fairly solid
leave it in the office
they use the same chip
whats also amazing is that its still around a 150
all switches knobs plugs  display work fine
item body is plastic rather than metal
the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options
it was the right price for me right now
these are great for connecting effects pedals
i have used these without any problems whatsoever
its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it
i like much more than the joyo fuzz
you will like them on the guitar
neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed
what you see is what you get
if it doesnt work you hate it
you might be surprised how good it sounds
but they most certainly are not
it works and it works well
phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine
bright and easy to read
and the price was right
who knows what real quality would cost these days
its full of sonic options
this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from
this is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound
i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar
if all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue
unlike the bad monkey this doesnt have an additional mixer  cabinet emulated output
hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning
it is so simple and so reproducible
the jasmine s34c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price
i love the sustained bright tone
what else can i say
ive now retired the boss pedal
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well
be advised though that it only registers natural notes and sharps
this is one of the few cases where id buy new over used
what can you say about a pick
so it may not work in some configurations
the pins measure  28mm or 1 14 inches in length
solid well built and should last
robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble 75
the board itself is made out of welded metal and its very sturdy
they are easy on my fingers and give great tone
i have used on all my guitars
otherwise these are a good value with easy on  off
thus far i am very pleased
treat these like halogen bulbs
good strings and not overly prone to corrosion
these are a little course for what i wanted
i love the picks the tin they come in and the ease of use
now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic
i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller
the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain
80 but i still like the tortex picks for that as well
a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power
i like their longevity too
i would buy this product again
this is a perfect strap for my guitar
it was just what i needed to give me clean sound
this is the best cleaning product ive ever used
received in just a few days
small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practicesrehearses etc
not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there
i am very pleased with the quality of this stand
but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks
sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems
they improved the action considerably
just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice
this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received
packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require
so slick and last forever compared to standard strings
flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action
at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds
while a motu ultralite for mixing  tracking is plugged into the xlr connection
but as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better
i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string
it wont give you the brown sound
if it breaks ill post about it
they do not have any detectable noise or issues
cheap price and cheap product
took me about 15 hours
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp
as of now i hardly use them at all
i mean shouldnt it just immediately work
ive been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the 1980s
everything was good except for that one microphone
no fancy designs but a great value for the price
the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws
i dont think the cat would appreciate that
i really dont like this
very happy with these strings
the pedal itself is built like a rock
i love the pick attack with these
but all i bought it for was the purpose of tuning mission accomplished
wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this
both arrived together and at the expected delivery date
i bought this unit because my amp doesnt have reverb
you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volumewah pedals
i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to
my son was very happy with this guitar strap
shipping takes time but for the price who cares
if it does break has a lifetime warranty
such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz
this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones
ive been using this item for about 3 weeks now and i love it
nice as a tabletop effect
it felt like my guitar hung around my neck
the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate
youd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over
i have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable
b205d is a powerful speaker system
they are instead control picks
im planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case
and you get that rockstar feel throw picks at the audience
i think i could write a book here
this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment
can be used either sitting or standing
clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out
thought id try this but theres another brand that i prefer
the modulations and delreverbs are well done also
i always used another companys strings and avoided ernie ball strings
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week
or even headphones that youd like to baby
these strings are great for a 12 string
small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners
they offer good middle of the road accessories
uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter
two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes
i am a converted guitar player and i like playing with a pick
two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want
its been a while since last we got together
they are tough well made and simply work and sound great
i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain
one spot has become the standard
as you can tell by the title ive got another of these little babies
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board
its just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind
working just fine so far came quickly in the mail
if you understand what this is for i think its a great idea
i use the picks occasionally
it has the same 6 strings tuned the same way
i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly
i would also by the dunlop lemon oil as well
so especially for the lead guitarist this should be a major selling point
my old pair of jbl studio pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost
i love its size and portability
there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use
and i love this tuner
it is too long and will likely split your neck
no more extra messy cabling
works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect
one constant high pitched screeching tone
and nothing happened to it or the guitar
the wire could be a little heavier but you cant beat the value
but i got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap
im neutral on this one
it is my first pedal of any sort
awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life
so i heard these were good and ordered one to try
works with multiple straps as well
i have nothing to compare these too except my lee oskar
the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark
an easy item to recommend for the price paid
this amp probably is not for you
it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultraeasy to use
this is a great bargain too since its certainly not an expensive accessory
the standard 9v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun
this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan
like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele
it does a fine job
this capo was just perfect for my needs
or it could just be in my head
this guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money
first time ive spent over 25 bucks for headphones
i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room
it is user friendly and guitar friendly
has 6 stringsfrom e to e
just got it so far so good
you can tell when theyve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling
if you are a beatle fan this is such a cute item
it looks and feels so high quality
this thing is just sweet i just love it
i also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big
the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat2
the display is easy to read and easier to use
really quick to setup and use
many options settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile
all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last
changing strings on a 12 string less often
ive used my hde pickup for about a month now
these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords
some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics
amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do
a great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric
over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use
jcm800 in a 30 dollar box
the fit and finish seems like quality also
the build quality of the mic is excellent
great pedal very lush and usable tones
it has a sticker that says made in china
having these nyxls on there is just one more added benefit
the strings had a good feel to them as well
i highly recommend this guitar
i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck
i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid
must less expensive and just as good as others
dont last but a couple weeks
it does the job though
if your fret board is pretty dry do not remove the oil
the tc electronics ditto pedal will not disappoint
works great for changing guitar strings
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
use it all the time
hey jerks do you play guitar
i got the same tuning results on all of them
it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar
it is not expensive but the item is sort of cheap
its about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball
but why not round wounds
they could have done better on that end
it holds up the guitar
i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap
you really cant go wrong
i wasnt expecting much from the mic
you dont care about a telescoping boom and2
but this is the original and the best
its portable and runs on 4aa batteries
i like that its a bit larger than a 2021 soprano uke
if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly
441 khz and 16 bit sampling
i highly recommend this item
play with the round side for a fat tone
it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well
the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording
if it is not convenient it wont be used
i highly recommend this amp
but its not a distortion pedal its just an overdrive
i bought these strings to try on my guitars
behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass
hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal
knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones
strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with
the blue power light is blinding
its a really great quality stand for the price
but there was one thing wrong
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display
when you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic
i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line
the feel is different and the sound is different
this strap was great i was glad to find this well made wide strap
all in all id say the design of this is very user friendly
this one blows that one away
the display is very easy to read
i bought two sets 6 total great cables no added hum
might be a little to tight for checking intonation
their differences for your  ears
for the price paid is a very reasonable option
i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day
so when reviewers say its bright i say compared to what
the tones are warm and welcoming not as sharp as with other strings
not completely gone but lessened
great feel doesnt slip in sweaty fingers
the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well
the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar
every note will have the same volume
its thinner than i thought
and i love the tweed cover
hopefully this helps some who have posted questions
including many delays and echos
not a issue with manufacturer but dont drop it too hard
but they look great work great stay in tune and are completely vintage spec
the apogee jam cured all of that instantly
i dont mess with the noise gate so i cant really comment on that
if you buy this you really need to baby it
i personally think this seagull is over rated
i get long life and very good clarity from daddarios
it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case
nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated
i use daddario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics
i am using on a yamaha board
think of it as a supplumentary effect
lol the cord delivers good sound quality
grunge was ok but not my kind of style
get it one you will love it
pick up a used one
they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks
i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c1s
this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful
my other favorite is a dean electric 12 string
this 4oz bottle will go a long way
i am using this for my 112 amps
the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options
this new led version is built with less quality
i would recommend this capo
i have a significant volumegain reduction now
for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine
even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the 5th star
also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables
running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong
i installed these on my 2000ish epiphone les paul
used to tune with a tuning fork
the sound from this sg is true to its big brother from gibson
i dont know but i am satisfied with this purchase
i also tried two mxls
whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa
buy this guitar u wont be sorry you did
small enough to take along
the sound is very good
i especially liked the unreleased version of for your life
have been using these for years now
i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has
just buy it and move on
they dont sound overdriven they just sound distorted
for playing they sound pretty good
it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though
had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing
nice grip even more so when i sweat
its usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues
the first power source that is fun
it may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys
the real jewel in the crown tho is the instruction book
i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago
no noticeable hum at 34concert34 level
i have been needing one for a long time
flash forward  this thing kills
they last forever and have a great grip
one less thing to set up carry around and worry about
this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm57s
i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp
i just put this on my dot hollowbody
dont judge their products on price alone
it doesnt have a onoff switch but thats minor
a great price and a good item
the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem
updatetwo years in with continued regular use
4 stars because ive only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode
most of my recording lately has been done with various apple platforms
sounds amazing in any combo
instead its in a landfill
wipe them down with a little dr
highly recommend anything by d addario
ive bought 4 of these over the past couple of years
im in love with the dual design system
this cable is mono only ie not for stereo recording
yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of
ive now secured it with tape so it should be ok
tried this and was not happy
there are much better sounding metronomes out there
they are not too stiff or too flimsy
sound great play great feel great tune great
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great
no expensive pads to buy just use water
ive only used them once for backup vocals and the results were good
then i tried this recipe
im not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagonwheel
chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes
still a tight fit though since theres only 834 of wire
its a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle
but it should do the job
if you mic up this will work for small gigs
not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out
at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth
this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right
that aside these will greatly improve the way any set sounds
i wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference
it may just take practice
i cant believe the one they sent was so short
ordered 6 and out of 6 i have exactly zero flat washers
you do receive two other software options with the device
it seems sturdy and well built
some are better than others and this one works perfectly
the jacks are all metal
the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy
overall a very good product
great tone and tuning stability
it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name
i really am starting to love behringer
i figured id give the drops a try
this one is very adjustable and stays put
my disappointment is with the sound
think peavey 6505 eq structure
solid hardware side mount ac power
no assembly instructions were included in the packaging
i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option
fits mxl cube mics perfectly
daddario xl nickel woundregular light gauge exl110bright round wound
im sure it would be great on a dark stage
these sound good on my electrics
for the lower price you get black plastic
very well made  strong
but these microphones were a game changer for me
its made by monster cable
it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size
this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble
like most nickel strings do
ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment
these types of pedals are toys
its a fantastic little tuner
you get what you pay for
dont ask then why i got a sn6
the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play
ive been using the mxl990
anyway besides that they seem to be decent enough quality
the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension
i have to do this every time i turn on the computer
has anyone else noticed the me70 reviews out there arent too useful
it sounds good and seems to be very durable
this is a pop filter
thats probably a rare problem for the intended user
try different brands to find what suits you best
these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools
in sunlight its too dim
you cant easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues
even using a capo 100 recommended
fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them
i have not experienced the tonesuck or buzzing that others have complained about
my experience with this little tuner has been perfect
these strings sound great plug and unplugged
i will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp
after trying for a couple of hours i find that it wont do that
i got these for about 12 here on amazon
if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this aint it
these cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the usa
my daughter had a great time getting used to it
thus it is pretty short even when stretched out
it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs
easy to install strap locks
have not broken one yet
the same is true for every note
not at all what i expected for the money
the high strings will talk to you
with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar
i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes
i would look for something else if i didnt already have this
you cant go wrong here
good strap very comfortable and strong
id give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial
they arent bone brass wood pearl dont expect them to be
small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading
i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings
overall a decent playstarter uke and worth the 30
these strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers
in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat
dont force anything and you should be fine
other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine
now about the amp itself
better than i imagined even with all the good reviews
ive owned strats telecasters cheapies an alvarez i think
i only use this as a tube amp for vocal
i heard more definition with the guitar
fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for
this is the stand you remember from the band room
the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v22 peavey valveking etc
for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use
yes this is a great overdrive
the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic
you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed
that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well
im not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short
i definitely will be using this seller again
sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo
the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong
this is not how the world of music sounds
these hooks are padded and rotate a little
the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too
ive been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems
the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks
the normalmidcut switch is part of why its a great fuzz
i got a couple of these
also run the us600 after the distortion for optimum performance
i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars
but for practicing in your bedroom or similar its perfect
this one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap
and i have a ton
the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand
didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing
for the price this is one great little dynamo
its as well made as most i think
this guitar is good enough for any beginners
not quite delay not quite reverb
this beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my martin
there are a few issues however
the amplifier use three tubes  1x 12ax7 and 2x 6v6s
i bought this for my teen son for christmas
i cant recommend this product
quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their goto house mics
the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great
this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but its gone now
we are using an mp3 player for backup
be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes
these really arent a very good value
thats what makes them so much fun to play and modify
its so simple a child can use it
this is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp
the strings are nice and smooth and springy very easy to press on
these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost
leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap
not terrible but somehow chemical
hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last
so this was a birthday gift to myself
i was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size
cords are cords but these are very nice packaged great good deal instant turnaround
it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic
i made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress
these are great xlr cables
the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic
warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive
smooth reliable action and no noise too
with the different thicknesses i can choose which works best for me
okay so here is how i put it to the test
it also has a headphone jack
the sound from a 40 pedal is outstanding much better than i ever expected
i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments
im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard
i was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didnt
the snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable cardboard box
this mini telescoping boom is the bomb
its made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great
the builtin metronome doesnt have a lot of volume but its clearly visible
i bought this for a friend whos previous tuner was lost
the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package
these last long without compromising the tone
now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter
by far the best distortion pedal out there
this fender mini guitar stand works great
they are solid look good and feel good
cover them with a sheet or something
highly recommended for frequent string changes
the color is a a metallic blue almost navy
the base strings feel really strange when sliding
the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier
bought bass case for stratwanted extra space
i cant recommend these enough
someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid
when you turn it back on it usally works fine
adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect
very durable and light weight
it is not that large and really organizes my instruments
a good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks
the strings were easy to work with on installation
as an overdrive its great kind of a midsy marshally sound
get the batteries it did not came with any
coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years
i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer
well made and just what i was looking for
also i like it more than the jj but the difference is subtle
i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one
unfortunately they sent the wrong one but ill use it anyway
doesnt take a lot of space
when not in use i keep it parked on the headstock
ill still recommend this wedgie
nice to have the whole set again
its especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming
they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good
the enclosure is a smaller pedalboardfriendly size
he also bought one this morning
in life you mostly get what you pay for
another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software
i let him kick that pedal on and off all night
i would definitely recommend but its kind of expensive for what it is
like i stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality
i see they make a mahogany version i think du200
these are well worth the cost
i have had plenty of these
there are scores of chromatic tuners on the market
any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can
i have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them
they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china
but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone
nothing to complain about here 5 stars all the way
go ahead and buy it
but it doesnt work right so its like running with a flat tire
it is dead ballson accurate quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight
i dont think i would take it on an airline
sound is clear and crisp
rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7
i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs402b mini stand
seems a tad flimsy but time will tell
i recommend going with these
well i dont really know what else to say
for 120 you get virtually every effect in the book
works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help
i have tried many types of steel strings
perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier
the stand can be used with or without the upper brace
these headphones are kind of classics
i cant say its bad
its too narrow at 17 inches
other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss
it does whats its suppose to do
as just simply an amp it has more power  as good of sound
i like how it smells does that make me strange
the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time
it does have an internal dip switch
plugged straight into my bass amp for home recordingpractice
im very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat
this case however fits my dot custom like a glove
if youre in need of a side boom look no further
the old one had a lot of handling noise
it performs as it should and appears to be quite durable
it was set up well and has played well out of the box
i have spent a good month with my new guitar and i am impressed
nope but it has some tricks up its leave for the price
taylor logo makes it look good and official
those are the best ones anyway
this one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some ive tried
if you can afford it the peterson is the best clipon tuner out there
i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings
i paid for the entire system
the straps on this fender stay put  love it
i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic
never had any problems with them
ive bought three of these now and plan to buy more
if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive
would it be only a one trick pony
pros  works fastaccurate and can recognize full chromatic scale
i also received one without a battery which upset me at the time
this one was a huge disappointment
you will not be sorry
and  it doesnt come with any manuals to speak of
but it works fine never had any problems with it
modulation and delays rocks they sound good
ive bought quite a few tuners over the years
mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are
i debated between this one and the other popularslightly more expensive one
this is the perfect fit for all my basses
i use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner
we just need to be open to it
do not buy this piece of junk
my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot
the coated ones are medium which is too heavy for me
no problems with seller and product came quick
otherwise great case highly recommended
came with more parts than what were required
i just plug in and everything sounds magical
but on a budget this mic is amazing
they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in
good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes
seemingly no tone loss no added noise and no coloration
just dont ever drop it
medium is my personal choice  they did not disappoint me
when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me
the bright colors make them difficult to lose
bought six still have six a week later
id recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there
i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings
all adjustments keep position well
and whats up with the tuning thing
it kind of smells like motor oil
he clearly was good with an ebow
its a solid pedal that gets it done
the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds
ive owned this mic for 2 years if youre curious about durability
i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt soundhole cover
it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender
it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet
within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt2
arguing over tuning can really take up time
very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic
by comparison the boss psa120 adapter puts out 200ma
this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had
makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body
one channel 8 does 9v with 500ma sounds great right
the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch
that is not the case
one battery  this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other
they look great theyre easy to install and they work very well
i always play sitting so height is not a consideration for me
overall stays in place and does its job well
i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner
this pop filter is great
good construction and easy to put together
im sure ill buy more in the future
good price just as described
endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer
i bought these because they were an 34addon34 offer and im glad i did
intonation is spot on looks beautiful too
no more bendable problems i really love these extensions
first off im no ukulele expert
when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it
the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head
73 mm is right for me i really like them
just clip it on and jam out
my equipment is very secure
these are the best sounding in my book
the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more
but my effects boxes like to have separate 14 tr ins and outs
switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly
its more like a preamp
the pots look really good
the preamplifier has one 12ax7
hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands
i got way more than i bargained for
its a nice guitar for the money
kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point
i sprayed a little matteblack paint over the epiphone logo
samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website
i guess i dont like the way the uke sounds when using them
but find myself using this even more often
my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself
this is i think based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal
my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products
i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me
they have good sound quality
i installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay and it lasts forever
please fully check them out
but if you want something that is 90 close well this is it
the tuner works like a champ
but he loves it and i guess thats all that matters
i was turned on to this and i was truly blown away
best tuners you can buy
amazoncomgpproductb000ws1q4e direct box i purchased from amazon as well
and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup
they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine
no issues at all and they look good
that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy onoff
this makes it easy to copy to my pc and keep organized
that being said dont let that detract you from buying this
there are two ways guitar strings go bad
tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end
i bought this one after using the sn2 for 5 months
would i prefer something nicer if  werent an issue
be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however
so add 10 to get more than 30 minute in tune play here
it is an excellent backup capo
these picks were no different from picks without the 34gator grip34 imho
i always keep these around during string changes
because its such a sound platform to begin with pun intended
but im glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test
i used this with my samson mixer
does what it was intended to do
i play while im playing crazy 8s with my son
makes a great practice room amp
they hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out
it stays in tune and dont let the laminated top scare you its great
ive had fun with it
this little cable gets used on my practice amp
i was surprised at how small the jam is
so i ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter
the sound is short with a very high tone pitch
i cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up
i love this little item
this thing simply didnt work right out of the box
the red color is a metallic color  and i totally dig it
i also appreciate the even tension across the strings
it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob
meh these things are what they are
glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on
i use to use my sound card
and it required some dremelingsanding to get it to sit correctly
this fixed the chibson tuning issue
besides that ill more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers
i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose
the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward
update 6614 still the best pick ive ever played
it works nicely and for the price it was a steal
before you dive into the presets
the bonus is that its also one of the least expensive that ive seen
if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect
this bracket holds the ns micro tuner of which i have 3
i have a vintage 60s dixon hummingbird
i use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp
the sound is clear and warm on my yamaha and my martin
whatever engineer was in charge of this  you screwed up big time
the frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good
if i want better i would shop around and pay more
it holds all my acoustics perfectly
it is cheap so you should just get one
but lets quest after some serious bigleague sound
amazon should have clarified in their item description
these are high quality picks
if you get these and they arent perfect
not much else to say
the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons
you really cant go wrong for the price
its made me check out other audiotechnica products
i am now a believer
oh man do they sound nice
this is perfect love it
i still use this for practice at home
i just toss it in my gig bag and im always ready
i like this tuner as much as my sn8
its not for professional use
and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp
i needed a cheap mic stand that didnt break the bank
fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume
bought two of them about a year ago and im still happy with them
by the way bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one
i still cant believe how light it feels
it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet
seagull to me is overhyped
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips
i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack 802 that i had
this capo is worth the price
and this with that extra filter on it it blocks even more
these picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction
it also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etc
i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes
i bought some planetwaves cables for 40 that didnt even last me 2 years
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isnt very friendly
since purchasing them they still ring nicely
if you need a simple normallength strap this should work fine
you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned
instead its very edgy and smooth as can be
cord works well and hasnt been any problem to date
i will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it
best price and overall value compared to the name brands
these heavy gauge are the main strings i use
whatever i didnt like about them got drowned out when i tried electric
i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build
its lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory
i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker
and the tascam th02 keeps up
and the price is great
i read many negative reviews on several sites
but for me and the way i play
now the x2 is my main amp
they do sound good though and will last a long time
i bought this to try out on my baritone uke
the tuner works quickly and reliably
in the end the real difference was the price
when they say mini they mean it
overall  i like it
id prefer something more white
check out some youtube tests before buying
analog dry signal thru with digital delay
they are bright and feel really good on my hands
im happy with this pickup
very easy to install on the wall
what can you say about an adapter cord
these are manufactured on the cheap
you simply will not find a negative thing about the zt lunchbox anywhere
i was 2495 when i got it
and every student ive ever had has one on their guitar as well
my guitar i guess but who cares
i think tortex  delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by
it was like there was no pick
all in all im very pleased
first its all tube so it sounds really good
im not sure id use it for professional gigs but great for home use
i would really recommend not going to a retailer
its just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables
ive been using it for nearly a year now
this cuts strings with no problems
however ive been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca
this is essentially a toy
will i continue using the product
after owning it for several days the draw 2 hole went flat
he really likes it a lot
no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more
keep up the good work
they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick
i liked it from the very first tuning
i tweaked the action and the 010s are fine and ive made the adjustment
i really dislike the switch on this thing
im an irishstyle dadgad guitarist
those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat
still has some orange peel but not a lot
i will have to use an acoustic preamp
very lush and sweet to listen too
speak from experience ive tried a lot and did many research
this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while
all snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner
you really cant go wrong with this pamonitor
you can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh sounding
they sound great and stay in tune
thered is also an ab switch that is almost a tone mode
i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar
id be happy using this on a welltraveled pedalboard
order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring
thats like the only downside i can think of
so how do they sound
i cant say i love them or i hate them
first the pt2 and now the pro
however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely
it is easy to use
this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe
theyre functional durable and can be setup within just a few seconds
these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer
there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time
they arrived well packaged and not loose
but these do work really well
the effect is really great
no complaints on these strings
almost the same sound as the pyramids and a lot cheaper
each to their own i suppose
these were a very nice find
if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model
the shorter the cable the better for studio use
ive used shure sm58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968
this power supply is unbelieveble versatile
it worked but i dont use it anymore
do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument
it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs
if your experience is like mine youll be very satisfied
the display is nice and bright as well
the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing
fast fret  fast fingers
if you want to play metal youre going to need a distortionoverdrive pedal
i do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them
it assembles quickly and easily and folds up into a nice package for transport
thats my experience at least
i record at 48k  16bits in
as i strummed each string to sound was so clear
these are the only locks ill use now
i just finished putting them up and im completely satisfied with their solid construction
well executed black guitar strap
this is a great value
ive dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubberylike casing
awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer
i found a stud  it works  looks fine
great extra light polyweb strings for guitar
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
you just cannot be without one
after the guitar gets hydrated
well its size as i measured it is actually 12 inches by 1458 inches
most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker
that was years ago and i couldnt get rid of it fast enough
and to be quite honest ive only been using the presets
these guitar picks are just the best
very sturdy stand suitable for stage use
for this price 15 you simply cant go wrong
i will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables
for general use in doors its decent and for sure worth the price
some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking
so far forget to use it but that will come
works great stays out of the way
this is an original gibson gear replacement part
i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do
im an amateur musician so im on and off on playing
my son much prefers the elixir strings
would like to have a thinner one
they give off such a warm tone and are holding up very well
please please please please do research before you buy anything
it is heavy duty but also light
silent onoff and i have two of them
but they said they love it
super leather very well puttogether
its sturdy and gets the job done
i use this stand for a smaller 50 watt fender amp
probably ok for solo gigs or home practice
the guitar picks were exactly what i was looking for
they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them
is it a completely authentic acoustic sound
lucky this is a good option
they look good and perform well
cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele
for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super 250s
i have been running it with pro tools 9 since 2011
i bought 2 of the same ziotek extension cableat the recommendation of focusrite
good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones
folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal
this cable seems topnotch to me
so i took a chance on this little stompbox from china
quality seems ok but time will tell on durability
especially on the ml designed guitars
this string compares significantly to the proarte string
effects  there are 9 amp models ie 57 deluxe metal 2000 etc
i bought this eq pedal to use with a 70s amp project
but mine seems dead on
i recently purchased a epiphone eb3 bass and it didnt come with a casebag
notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock
i would buy from this company again and probally will in the future
it it anchored to my board
this is totally unnecessary for a footswitch
the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said
however there is a downside
this also provided a additiional 3434 separation from the wall
ive never heard worse strings
the footswitch action is smooth quiet and nearly effortless
this one for my new ovation 12 string cc245 is what i needed
seems very solid but its always difficult to tell with cables
it works on my acoustic bass electric and my mothers voice
it plays great  great fret job and solid tone
get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar
i like the spray bottle applicator
well not when itcomes to cables
great padding yet still lightweight
i would highly recommend this especially at the price
if youre a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing
i lose them before they wear out
just got this today and im experiencing serious install issues
i broke down and im glad i did
its great as a stand alone distortion running on a clean amp
add two monitors and youve got yourself a nice little pa
for the price this pedal is a good deal though
overall my favorite snark model and my favorite clipon tuner
i love for my practice rig
im very pleased with this purchase
proper use of a traditional nonlocking tuner is just as stable
at 8ohms i still get good volume
its decent sound and decent build quality for a good price
you can just leave the plate off if you want
i also have a boss gt100 multieffects unit
folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag
does what it is supposed to do
i have used gibson polishes for 38 years
the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture
i recommend this if youre in the market for one
they are still going strong
if youre looking for a creamy true bypass analog pedal then look no further
the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way
28 coiled plug end to plug end
for the price it does a very good job
switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm
for quiet practice youre best getting a vox amplug imho
you can compare both at guitar center
btw i am using this not on the cp series
second both straps were not adjustable to 5934
you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer
plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus
as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say
these balanced patch cables are great
until i switched them around
i play using this device
the 1 spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz
a very well built great sounding guitar
id buy this product again if i had it to do over again
one step on the cord and it came apart
they worked well and were easy to install
although i ordered three of them
even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well
this works exactly as intended and is a perfect size for my ms2000
they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time
some of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic
it sounds good on my guitar and its not that expensive
love it and have one in every case
there is also a model made specially for bass
calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red
and in that regard these are excellent strings
a lot of options available with this goodsounding pedal
this product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately
i have used it to hang a 12 heavy string
usb powered and plug and play
im very happy with the size of the sn1
yes its casing is plastic but quite sturdy
its flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable
if that isnt what you want then i would look elsewhere
back light on knobs shows clipping on volume green and red and connected green
neck and frets are straight level and do not snag
it just feels a little tight and crammed when i wear it
when i did this it completely shut out the hiss
also i read a review bout it not fitting some guys lp
its great for beginners or experts alike
however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip
they are very nice looking and functional too
this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band
i immediately bought a 2nd set for my small hafler speakers
you could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra
it just isnt a high end product5star perfect
im happy with the tascam us 100
this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price
almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials
it worked very well on violin too
you have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well
ive never owned something like this before so that was annoying
the stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string
i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great
but 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for me
it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet
this fits the bill perfectly
have not gigged with it as yet
switching to these was not a problem at all
the neck is perfectly finished and fast
intuitive and the backlit screen is so easy to see
i got it to have it if i needed it
although i should have just got the universal instrument tuner
when using the mxl 24 usb in win 7 no driver download is necessary
well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that
i swear by these strings
thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars
i like fender mediums always have but i gotta branch out man
never any complaints from me
otherwise the time machine works fine as described
hard to say it just indicates high  low  on pitch really
the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use
this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles
makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this
very heavy cord and top quality construction
nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght
its simply not sturdy enough physics or no
they last for a real long time
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable
this pedal works like a charm
this 2nd one im using to hang up my beats pros
great price but unfortunately this product didnt work for me
the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them
like i said i love these things
if youre considering buying this just do it
quality strings do sound different and nearly as importantly they feel good too
the tube screamer just works
i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot
the build quality is outstanding and its true bypass
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
no buzzing and crackling and no more wires
my american special strat came with 3 springs and now has the five
companies that dont test their products dont deserve your business
that gives this stand more value
fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing
was using a box and this is a great help
it also comes with a nice polishing cloth
volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear
it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin
this picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones
i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music
im quite pleased with this speaker
theyre great easytoread and easytouse tuners that are surprisingly cheap
can be quite sibilance prone so beware
but an arm on it and that could be a different story
this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out
i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off
for the moneyyou wont be disappointed
but i realized that im a music snob
definitely  going back for more
this multiplug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals
only thing make sure you read the description well
was using cheep pidmont blues harpstoys
i completely agree with 34jpfromoh34
you dont buy 15000 pickup for a 200300 instrument
i love this little tuner
not much distanceyou have to 34eat34 the micsbut the sound is great
someday i may use it on stage
but for average boards they work great
its a fine 34first34 guitar
they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand
want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay
gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick
buy a good sustain pedal
glue and a rubber band now holds it together
received these with lightining speed
it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe
thats not what it was designed to do
works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio
i cant really go back to normal sized picks now
its heavy weight solid construction and very stable
it works well and seems to be durable
if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure
despite that ive been highly impressed with its quality and sound
ducks ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case
its one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product
its not unbearable but if you can find an alternative its probably best
just barely gets the job done
they are also very durable for foam screens
but it may not hold up forever
ive seen reviews about this brand being noisy
the sm57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled
these may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny
overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone
the mic imo is fullyvalued even at its singledigit price
so you plug it and its ready to use
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
works great and love the colorful display
also theyre on the bottom end of the price range
tubulaarrrrholds my 8 string 6 string acoustic etc
pot lockwasher nut and cap are what is included
i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs
its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility
this is hands down the best delay pedal i have ever used
i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely
to my computer for mixing duties in reaper
i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike
i use the ns2 when i use my chain of pedals
i just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them
you dont have to hold it or put it on your leg
update   i just received another set of these cables
this is a very nice guitar strap in light gray
you may have to put something behind it or replace it
i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case
it can initially be a rather shocking experience
the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops
so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick
looks like it will last
that being said the pedal sounds great
its not fancy but it doesnt need to be
if it only came in mink it would be perfect
the tuner workss as advertised
it does everything the product description tells you about
id seen this one on youtube and thought its little bobble head looked
i got this for twenty bucks shipped
the other hardware isnt much better
this is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people
010s but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these
the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less
both mine measured 4534 from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended
i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz
sat on my snark  good tuner but takes some patience
its like having a loose connection inside the cable
they dont come with cables so be sure you have some available xlrxlr
with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from
i am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes
very easy to hit the wrong one
i dont even have that
good luck on your search i hope this review has helped
oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it
with the wall wart no di hum  great
exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money
the shure sm57 sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged
wow  they all come to life and make the amp sizzle
its all the same no squeak slick jazzer mellow in tone
so you are getting what they say
so testing on their own mics
they look great and work well
you can not go wrong with daddario strings
these cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else monster cable
you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right
its quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag
the product comes in a clam shell package
ive had fun with it
the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described
the generic ones installed were from 2010
this is a great strap
very convincing and just 40
good quality for the price its a mic on a stand
it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight
this is a very versatile tuner
this pedal got it 100 right with tone after a tube switch
thats something that should only happen once in your life if at all
i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour
it hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out
dont let the cheap price fool ya
the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pfft
the beams are narrow but you get two of them
small light and stays out of the way  it just works
i have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years
they will sound great for the life of the string
im thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin
the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it
just to make sure you have the proper humidity level
its tiny and doesnt look like a fisherprice product
not as much padding as i would like
it is identical in every way with the retail store product
it will pick up ambient noise from the front but thats to be expected
ill never go back to tuning by ear
this is very affordable too given the high number of effects it will supply
i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly
they were twice as loud as these
i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations
the storage compartment is nice and large
i mean they are not computer speakers or anything
some of the best aspects of the metal muff include 1
definitely try this before you buy it
and that one doesnt look like it will live very long
who cares so long as it sounds this good
no problems until i got to the g string then pop another breaker
i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased
i played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonationfret buzz etc
but it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient
again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well
ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it
quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well
that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius
use the cloth often to polish my guitar
these hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs
nothing gimmicky or faulty just perfect
this amp has tons of power to spare
it works well pretty good buy
a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily
plus it was made in the usa
fit perfect to my taylor t5 and no cons i can find so far
gls audio 25ft mic cable is very high quality
i like them a lot
easy to reach and nice to have on hand
and this thing is easy to use squeeze put on neck done
and respond great at any dynamic level
for 7 dollars its a really good deal
received them in four days
and high praise for godps music
the snark sn5 tuner for guitar bass and violin gives me spot on tuning
under 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from 2050
it has no trouble amplifying a turntables signal to line level
tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my sg
the supplied mini usb cable fits nice and snug
i own many tuners and clip ons of many other brands
strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost
for now ill stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb
i play guitar and ukulele
then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over
it takes some skill to eq things to the point of normalcy
otherwise  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap
but very happy just wish had sometype of order
i bought the special 20 pro packkeys ga  c
a little careful sandingpolishing and the guitar was ready to play
they offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings
this bag was nicer than i expected for the price
high quality product and very easy to install
if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs6
i mix and master all my own music on these guys
its well built enough to stand up to regular use
i may end up gluing it in place
other than that your can change amount of distortion
so i ended up returning it the next day
these pedals last forever and i only paid 20 for mine
its has a cool analogvintage sound of chours
there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use
dunlop provided an inexpensive winder thats durable
well built and solid stand
this issue is why four starts rather than five
it now rest at bottom of a box
but you cant expect to just plug it in and go
it may not be a 5star intrument but its a 5star value
think lightning crashes by the band live
they were cheap and the build quality is fine
overall i am very pleased and saved time on string changes
i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings
easy to use easy to read and has options that i dont even use
these work much better than standard stamped trees
i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack
super easy to use and a musthave for anybody who gigs out
when playing an electric 34bodyless34 violin that hurts the collar bone
it works well with several different instruments that i have
you can get these in 24 packs at
but these were trashed in a month
last week 4813 one of them wouldnt power up all the way
if there was a way to give 10 stars i would
it can hold the weight of any of my guitars
i was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance
just a warning to those that are picky
this is a great little tuner and i am glad i bought it
i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends
the buckle doesnt seem to bother me
seems very durable switch and jacks are quality
they really help me out and they are a cheap price
its getting easier with these
to me they just sound complete
it holds well when bumped or moved
feels comfortable to wear also
would need a heavier base for use with a boom
ive had this set for about a month and a half
as with any other boss pedals its well made and reliable
i like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with
it has a good ring to it
i dont forsee having any problems with it
its springloaded so it comes back up by itself
these picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick
you could also leave it attached to your camera
1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10
this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming
you can use a capo with this instrument
this is my 6th joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint
over all a nice product
definitely top notch if this is what you are after though
the dura picks have more variety theres only one in each thickness
also my pitch harmonics better known as squealies come out clearer to me
its extremely sensitive slightly more so than the snowflake
yes they are made in china now
i love the fit and the sound quality
i switched to these and havent broke a string since
but the price is right and the stand is solid enough
the ucg102 runs on an asio driver
this capo cannot work with it
i bought this to replace an actual fullout pa and was very pleasantly surprised
a good old standard that ive used since i was a kid
you cannot even get a backpack for this price
some of them had the white dot some didnt therefore they didnt look uniform
keep it up technology gurus
nice solid no frills guitar strap
this is a good budget uke
recommmended if you dont mind a molded cable
the metronome has a flashing light too
with the xtra heavy picks i was losing what little treble these strings had
since then ive tried various sizes and brands  dunlop planet waves etc
this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound
generally dampits can be used over and over for years
this string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body
the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele
why bother sending it back
looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand
still these are nice picks
considerably less feedback 62 this was actually the primary reason i decided to upgrade
we did notice a scent but it didnt bother anyone
ok quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic
it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined
thanks behringer this is a great value
overall i can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at
these cables are good xlr noisefree cables
a day doesnt go by where the stand is not in use
other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money
there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range
34  how do you know if you have this finish
if youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect
i bought these because i wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming
call me old school i hate the packaging
a must have for any blues player
still its an ok product
if you cant find a container and add your own sponge then buy this
some electric bassists still do this
the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material
some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has
they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required
id rather lose one of these behringers than a 58
not for real heavy usage anyway
easy to hold and very soft
and im rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar
my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick
this is the only reason i gave them four stars
it also powers everything else and looks fine doing it
holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get
i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one
if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley 4 knob
no mud clear mids and highs with clashing
the board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles
part number  83cb made in usa
just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery
i applied a lot of force to pull the cord out
the springs in the back keep it back
to the less and also most expensive strings
the right pick is a personal preference
the classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp
i think so as well but i cant quite quantify it
i thought i had chosen a different capo
the prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument
i still prefer these 100 over other strings though
i didnt run it without this power source that seems too ghetto
really nice piece of equipment for a small price
the price went up nearly 50 on them though
i am very pleased with it
anyway this thing sounds great
not the best but not the worst
if your looking for crap that doesnt work
five stars for performance take away one for greed
it is exactly what you need in a capo
tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again
the display is bright and clear
overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great
just works so what else more can i say
the action is nice and low good especially for a beginner
maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying
i bought this because someone told me they really liked it
not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand
i can do a string changeover in about 15 minutes on a bad day
sometimes they break but what pick light pick doesnt unless its nylon
ive been thoroughly impressed with this pedal
2 the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged
it is pretty comfortable to wear also
i wish its built with switch onoffrecomend to buyer
gonna have to send this back
ive had no problems with the ones ive bought
boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet
i have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet
every one that ive used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly
it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios
toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc
no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness
louder than my friends 60w
even as i learn the notes on the guitar fretboard
pedaltrain makes a great pedal board
there are no frills and theres no latency
for the price its a really good deal
the feedback can be to to many other issues
but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the twoband eq
i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop
footswitch includes channel and boost buttons
saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome
it works on steel strings
it polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new
the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it
bought verbzilla digitech rv7 and the verbzillas ripoff   behringer rv600
yea how could a music stand be amazing
this strap button works great
the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories
the ends seem to be well made
it takes some practice and patience
this is a good buy
but its still fun to use
adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some
i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes
the bm might work better with solid state
thats on me this is a good product for what it does
im an abhorrent violinist but i teach mariachi band to elementary school students
i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges
it has a midsweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone
so be aware of that
if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired
you will not be disappointed
the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too
i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts
im really sick of these amazon substitutions
i ordered it and applied it
although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars
reading the product description may give you an idea about this product
often we get what we pay for
this one matches the acousticelectric i bought perfectly
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50150 and more
i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul
intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot
and a hint  some pedals like behringer have a rubber bottom
this is mainly a matter of personal preference
for 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion
this is the least expensive holder i could find nov 2013
they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing
the pockets are packed with books tools and strings
if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string
the yeti has it all in one package
i dont have any problem with this stand at all
i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole
recommended if you wantneed a nice little bag of fender mediums
you cant go wrong with these guys
i play harp with some some that i perform
newer models seem a bit beefier
we love having it around
for the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion
still love it but not to a 5 star level
i definately helps cut down 34wind whistle34 on my mic
they seem more durable than other brands
better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen
i burn through one or two cm100l per semester
i didnt expect this much volume from light strings
this seemed to be the best choice for me
for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
ive never had any issues with this
automatic  shutoff helps too
needed new strings but everything else was smooth
you can get a 25 cable for under 5 also here on amazon
the 2i2 is a simple setup
modified is more scooped saturated
i have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes
cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications
peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners
not a big deal but worth mention
was transferred to a dept
there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal
i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led
its quality outweighs its price
it should work very well with any size acoustic guitar
beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle
it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great
i put it down and didnt use it for quite some time
other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends
34quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations
a quality tuner for a low price
the focus knob is interesting  it doesnt act exactly like a tone knob
took no more than 10 minutes to install
i bought the wrong gauge
i put a set on my strat and tele
feels nice and is very light
always getting the question34can i hook my keyboard into your sound board34
quick snap on and off
needed these accessories to match a brand new fender pick guard
dont botherit doesnt mute the strings at all
i bought this pedal for the compression and sustain though and am very pleased
very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment
when i am plugged in i dont move around a lot
he has been getting less callous on his fingers
easy to install these buttons on the guitar
they will last forever if you take care of them
kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping
im so glad i was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago
also was the last to pick it up for 11850 shipped to my door
only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline
i paired them with the jj kt88s and these things just rock
does what it is supposed to do
i cant say much about this product
they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout
im not complaining i just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups
if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub
these babies are dead quiet
this amp is well worth the price
if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately
behringer all the way you can keep your expensive boss pedals
i got and agreethis works better
or the picture is a bit misleading
its only got a basic feature set but thats all i need
works great as a stand for the elec
the clean side of the amp is exactly that  very very clean
thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster
fighting stubborn leather openings especially if new
if looking for that oriental sound this is it
the larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath
you will not regret this purchase
they are just faster and easier
this is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players
great value for the money
never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for 20
easy to use and accurate
spend the extra few bucks on these and smile
tried them and he was right
these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm5758 series form factor
very easy to use and lots of extra cable length
both ended up in checked luggage
i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it
grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year
update december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider
works perfectly for the purpose
these are great patch cables especially for the price
traditionally the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings
not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap itll do
this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right
i got two of them
5 stars to amazons return policy thouh
this is a very nice guitar the finish and construction is high quality
first the material that the neck rests in is very soft
i bought these to fill the dunlop 5005 pick holder that i also purchasd
when i got the strap i was impressed
good price came quickly through prime
this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand
the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesnt alter your tone
you may wat to reconsider buying any filter
ive tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer
the neck support cup goes through that hole
with priceassortment in mind i give 5 stars
assembling is simple and fast
for the price it is a good deal
anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape
as you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine
so dont buy it expecting overdrive
i love these clipon tuners
very clean quiet and durable
theyre one of my very favorite effects honestly
the tone has continually improved as ive broken in the speaker
he said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great
like any other tool it doesnt always fit or please everybody
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
i put my kvm switch on it and other server components
and i like the durability it seems like it will have
i am happy with it
the distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy
the second one arrived with a low battery
i say go for it
the connectors are well fitted
these are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables
running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly
these kind of clips can break
worth a shot if youre on a budget like me
this strap looks better in person than on the computer
10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower
the streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical
i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother
makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one
ive used it to record my garage band shows
well that is beyond me
it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder  adapter
i recommend this mixer for your home studio
do you want to play master of puppets by metallica
it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add
this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard
it even comes with a handy pick holder
it took a long time to come
i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s
im not ashamed of having chinese clones on my board
plus nothing could beat its price so get it
just click the buy it button
no more slipping out of tune
other than the radio part
i love these little guitar stands
i also bought a pack of half wound 11s to try
then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me
im a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only
does exactly what you want it to do
cables are working really well for me
they are about equal on volume
still i think is a good tool to have
this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner
but that means the guitar is very secure so i am very happy
ive also heard of very very short battery life
the samson is the more delicate and refined of the two
big win for the guitar though
overall great strings and pretty consistent
this is a great tremolo pedal
it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear
some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges
the metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable
this stand is worth 1000 tops
i have been using them for 10 years and have never seen one fail
i will stay on with the exp16 right now
i agree with all the other reviews
the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it
heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played
this thing is a beauty
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
i have yet to decode their colors or naming system
the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy
everything else in the other 9volt 100ma slots
i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating
planet waves signature guitar picks  always the best always reliable
bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1
they fit in the factory hole without a problem
theres no buzzing and it stays out of my way when im playing
however the sd1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility
these work just like you want them to
been playing for 30 years and i have used tube screamers extensively
wish they would hold a couple more
the hall setting is wonderful
so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal
coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles
for the price you cannot go wrong with this
when they say fits soundholes from 3375  35 they really mean it
i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay
it sounds great for recording
they work perfectly and havent failed me once
i reach for these first
this was a low price and high quality solution
if you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle
not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords
i dont own a strat so i cant comment on single coils through it
my fretboard hasnt been cleanedoiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry
overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand
since the mic has a built in interface you cant use any other
at home or at a night gig its fine
this was my 1st decent classical guitar
this was recommended and i am happy with the product
paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal
for 30 bucks this mic is great
not expecting much i adjusted the tension
for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need
ive got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years
easy to use what more could you want
the best replacement for fender tuners by far
its not so 34digital and bright34 delay like boss dd3 or dd7
for some reason this one just doesnt hit the notes right
i then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended
with large fingers like mine it almost disappears
is a microthin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string
this pedal gets me there on the cheap
i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it
be careful out there people
thats just not what it was intended to do
the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile
if youre toating between practice with an instructor its okay
why do i go through all that you ask
i arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly
yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not
the highs were clean and bright
seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far
once locked theyre not going anywhere
this is clearly a case of 34your mileage may vary
if it had sturdier wall mounts id give it 5 stars
i love em use them daily and rely on them
this is really a great amp for the price
piece of cake if u practice
great find well worth the purchase price
look it up on youtube
sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent
works well and has good sound
but the bx5 performs we well or better than i hoped
good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall
all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups
do you even remember why you picked the style you use
the tripod base has been very steady so far
an allaround solid purchase for the low price i found on amazon
but i did buy this for rock band
not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot
this is a heavy duty strap
to be clear  tube amps sound like tube amps
i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks
the adjustable parts are easy to use
i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem
it gets the job done easily and very fast
they also dont distort out side sound
they are also very accurate i hear things just the way they are recorded
im satisfied with these picks
i also other boss distortion pedals
fender medium my favorite guitar pick a dozen should last a while right
only time will tell how well the soldering is
this stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle
this microphone stand it a fairly good buy
i didnt need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed
i have a ceramic and this steel slide
im having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings
i even recently bought a 2nd just because
id use it for lightweight guitars
i recommend this to anyone who records at home
only drawback  there is no volume control on the instrument itself
duh i should have thought about this it makes perfect sense in retrospect
honestly to protect this better theyd have had to contact tony stark
the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence
i dont plan on hammering my acoustic anyway
i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets
for me i prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric probably a
a great buy as the price was perfect as well
the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music
other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily
wanted it just on looks alone
the heavy bottons 32 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone
i like onstage and own several of their products
it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amplike
nice to use to muse your violin
welldesigned and reliable i highly recommend these
if you need to polish your guitar look no further
to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way
as ive said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing
i will preface this review by saying that i am no 34audiophile34
there is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too
highly recommended for those playing bluesfunkrock
despite the blemish episode it fits her perfectly
nice strap but a bit too stiff
it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen
all you need is a 10mm socket and your are set
its just a plastic clip and anything can fail
i put it on when necessary on gig breaks
for a few bucks more ill stick with schallers
this bottle will probably last me 10 years
i just cant trust it
please dont listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldnt keep tune
this is a greatsounding reverb pedal
it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it
i tested the microphone on a phone call using google voice
they were buttersmooth and great for flat picking
propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar
i think everyone has used fender mediums at some point these are no different
true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo
edit  apparently this thing fluctuates between 2030
i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint
its inexpensive and the padding is excellent
and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag
the sound quality isnt the greatest but thats to be expected
if you can you should try on holders before you buy
its very easy to use and rugged
they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are
for the price this mic is a very good deal
i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity
i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less
small 34thumbs up34 to amazon
im sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well
these have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern
that wasnt the case with the first model
one thing i didnt like was having reaper pushed on me
the keys were of course inside the case
i have no clue im an amateur
still its the best around
the brightest tone normal lifespan fair prices and louder than the rest
these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar
the polish in the bottle works well and the lintfree cloth works well too
ive switched over to this design and couldnt be happier with it
its easy to use and it overdubs
i dont use any of the other features
a cheap guitar doesnt always mean a pos
upon comparing the resulting  cds
daddarios last a long time for me and they sound good
live up to expectations and is comfortable
the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths
these are fantastic and unique guitar picks
i must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too
the volume knobs are handy for sure
i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly
this one is pretty decent especially at the price point
the cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines
that was good enough to sell me
c level control provide from ve to high ve boost
very analog sounding not digital
sell your sm57s for 60 and turn them into two of these
a real needed item is you play in darker rooms
but maybe its just my small kidlike hands
cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it
thought id give it a try
i would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
not sure i would buy these again
this chorus is just about right
the other cleaners and polishes are great too
not all picks are made the same  some are far better than others
excellent sound quality much better than any other mic ive used
and with 24 minutes of looping time thats just crazy for the price
they look good as well and they are easily adjustable
never owned an ocd but i dont need to
i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well
great as a primary or backup cable
so when my strings wear out i got this
which means it does what it was designed to do
in comes the planet waves
i wouldnt want it to be my everyday acoustic tone though
great product and great value
the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order
this one sticks well to the guitar
this may not be so great for smaller amps
needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application
i use it put mh guitar and harp mic through the same rig
this is totally different its the real thing
it is really the best pick holder i ever had
make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance
the sound quality is also very decent
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length
you wont be disappointed it is worth the price
a great value for your money
it does what its supposed to that other capos dont do
this should be every bassistguitarists best friend
the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6
so i just got this product havent used it
great sensitivity and i love the metronome built in it as well
finally it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch
others may prefer a different sound
okay but i have a pickup want the mellower tone sans finger noise
just didnt have the tone and bite i was expecting
its not fancy but its well though out and you cant beat the value
bass into one channel ipod into another headphones out
ever since i just bring a bass and this pedal
just dont get water on the wood
i would buy it again if required
its a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases
i love the product and all the features for the price
this item really speaks for itself
these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them
are just about all the same
its strong and durable and well designed
not ready to take the plunge
a word to best describe it
500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter
fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp
all and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference
for 50 you literally cant go wrong
wow for the size this is amazing
the g7th performance capo is priceless
but this is going to change all that
im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back
this cable seems like it will last me for a while
i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened
id order again if i needed another one
wish that it had a onoff switch but you can get around that
chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out
first i love these picks and used them exclusively for years
just good ol genuine fender parts
as expected from hosa another great product
i like a rich tone with some high end but without too much 8216klang8217
the hootenany style is sweeeet
for an in expense product
reed plate replacements are about 19
certainly worth every penny you pay for them
the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita
it is a decent cable
this is one beefy string winder
gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist
these fender qr knobs came in and looked good on my schecter
also does make the neck a lot smoother
the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length
i can see my reflection perfectly clear
one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp
in case you were wondering this is a clone of the boss compressorsustainer
count each chord as 123  456
my uke is very cozy inside
