will definitely make any uke sound great
still its the best around
wanted a way to plug in my boss me70 to save on batteries
easy to use wipe on and wipe off
there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too
overall i think this unit is a great value for the money
built well sounds good and does what youd expect
use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp
this pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans
very comfortable and looks great too
however a standard 2 driver is too big to fit into the strapbuttons
great sensitivity and i love the metronome built in it as well
you can barely tell its there from the front
the edges did not catch completely  and it looks terrible
pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this
this amp is cool and unique
the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too
and this is my favorite victim
i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing
no buildup or residue on your fingers either
the strings are true to elixirs quality and tone
sorta disappointed with it over all
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand
that low cost is obvious
not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
most other recorders in this price range dont have xlr inputs
just well made and functional
i have an alvarez yari acoustic guitar that i absolutely love
so this cant go in several outoftheway places i had hoped would work
thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars
it has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp
so i had to order a clip later
not only that but they sound great
my last comment is in regards to the h4n as a usb interface
very good for light portable set ups
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
ive owned them for a few months now
over the years ive tried several different brands of string
the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended
just ups the value even further
its like a hard plastic not metal like most are
im very happy with the purchase
and you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hours
there are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the windows handles sound
the behringer u control gives me stereo now
i feel like they should name it the 34pedal porch34
one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use
i have however had a slight issue with certain d strings
good luck on your search i hope this review has helped
first its construction is pretty light weight
the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure
ive found a new favorite pick
it works great not much i can say beyond that
love the sound and playability and durability
measuring for fit and specifications is on the money
i got the gold and its goodlooking without being garish
come on tascam you can do better than this
zzounds musicians friend sweetwater music 123 dont buy from them
ive been using it for nearly a year now
i know its a copy of other speakeramps
im glad i bought this
the base for this thing is a monster
they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive
for the price i think its hard to get any better than this
for that 5 stars easy
i really wanted this to work but it doesnt
we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired
10 ft is nice for home
oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech
thank you godps for making such good quality products
im now a convert too
i want them to last longer
i love the elixir strings
every guitar player should own this tool
not a lot of bass
thought about buying the expensive g7th capo but im very glad i didnt
holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you
easy to adjust and holds the ipad secure
if youve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one
i found that quality nice when dealing with
since then ive tried various sizes and brands  dunlop planet waves etc
should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it
i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle  nice
no need to find a special driver either
not noisy at all really clean pedal for your board
all strings must be kept clean if you want them to last
order this with eyes closed
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility
it pretty much takes over your entire sound system
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day
so i tried these and they seem to hold up better
heres the deal with this pedal
as for quality it has an unconditional guarantee see above
i used them with my harbinger ha60 pa system and i was not disappointed
they sound great and last forever
low action and stays in tune for days
my bassplaying has gone on for 50 years
amps are pushing itplus a gig bag and school back pack
those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work
its a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing
strap is quite stiff but id say its worth the price
i use alot of the other ones as well
another winner from planet waves
gls continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
it also seem tightly put together at the ends
long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable
i like how it smells does that make me strange
used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase
the quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch
this pedal is for metal
the med is pretty stiff
easy installation and nice natural sound
simply a nice assortment of picks to try
i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these
the mounting process was simple
for the price this does everything and more
bought this distortion pedal for our son
they are extremely well manufactured they look great and are sturdy as heck
the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier
for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super 250s
the capo does what its does
ieutf8qid1357264576sr81keywordsstraplockwhich seem a lot better and more sturdy
no frills just a simple concept that works
another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats
good quality cable with a good price
folds up and can easily be stored
they are made in  the usa and they use recycled packaging
finish playing slide your pick into this and its there when you play again
now its become a permanent member of the front of my desk
it can be confusing during the first time i used it
the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too
for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use
i folds down to a very small size but is quite strong
compliments my bwb pickgaurd nicely
i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars
can i hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones
ive not yet had a broken string with them
have had one for years
very happy with this purchase
this one was hard to read
its heavy but it in a good way
liked this capo it worked fine
so i cant comment about them
but as a backup stand i wouldnt hesitate
play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick
years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap
the question was 34did it meet your expectations
they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands
btw i am using this not on the cp series
runs on one cr 2032 pancake batteryincluded
so you plug it and its ready to use
they work just fine for a starter
i get everything on amazon now
anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane
open cap rub across strings a few times
comes with big beefy drywall anchors and feels just right
i have issued the refund of 704
this amp ranks up there with the best of them
500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter
lets say you use an xt or a x3
i would perfectly tune the guitar with the snark and then apply the capo
its light sensitive and looks professional
thus it is pretty short even when stretched out
this stand is small compact and sturdy
once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results
this does not turn off when i do that
i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut
which is why im buying another half dozen
this is a pretty strong cable
were not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitar
no problems at all with this product
i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend
all i can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing
its a very cute little capo
for years i have fell more and more in love with my yamaha cgx111sc
ive been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks
i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these
ive two of these stands
i thought it was awesome until i learned better
this guy not so much
one size doesnt always fit all
im opting for the convenience of the size
you can not go go with a set or two of elixers
i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand
compared to my g7th which costs 3 times more it is a great buy
it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal youll need
i run it through a baggs paraacoustic preamp or my fishman aura
bought roughly 5 of these
i would really recommend not going to a retailer
plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action
i was really surprised at the snark sn5 tuner
onehand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner
i would not do that without this straplok
so load the picks up
the plugin accessory is great and my pedal board has an outlet
as a musician im in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner
allinall its a good strap for the money which wasnt much
the are strong durable and sound good
a great value for the money
it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful
and the ultimate drive does it nicely
and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use
i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had
for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use
this pedal works like a charm
a quality pedal that should hold up well
they withstand a lot of play and i dont have to replace them often
it is definitely worth it
double dog dare ya to do better
simply outstanding simply the best
it works great to hang a standard size guitar on
it could be used on just about any instrument
im glad i chose them as they play easily and have a nice sound
cant beat it for the price
but then i remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and i thought okay
this is the right one
to me it wasnt even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs
no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidlymounted
the strings had a good feel to them as well
i love all the options you get with this pedal
this cable works fine for my needs right now
upgrade it to something better
fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp
i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less
it comes apart quite easily
right out of the box the hd 500 totally blew me away
fourth plays nice with computers
its best on a stand 34 feet off the ground
its fairly tough but flexible
these are excellent guitar picks
itll keep me busy for a long time
sure you can spend more on a slide but i see no reason to
i dont really know if its better than other brands or not
they were perfect for my pedal board
this is one of the quietest mixers ive ever used
folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag
also i couldnt see any effect between engagingdisengaging the tone button
however i dont like the plastic end pieces
doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo
it simply works well for the price paid
plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag
with proper care im confident these cables will last a very long time
its quick its accurate and it just works
but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses
dark grey letters on a light grey screen
if you mic up this will work for small gigs
the boss ac3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
im hooked to bronze strings
battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it
if not then ill update this review if i can
does the job and does it well
adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter
the pick extends out from the rubber shell
i also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend
for what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of you cant beat it
i have use this tuner for quite a few years
the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing
clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar
i find it handy useful and i recommend it
the string are easy to play and sound great
getting used to the attachment
nice pics that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
i installed this in two minutes
maybe i will try it again at some point but
it leads me to playing for longer periods
use them on all makes and no complaints todate
with practice i think this could improve
the cheap china copies on ebay dont fit
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs
so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio
its like playing a silk guitar
it looked great and felt solid
i have been needing one for a long time
they are made by taylor and all taylor guitars come with elixir strings
this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish
i did blues metal country and pop
i have several capos  this one really surprised me for the price
i bought this stand after trying two others that didnt work well
i record to daw and the recordings sound fine
and is just the best and simplest design
got it for 500 bucks and wish id bought about 5 more
love the sound it produces
it feels safe and secure
i would do business with them again
the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate
fat thick smooth and saturated
dont botherit doesnt mute the strings at all
the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that
i really like the fitfeel of this plucking pick
all workand the distortion control
i found running leads  scales with this pick to be a delight
jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable
i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
the mini tone master delivers well
this is an absolutely wonderful recorder
the quality of it is above my expectations
the pick pack contains 24 picks
the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth
does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar
thats a lot cheaper than spending twentysomething dollars on an additional wall wart
it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet
fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky
or at least i think so
by comparison the boss psa120 adapter puts out 200ma
this is just what the doctor ordered
i missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered
otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb
the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual
surprised me because its a largetoothed zipper
issues not only continued but worsened
there is no difference in the sound at all
i use it as a pa for practicing and it is a godsend
this is what it is
it would be more suited to home or hobby use
that will do metal this may not be for you
i would think it would work even better with a mic
works plugged in or unplugged
an inexpensive mode that looks and works great
first it tunes very accurately
the neck feels silky smooth
this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension
but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with
with interior pocket to put your accesories like capo string winder etc
the interior was nothing special either
theres really nothing i can add to whats already been said about this tuner
all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra
i use there 100 30 and 25 cords and have never been disappointed
the cords arent very long
i will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly
but jameson guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price
it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound
came with more screws than i needed
it is user friendly and guitar friendly
over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use
they sound clear and bright and they last a good while
these may be my new favorite bass strings
it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved
too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever
i will get another for my monitor
i have used coins and washers at times
however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy
always looking for reasonable pricing
also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing
this stand is worth the extra money over those 15 disasters
with the different thicknesses i can choose which works best for me
in addition i couldnt use those on my acoustics
treat the light like it has no bag and youll be fine
feels like its built to last
but it might have if i had not broken its fall
i have become a fan of gls
did a ton of research out there b4 i bought this
well you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar
i still like the pt2 much better
this is a must have item in my opinion
plus ill get another one in a different color
one final note  these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage
this is my new favorite rock pick
other than that when you need 1032 rack screws these are the real mccoy
a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life
they keep you guitar safe from falling
the bag has removable backstraps for carrying ease
for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand
you can set it to sustain for days
wow im really impressed with this tuner
it fails to sound right
it holds a mic just fine
if you want sm58s you need to buy sm58s
leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button
been a fan of these for years now
goes through 9v batteries quickly so stock up
i hate minimum word review requirements
this is very inexpensive and works great for my homewanna be purposes
i really am starting to love behringer
this brush is sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest and thorens
this is certainly your metallica amp
is it worth the money
easy to reach and nice to have on hand
otherwise these are a good value with easy on  off
another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists
i couldnt say that i loved it
or they begin their rave review with for a 150 amp
one spots come with an 8pedal multi plug
nothing at all fancy about this strap
it is more than i hoped for
the price is really good
but these for the price work fine
you cant go wrong with the ts808
its also great for vocals as well
they have been around a long time and hold up well with time
one volume knob one tone and one distortion knob
this little amp packs tons of tone  sound
good strong spring and good strong materials
for me the guitar is not an everyday instrument
it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised
all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on
this guitar is wonderful and sounds great
the bag is well padded and not to expensive
this is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface
its tiny and doesnt look like a fisherprice product
i like the choruslike mod button
trying out a few new types of picks and different weights
its got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too
its ok but not the best fog machine out there
the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus
but finally you get over that but seriously its huge
i use this one spot adapter with the 5 pedal attachment
my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny
this is fun and easy to do
for the money i doubt you can beat these microphones
this unit sounds good and is adjustable
this is a great pedal
i have never understood why yamaha keyboards dont come with a power supply
its just a little bit short for my taste
the fenders straps are great
in life you mostly get what you pay for
i love my laptop a thinkpad t40
two pieces easy to set up in seconds
for my first gig bag its ok
while this is not a 300 tape delay
ive heard the boss verbs
the travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself
could i play faster with them
so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar
the contrast helps you see what your doing
my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect
i am an older person who has old eyes
the destortion works well enough
one of those duh things i didnt even think of until just now
quite sure its the same model
think of it as an affordable boutique amp
the right pick is a personal preference
these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work
being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either
it also has a headphone jack
not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips
well thats not quite true
i would certainly not tour with it
011 gauge daddarios are good strings at a good price
you can move from string to string quick
anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws
it is small easy to read and use
yeah im the only one that sees that problem
the welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job
a w e s o m e
thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review
compared to my old cable the mogami gold produced a more transparent sound
if you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more
other than that i totally recommend this microphone
solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise
they worked well and were easy to install
its a great and inexpensive looper
you should buy those too theyre great
i use it with boss and ibanez pedals and it works great
its not just a uke tuner
ive been using daddario xl nickel wounds on my pbass for a long time
i bought these lightpicks because of the price
this music stand is og great quality and of a great price
great stand durable folds down nicely and really does the job
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them
i use it with a fender frontman amp
the build quality over the pod x3 live has improved
just gotta love that vibe
maybe a preamp would have helped
havent used this one yet
works great in extremely loud environments
as far as cq goes these are great no problems feel great sound great
you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects
hey now youre eric clapton
you cant miss with this product
fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks
it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m54 regal conductors music standquite well by itself
it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes
recently i was building a telecaster project
this is a great tuner
this is a cool gadget
i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering
not perfect but pretty god
it does not come with a mic clip
first of all dont expect any new tuner to work as a dropin replacement
this wah pedal just doesnt cut it
this made me take a second look at schaller
also i believe the very best value for the dollar
five stars without a doubt
its such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends
a plugandplay usb device with both input and output audio jacks
helps keep the products profile down a bit
the pictures are uploaded on this product page
we had a birthday jam at a friends house
i put these on a dual humbucker usa strat
the 7000 model does the same and doesnt take as much space
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg
the handle isnt going anywhere
its amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electroacoustic guitar
bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding
it has no problem with the low e string
if not just buy a cheap about 6 adapter like i did
ive been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now
the jacks are all metal
the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use
the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly
and not waste of money or an unwanted item
also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends
i used it a few times
however the sd1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility
they really help me out and they are a cheap price
i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks
my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust
no more bendable problems i really love these extensions
this is my 2nd or 3rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far
guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now
yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like seagulls
the clean tones are nice and warm
my acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand
these were filler items for a much larger purachse
i dont ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are
the h4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable
the microphone works without it
for speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model
i use this pedal mainly for the 34church34 setting in ambient volume swells
i dont know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached
a good buy well worth the price
if youre looking for a budget increase of tone
find something you truly love and buy that
i have a friend who also experienced the same problem
since ive had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it
i couldnt be happier with the seagull s6 especially for the price
i was an ernie ball guy for a long time
straps dont get any better than this
i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case
this is my 2nd hercules stand
samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website
and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out
and you cant beat the price
yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible
the color is spot on with the pictures shown
easy on the fingers too
its not multihundred dollar instrument but for kids and beginners its a good deal
however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp
so save your dough buy any color but red
get one of these if you play with a pick
my recording playback sounds like its live
makes tuning a lot easier and accurate
i have several now one for every guitar
i love reverb and wouldnt buy an amp without it
as another guy said 34how could i live without this pedal before
disappointing was looking for to receiving these
i highly recommend this cable
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item
so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out
the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar
nice natural finish all shiny and new
knobs were hard to see settings
the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow
i bought 2 of these about 6 months ago
this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar
they are just the most wonderful picks ive used
for the price its good
ive played guitar for over 10 years
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
ill stick with dunlop gator grip
try it till you ready to by more expensive string
i like cakewalks software better anyways just my preference
i havent had much chance to play it but so far so good
the fenderschaller design covers all of these bases well
it has a green led and large mark for being on target
i love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing
it can range from dramatic to very subtle
nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body
the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome
thats why i say this is the best on the world
if you can make the software work consistently
it looks really good almost like an ornament
this one built like a tank
i ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends
to your weekly moving equipment caravan
its ok for the money and works good
this works better than the qk10b model by the same company
the standard 9v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun
work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use
and why is the lineout so darn noisy
this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china
even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing
it has so many functions
if youre tired of using batteries pick this thing up
ive tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc
it required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup
i mean shouldnt it just immediately work
my wife bought this guitar for me as a gift
but it hasnt broke yet and it might never break
my banjo arrived a couple days after i ordered it
these strings sound full and warm on the instrument
it is a good purchase
perfect size for us big guys
it definitely doesnt add any more fatness
very happy with it considering the price point
pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change
a guitar player for 20 years now i decided to give it a try
his shipping team do great work
i swear i was done in 20 minutes
its expensive for a joyo but cheap for a really good od stomp
a definite improvement on a classic stompbox
i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke
right size well made and these do the job
i recommend this capo to anyone
ive had it for almost 3 years now
the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however
they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune
it does the job but it is a little low on the quality side
after testing each of the tripod stands
i really couldnt find anything wrong  with it
works just like its supposed to
ive tried some usb sound cards without success
and whats up with the tuning thing
thats a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses
sounds great with an electric acoustic
all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts
bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor
i use these light guage strings because i have arthritis
its possible i have a defective one not sure
well built made to last and looks great
the built in tap metronome is a cool idea
the only thing i would do to improve is add an off button
so i ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter
no complaints on these strings
so most ukes dont fit well
fender 351 picks are some of the best picks money can buy
only thing i miss a bit is a headphone jack
it does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color
unlike my steel string capo this uses a screwknob to tighten not spring loaded
dont use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase
the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabes
here are a few of the features that i really like about it
the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird
strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel
i have no issues with quality or feel its too loose
so like most daddario strings
they do what theyre supposed to do
doesnt reduce sound worth a darn
unlike the fender which you have to press and hold
these are the only picks i use
its nice and does its job
i tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it
this is a cheap extremely low quality strap
its comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches
spend an extra 10 and save yourself the headache
this strap fits right feels good and looks handsome
anyway that is the view from where i sit
this is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars
not a bad product acceptable at its price point just didnt impress me much
i got it for my son and he wasnt impressed
no instructions came with the package
i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch
cant beat it for the price
for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions
i think tortex  delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by
you really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly
i havent used it a lot yet but i really like it so far
this is a good product which ive seen many people use
the distortion it gives is good
this should improve my sustain and tone even more
from experience they tend to just die without notice
it is perfect for what it is
i bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection
ive switched over to this design and couldnt be happier with it
probably not but so what
so now that i have it i can finally record to my laptop
they fit all of my gear
the jacks are high quality construction
this pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a blueridge br160
just another 20 output would make these 5 stars perfect
the loop feature is quite good the delayecho entirely satisfactory
ill stick with what i know well
this capo also has a pick holder
so i am convinced that they work now
now a days i read they are rebranded chinese tubes
i use sound studio but the included free softwareaudacityworks practically as well
overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavyduty
it is a great lock and works fine but is not for me
i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid
well built easy setup very quiet
tons of bang for your buck
also it clamps without bending the strings
the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable
however the sound left something to be desired
the focus knob is interesting  it doesnt act exactly like a tone knob
construction  solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff
this small device has amazing quality
keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time
the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor
exactly as advertised no complaints from this user
its surprisingly loud for a small amp
this is pot metal as well which again is fine
its a great pedal period
this power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals
this is a great deal for two microphone stands
you can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq
my strings stay in tune even better with this installed
once i read about the bugera b5 i knew i wanted one
that song along should keep my practicing for a long time
its quality outweighs its price
i have 2 70w 1234 amps and a big fender dsp 212
also there arent really any quality digital options that are significantly cheaper
check out this rather entertaining howto video to see the installation process
i use it on my guitars and my banjo
there are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers
but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio
it is sturdy and small
for the price you can not beat these
but if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse
i used this with my planet waves 9v adapter
out of the box it has a nice weight to it
bought this instead and it plain rocks
liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads
turn it on clip it on and tune
these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer
update 6614 still the best pick ive ever played
nothing to complain about here
be warned about it though
good price too nothing to complain about
im pretty happy with this one right now
but i cant help it  i like this guitar
they have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark ernie ball feel
look at the price because this thing really sounds good
im having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings
the plastic thumbpicks match tone very well
the orange gearlux logo looks pretty cool too
my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion
this is a pack of guitar strings
only about 4134 long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs
whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out
great tone great string life with a little maintenance and very reasonably priced
packaging is well thought out too
a very wellmade strap with great looks and a super price
i will review that later
my son much prefers the elixir strings
and its exactly the same
this is the godzilla of volume pedals
its a power adaptor so it isnt too exciting but it works fine
the snark sn8 delivered on both counts and more
while the bx5a has a bigger tweeter separate xlr  trs jacks
its a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works
often we get what we pay for
the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over
helps the grip a lot
it is so small that it cannot hold all mics
seems like reasonably durable construction
does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music
the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist
im sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways
product does what you would think
well that is beyond me
its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it
but otherwise i think its great
for those looking for insane crunch this isnt for you
my hands sweat a lot so i really need the grip
tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again
quality is there in construction and signal passing
the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right
drducks wax is worth the extra 3
boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet
you can never go wrong with a kyser
they are very flexible easy to handle and of good quality
i would have expected it to cost much more
works great as a stand for the elec
i brought for someone else
when i order something new i expect it to be new
the sound is great the wattage is good everything is wonderful
would also be ok with guitars
normal pickguard screws nothing special here
weak sounding and break very easily
over kill or uber cool you decide
88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase
i cant say what battery life is as only use withan ac adapter
i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product
it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up
the features and sound are the same
you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps
its cheap its basic and it works
beside having a great range of audio pickup the mic is so versatile
use for both reference with a gnx4 and guitar and easy listening
it also looks very nice
but how does it perform
i highly recommend this product
the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful
i tried martin strings once and hated them
it took at least 15 minutes to do that update
its solid and works great very adjustable
feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise
i cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good
i am so pleased and excited with my guitar
the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive
this one does it all
it is well built performs well and sells at a very reasonable price
for the price i feel like it is a steal
id recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a builtin tuner
so i cant speak to really heavy use of the product
so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h4 recorder
i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical
he says its great so that is my review
this stand is useful for small instruments
this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved
sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried
try it out for yourself
i have 3 of the danelectro effects pedals
but i was happily surprised
this is a nice strap
youd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over
ill try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said
the action is low and the guitar structure is perfect
with the gain at halfway you get great addc crunch
look at the picture of it next to a coke can
and im the better for it
try the underappreciated md2 mega distortion or the excellent joyo ultimate drive
it sounds exactly like how i always imagined like in all those records
this is the last one you will ever need to buy
it will increase in value to you at least
those are pretty crucial to a drumset
but the sound that comes out of that 834 speaker is big
the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate
only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back
they fit they work they are quiet and they wont make your life miserable
it ties onto the headstock
ive been trying different strings for years
it is just as describedi am happy
as for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generoussized screws etc
the only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming
i have a ceramic and this steel slide
i think i may need to tighten some screws
love amazon why shop anywhere else
yes it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants
this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market
very easy to take offput on
they dont break either although they do wear down over time
i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks
this is a great effect
too bad so sad for them
with ten packs it will likely be a while before i do so
i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item
these will be my mainstay
perfect for recording loud drums
for the price this is a steal
what can i really say
i much prefer a brighter more chimey sound
its simple basic but i dont think it does that good of a job
i bought a second pair of these
longer scales like a strat
had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars
these are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality
finish stitching and adjustments are quality
the controls are intuitive and easy to use
everything is connected using this single length patch
i have never heard my guitar sound so good
my son needed a capo expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons
had them over two months a they work great
i have yet to try this through a loop
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price
just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic
i am trying to learn a few slide riffs
i already owned two of these tuners previously  purchased these for friends
ive purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one
that said i purchased this for my home recording studio
now if only all windscreens were this sturdy id be a happy customer
originally i bought another snark and liked it well enough
this is totally different its the real thing
just check out my review video for the blue pop
when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift
sounds good and has great intonation
i immediately noticed a difference in the warmth articulation and fullness of my sound
order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring
great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered
this is the wah i was looking for
this is a very stable comfortable seat
these are good replacements or upgrades
i love the 90 degree connection
it looks and fits just as shown in the picture
i will stick to gls products from this point forward
last but not least  they are bad for frets
a little more interest in the manufacture means more quality
this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice
this stuff has been around for years
youd be better off with a similarlypriced smalldiaphragm condenser and a windscreen
this is the first delay that ive owned and im not looking back
so im sending it back
just restrung my 12 string
ill be buying two more
after a time the pinch is bit much
i cannot do it with one hand
but this one worked perfectly
tests multiple types of cords also
comes with a velvet pouch and dvd
the 90s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it
i also think the price is pretty fair
im a gadget lover and this is a good one
this is my fifth time buying this stuff
it is quite bright sounding
a deadsimple idea that works great
this is a great combination
ive been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010
the quality seems to be good and installation went fine
it works great though and for the price its wonderful
i have only had to replace the battery once
have not gigged with it as yet
but im still giving it 5 stars
i absolutely adore this instrument
i am a longtime musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments
this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps
cant think of a single negative thing about this product
to me for the price its made cheaply
this is the best usb microphone out for under 100 bucks
so testing on their own mics
amazon should have clarified in their item description
it doesnt cut the bass out
the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist
i used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly
these cables are no different
i have only 2 requirements for a tuner 1
i guess this kit works okay but its hard to use
to me they just sound complete
all in all be patient and all will be well
too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation
they are well made reliable and cost effective
on a dark stage this works great
all snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner
also i like having the middle green led for tuning
now it looks beautiful again
on off switches on each
if it works theres nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it
its a cool pedal especially considering its price but dont be fooled
this guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box
i use it with a small amp for singing
there are snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
the face pivots around and the display is nice and bright
simple light and does what its suppose to
the reason is its not designed properly
classy and comfortable it looks perfect on my beat up black 76 tele custom
ive used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars
mostly slinkys or super slinkys
the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy
overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great
however it does not come with a cable
was easy to adjust and is very stable
these are a little brighter than reds and are best for live playing
and for many its all thats required
the cleans are warm and
but again its way off tune
because well 0o it is a lp
to me they didnt feel right
the almost play themselves imo
i will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it
its also squeakily noisy when string winding
it has compression exciter  deesser as well as eq and reverb
overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand
but for me tone is 80 of the equation
i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy
the weight is great for my style of playing
did not hold the strings down very well for me
this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards
dont expect miracles but this helps quite a bit
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries
the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing
based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these
not sure if thats from rough handling
its has a deep overdrive
having a dozen similara few for me and a few to sharemeets the need
the product is good surprisingly loud
nothing out of the ordinary
update about 2 years later  i wont do without these
i have dozens of guitars
pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate
good leather that should last a long time
fabulous clean tone and great distortion sound running off a solidstate amp and pedals
i own 3 now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection
unfortunately my extralong fingers find this very difficult to play
they sound wonderful and cost very little
dont be surprised if it happens to you
it is the sound that i like though
ive been using this product for many years
that bright sound can last about 6 months or more
i compared this to a c1 which is pretty good for half the price
not a big knock actually
the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read
my voice sounds great with this thing
its a great little unit
they are great and last forever
maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up
it was clearly a toy and i sold it for 25 without regret
i get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks
i have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for squiers
when it comes to quality of cables im really not to picky about it
for many guitars including my j45 theres nothing ive found that ive liked better
my kids love to hear me play it
good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this
easy to install these buttons on the guitar
neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to
its worked equally well on my acoustic  my electric
still its wellconstructed and would make a good desktop mic mount
this is a nifty little tuner
the tool is extremely useful
and little it is not much bigger than the jack
this thing just screams for solos and is very heavy for rhythm
i havent checked yet but id say there is a 4050 loss in volume
performance using the behringer was good
ive had it for about a year now and have no complaints
just clip it onto the bridge
i get about a month of playing from those strings
i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it
it feels very sturdy and im not worried about it cracking anytime soon
no residue no sticky and no oil film
much better for the money than i was expecting
easier to strum sounds good to me
i chose these strings based on reviews i have read on the website
the mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16000 hz
and when you attach the headphones it works great
i used it in acoustic guitar and on the ukelele without any problem
some are better than others and this one works perfectly
you cant go wrong here
the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar
most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med
this one matches the acousticelectric i bought perfectly
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick
bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me
the high strings will talk to you
i get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack
i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true
which is a common complaint and indicative of gfss crummy products in general
i play rythm leads and sing in my gig
needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill
you can just plug in your guitar or bass
i am so happy with my changes
okay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive
i dont regret this purchase at all
i purchased this for my daughter who is 10
if this happens to you dont worry
i put a quarter under the 10th
goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks
update   we received a replacement for this item
this was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and tone
all i wanted was a simple tuner
holds my cordoba in position perfectly
different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above
ive used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great
its large and takes up space on my pedal board
if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately
i bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard
so this is more than adequate for daily practice
for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesnt advertise
the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera
all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonablypriced tool
i have been purchasing these strings for over 15 years now
so i ordered this one to replace it
i have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my strats
otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam
build good for carry and balance
i love these clipon tuners
tight on some not on others
i have several types of capos this one seems well built
these stay in every case i own
it is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera
buy this it does work and it works very well
i completely agree with 34jpfromoh34
it sounds balanced warm and bright
getting demoted from the front page
this epiphone hardshell case is a real bargain
it has a nice red paint job
this little product is the perfect solution
it looks cool and sounds just fine and clear
theyre dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound
it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability
for the price it is a good deal
its got a nice look too
no triangle or civil war
im going to buy a couple more as gifts
it does the job perfectly
this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset
i should start by saying that i did not buy this from amazon
theres no heavy reverb there
you will not regret this purchase
round and flat wound strings
id say definitely do not get this if youre a tech or gear head
i purchased this to connect a sennheiser e825 mike with guitar amps
this little stand serves so many purposes for me
the click effects wear out sooner
i would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player
that was over 3 years ago
i tried some martins ej16s which i love on my seagull s6
all set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe
i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter
had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not elixir
it is well made and stays on without falling off
they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the
i didnt expect this much volume from light strings
sound quality  the bx5 sounds neutral and balanced
it does not sound like an amplified pedal
an excellent value highly recommended
34 i also prefer the sn2 display
i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks
added a couple drops and it worked like a charm
ive been using them for 6 months or so
even with that issue i think the jam is a good value
i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well
dont forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them
my guitar originally came with daddrio exp and they sounded good
this one says specifically for a ukulele
no wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category
have others i trust more
its a good one for beginers like myself
what may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone elses palate
just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on
perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets
i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased
without a doubt a very sturdy cable
this is from the cleartone cables website about gold connectors don
i found this one to be made well enough that it plays well
it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size
i bought mine used three years ago and it works great
if you jump over to these http www
well the gibson cloth does have a whipstitch edging around it
4 stars seems about right
i have them all and they all work great
making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable
youll be able to hear them rattle
the only thing i wouldve like different is the accessory box inside
every once in awhile ill step outside of my box
this isnt the best power supply available
they have never let me down
the two experiences are not the same
ill update this review if i ever figure it out
for this review i used the services of my supermusician friend mike
5 stars in my book more if theyd allow that
the stereo out is very cool for using two amps
has a great clean tone with a lot of low end
i wanted to do it through my maudio profire 610
slow and fast position on the trigger for more control
ill never use another string on acoustics
cons  transformer on cord and antenna on remote
these patch cords work like a champ
i feel chained to my workstation
these are by no means touring cases
i used alaska picks for years which are very good
fits any guitar banjo or even a cello
excellent strap for the money
they are worth the extra cost
this includes taking the time to store them for use
thats what makes them so much fun to play and modify
i was skeptical about this 34impossible to drop34 thing which i read
planet waves signature guitar picks  always the best always reliable
no problems until i got to the g string then pop another breaker
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands
i have the older version of this as well this newer one
its sturdy and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position
not worth shipping it back no big deal
built like a tank  brushed finish  connections on the front
its nice to have a place for picks on the guitar
this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first
my guitar stays in tune when capoed
the product works very well im able to power 5 of my pedals easily
granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist
it curls around my microphone stand well too
new tuners like the snark sn8b are a joy in comparison
here are my pros and cons
works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely
forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos
still using it today 2 years later
so perhaps i dont know what shade burgandy really is
works great with or without polish
pros  it is small bright well built and works great
why am i so impatient
it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv
the sound of the current mini is classic fender singlecoil
i use all types and all brands and fenders are always predictably great quality
ive been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that
to be fair i have not tried many other vibes
again its a clipon tuner so dont expect razorsharp accuracy
i bought this to use in childrens church
i have enjoyed my protec strap
makes this great and i mean great microphone even better
if sound quality is your primary concern well
setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic
better to have a little bit of extra length than too short
the only thing i find worse than the intelli is the gooseneck
turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts
but this tuner destroyed those expectations
the 5w setting can really crank out the volume
cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder
mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up
the neck had a huge bow in it
i take my trusty fender esquire
i am very pleased with this purchase
it was very digital soundingat this point i wasnt sure what i wanted
back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo
excellent product from a fantastic seller
nice as a tabletop effect
the supplier refunded some of the postage
the various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing
very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find
the noise suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise
i have found that this model fits my needs perfectly
i am a beginner guitar player
saves space at cramped gig sites
the small footprint is nice for those with limited space
its the third color of the same pick i purchased
once its fit to you though it works beautifully
the bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine
they seem to work well so far
not a sufficient defect to return the instrument
they dont play at all like what i was expecting
i like the length too
we use it to hold the musics and dont need to turn the head
normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater
the switches and dials may also fail over time
based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller
plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus
our second week and all is well
this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be
they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
who cares so long as it sounds this good
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
i love these strings they never stop amazing me
a bit too thick for me
this liitle box works great for my needs
i dont know what i was expecting
they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons
its a decent unit but stopped working completely after about 6 months
i am pleased that they match my telecaster
it makes a great temporary hard shell case
for the money there isnt a better tuner on the market today
installed these on my schecter c1 hellraiser
i must say thanks to those reviewers
its a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part
strike a note once and its sharp
and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string ive tryed
a nonbuiltinbuiltin tuner at this price cannot be beat
super leather very well puttogether
the answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking for
it was about 5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine
ive been playing for over 40 years
its fun and easy to record my own songs
the range of adjustability is excellent
works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio
i have had no problems with them
works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options
nevertheless the sound is quite good
no more couch and kitchen chairs for me
you cant go wrong with the ts9
so its get better as you use it
excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage
the pedal itself works perfectly fine
further its class complaint so you dont have to use behringers drivers
the only complaint i have is that theyre too thin for me
theres simply no place to clip it
its simple portable and sturdy
it was what i had expected it to be
the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible
plus they feel and sound good
they also depend on the built in adda converters in the ipadios device
great product  well made  worth every penny
this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts808 pedal
this is so darn cool
that speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product
not much to write about here but it does exactly what its supposed to
the snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable cardboard box
enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves
enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslytotally worth the buy
i was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked
i will buy more in the future
dunlop provided an inexpensive winder thats durable
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on
sooo i figured why not have a go at it
really am impressed with this gig bag
its a good cloth for polishing no more to say about it
if you use more than 2 of 10 max gain it sounds awful
there is one area where the pig prevails
i have reviewed this before
i only wish it came with two of them
also the pedal just started oscillating a few times
i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away
i have experimented with others but always come back to them
stores 99 loops doubt id ever in my lifetime need that many
i own several and have had no trouble with them
the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened
all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great
cant say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad
i will buy planet waves from now on
i dont think it picks up those long wavelengths so well
but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite
the quality of the nickel is very good too
other musicians were impressed by it as well
i like that this one shuts off automatically
these capo i know will lose their tension in time
but i realized that im a music snob
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
joyo continues to surprise me
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great
i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars
a few are actually a notchabove the others
this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body
also since a purchased a 3 pack
it seems like yes they are
thats what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in youtube
it does hit the frets but doesnt seem to do any damage
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products have always presented
the x3live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot
this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones
in addition to the standard dampit theres a soundhole cover
i am very satisfied with my purchase
i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great
every guitarist needs a good tuner
snark tuners have always performed well for me
the extra light is easier on the fingers  but they sound thinner too
do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil
ive use these strings for years
so it will force you to clean up your playing a bit
it does the perfect job for podcasting as well as gameplay videos
its easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well
it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also
the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles
pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well
the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place
i got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens
wish they would hold a couple more
they had good reviews and the price was right
its an optical illusion but not a sign of higher quality instrument making
to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads
overall great strings and pretty consistent
i have one of these as well as several other microphones
i ordered with my new guitar
i wasnt expecting pro level gear for a sub 100 pedal
ive tried to like this pedal i really have
line 6 has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones
the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect
anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed
this inexpensive capo works as advertised
the effect isnt as noticeable on darker finishes though
im guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel
i paid for the entire system
you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better
i am quite happy with the build quality
we are a tough act to follow
this is the pedal to own
i didnt notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported
i own 5 different gauges
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric736 lbs
this is not a toy
i bought this at guitar center and now wish that i hadnt
i like that sharp thwack sound
i never use it so i really only wasted my money
buy one and see what i mean
i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate
but no harm done still works great
another excellent gadget from planet waves
its easy to install and i guess its cheap
simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually
oh and one thing im a bit iffy about is spectraflexs lifetime warranty
hows that for an endorsement
i love my snark sn5 tuner
again this material seems to be nonmarring
put these on my prs se 245 and i love em
60 picks perfectly by the way
got this for my wife she just loves it
plus the humbuzz is so loud you cant hear anything from the microphone
this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap
i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio
some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons
i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself
when i got the patches they were better quality than i expected
the feedback is good and theyre stiff enough to strike clear tones
by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little
i leave them on my 12strings and one of the 6s
this should be your first pedal
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive
emery cloth for polishing frets is niceworth 2000for sure
it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable
and possibly an envelope filter at some point
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
i highly recommend this quality xlr cable
with this amp everything is built in
they seem more durable than other brands
also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings
sam ash was very courteous in fixing the problem
when he was done he said i love this mic
the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage
for the price its a really good deal
i can put 6 7 picks on it
these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not
still id rather stick with a copper slide
they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly
switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly
i really liked the sound
i just order 3packs so i can have some on hand
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works
they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gellike feeling
the slightly thicker string is not bad
it kind of smells like motor oil
fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue
it is very precise and accurate leading you to perfect tuning every use
it does the job is comfortable and the price is right
this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from
most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians
one reviewer wrote that it is a very lowlow
they were the right size
great pedal very lush and usable tones
in conclusion i see no reason not to buy and install these again
im very satisfied with this pick
he is very pleased with these picks
this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices
it wont do long delays
outlets 182113 can all be used to power either 9v or 12v pedals
its adjustable and allows me to fit a clampon microphone boom arm
other than that notmuch difference
they snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality
this one is a keeper
there are other solutions to this dilemma
this is a good deal
i cant remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff
just gives you a mellow reverbish echo
this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal
so if you want 24 different distortions go for it
they most replicate a fender med
these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying
for the money its a great pedal
for 8 you cant beat it
a review mentioned it didnt come with batteries
i gave it 4 stars because it hasnt been maintenance free
you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs
for most metalhard rock music the gain range is enough for me
so why only 4 stars
it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it
cool looking pedal box to boot
to me thats just freaking incredible
great idea great concept and great quality
im sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though
not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 13 its beefier
the ability to adjust treb and bass is nice
one of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage
kinda cool if you ask me
only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz
welldesigned and reliable i highly recommend these
i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards
i mean lets face it
but the biggest change ive experienced is with the tone block change
on the cannon the lever was vertical
okay i bought a 1966 telecaster brand new back then
the toneprint feature is amazing
to the point where its nonexistent
no modifications needed not even bending
what more could you ask for in a strap
now im faced with working out all of my own presets
otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it
so far they are holding their tone and brightness
the value of this amp is amazing
each to their own i suppose
i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p
i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time
maybe some lock tight would help
yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of
who would these appeal to
not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie
i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic
my first elec guitar im 60 years old and this guitar is perfect
the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material
muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in db
mine is modified with the monte allums trigain rectifier modification and its absolutely killer
the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case
i put it in my cart and continued shopping
it gives me the portability i needed to move about my house
the textured grip surface is great
im currently using the snark on my guitar
overall for the price it is an incredible value
i am extremely happy with this purchase
once together it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably
i bought this 12 pack and they
play the slow 4 chords to maggot brain
it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way its supposed to
why do you have to be so difficult
this is an always on pedal for me
its easier to strap up because of the quick release tab
used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 strats
6 stars if they had it that high
i was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size
this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings
i needed a cheap mic stand that didnt break the bank
they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course
that wasnt the case with the first model
the gold plating ensures a solid connection
i used to tune my guitar online
i even moved it once and it still sticks fine
i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build
it was a great item
ive read the revues and some dont do them justice
and the price was right too
the fun old rock n roll stuff
they are suitable for rock punk country and funk
but they either sound badly are prone to electricalmechanical problems or both
thats what it looks like
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each
shouldnt it have a full battery since it is brand new
they make another version which is less pointy
all type of delays are sounds beatiful
basically the cherub is just too sensitive
they do get warmer than id like
playing feel is fairly smooth for roundwound strings and they last for ages
great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments
it also is feature loaded but with one kicker
to keep your guitar looking and sounding great
i have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes
if you want to understand any theory start here after learning basic chords
not as noisy better feel
i dont think you could get a better piece for the price point
so these are  pretty great strings
repeating the process yielded identical results
the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 34 size ether
and its a great price buy them
it is a cutaway design without electronics
many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo
tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over
havent tried the trumpet yet
they are size 1046 which is just right for my electric guitars
the adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever it does its job well
pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue
young smaller player or a
then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and youre ready to go
the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic
ive now retired the boss pedal
when you turn it back on it usally works fine
they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent
things i dont like much 1
first time for a  soft wedgie
the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up
these seem a lot more stable than the 1046 i had been using
or any combo little amp
she thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials
surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board
09 strings without additional hardware
the arm is adjustable and long
i was surprised because outwardly the string didnt look that bad
for me the 11s felt a little loose
for price and quality these are top notch
you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case
the price for the replacement packets
these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele
i could not be happier
upfront the pedal sounds great
its easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician
it has less granularity in the display for example
its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit
this is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin
then its the wrong amp
this is what gives them their charm and voice
straplocks came with black  white felt thats a nice touch
whats the difference between the 58 and the 48
so someone messed up in quality control
i love the dual bulb design
i use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics
this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings
i have a blue voodoo all tube amp
the display is very easy to read
attaches firmly and does the job
what did i want for this price anyway
if theres a sale ill buy some more
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass
whether thats a good thing
its not bad if you want a uke but its pretty small
and was way cheaper then the line6 adapter
this guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish
i bought this to try out on my baritone uke
just clip it on and tada
i can see a few years of careful use
he wanted a tone that sounded like his
also i have two epiphones
i really dont like it
an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly
this is a great place to begin
the price at amazon was the best i could find without buying used crap
thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping
i bought this for a friend whos previous tuner was lost
the paint fade away after a while but dont let that stop you
great tuner for my guitar class
8020 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out
it measures 4 1634 in diameter so check your guitar closely
this strap is very nice and comfortable
i have two small grips though
but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls
this is an interesting limited effect pedal
so i play while im watching football or baseball
a wise choice for the budget conscious
if not just invest about 6 into an adapter like i did
otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding
this shoulder rest is very comfortable and really helps get the right playing angle
thats my only complaint about it
they do take some time getting used to
housed in a plastic casing
i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though
i know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally
the amp gives an audiable pop when powered down
these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price
i could not order that arm separately
overall im happy with this brand
these strings are performance value and always give me a great sound
jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cutout
the sound is so warm and bright
but ill be going to coated strings next
they are still usable as decent picks
i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger
these picks sound good and have lasted well
these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again
mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival
i paid about 75 for mine and have zero regrets
lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument
june 2014 update the mini has become my preferred goto electric
maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage
amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience
i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction
works well and easier to read than many of its competitors
i have to wiggle and hold to get signal
for the price i dont think it can be beat
i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector
they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto
oh well for once i got cheap
i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional
very good item if you are a musician you need it
great pedal and it is still built like a tank
adjustments are easy to make and the fitfeel is fine
works so much better than the string around the neck thing
the point is this pedals so great and has a great range of dirt
easy to assemble and use
strung these up on my lp goldtop with p90s
i paid 50 for it and it works great
well its a solid chunk of metal
but then its only fifty bucks
holds my les paul and feels secure
by the way bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one
im updating a previous negative review
every strap is a levys
however the price was good
too much bass and other garbage
for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect
this is not a distortion petal like the boss ds1 or metal zone mt2
i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic
wow  they all come to life and make the amp sizzle
this does what it says it does
it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say
can set different pitch than a4404
it hasnt given him any problems so far
its easy to put on and holds the strings well
the whole unit is heavywood and very durable
the mic looks good but has almost no mass
for the most part yes
he said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great
i think it is a well made product and good value
the best eb slinkys ive ever used
amazoncomgpproductb000ws1q4e direct box i purchased from amazon as well
i only have one minor complaint
i dont know much about delay and ive never really used it
it doesnt have a strap button at the top end
sound great and look great
even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy
i dont think it lastforever but it works great for my peavey patriot guitar
the other hardware isnt much better
it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender
this is thicker than the
daddario always makes great products at great prices
i used the daddario j53 black nylon strings
trust this cymbal once and you wont be disappointed
switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato
aquila seems to be the most popular now
you know if you do guitar work you need a neck stand
theyre an industry standard for a reason  you dont need 15 dollar strings
switch is a soft switch so there is no click
got this for a 15 year old learning guitar
i just loaded the whole prerecorded track into a slot
you might be surprised how good it sounds
i agree with all the other reviews
the sound is excellent the playability comfy
if you want a really good sm58 clone i would recommend a behringer xm8500
and every student ive ever had has one on their guitar as well
others may prefer a different sound
count on fender to give u a good product
hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty
can easily set it up for live situations
there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things
the hd sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great
it is a nice strap
daddario always puts out a nice product
i wanted to wait until i knew a little something before i reviewed it
its so bad i just cant use it at all
give a good phase sounds like waylon would use
011 strings are what i use
the way you string the guitar makes a difference
great laser nice big fat stars red and green worth the money
its either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much
so in short this is a mixed bag
i recommend this multiplug to everyone
sent it back after one day
the crisp and solid vibration is just top notch
try finding a midi tutorial that is usable
this is a fine product
they hold up for a very long time
picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed
my music partner says she prefers the way these silkandphosphor blend with her fiddle
its just not strong enough
however for the home player this tuner will work just fine
rest assured ive voted with my feet
however once i opened it i discovered an undamaged snark tuner inside
but it sounds great with singlecoils too
tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides
was using cheep pidmont blues harpstoys
good quality and thik cussion
now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines
go with the fast fret
thanks for the prompt and good service
also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isnt
again though not that big a deal to fix if its not
this is hands down the best delay pedal i have ever used
they are small which takes getting used to though
truly a unique and versatile creation
for playing they sound pretty good
this is a good one at a good price
id like to know the markup
appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever
i turned that light off and the buzz went away
not much more can be said about these awesome strings
there is no way i would use these
i found that others had the same issue
they are the best out there
i am now a believer
knobs and switch are sturdy
while i didnt need volume this little guy can be loud
i bought it myself as a kind of experiment
no pedal including a 200 boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies
its going back to the store where i purchased it
i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain
sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better
the price cant be beat and will give your guitar that 70s look
maybe ill see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work
i wouldnt reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage
buy this if you want a started that isnt bobo or a toy
i think this tube basically brought the volume down
i am really impressed with this mic
they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings
bought these for my sons electric guitar
however once clipped properly you shouldnt have issues
only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as vaders
its a great intro model not just for ipads
bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1
when i received the strap i realized it doesnt fit a banjo
the best nonrackmount reverb i have ever had
they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks
dont get this if you have man hands
this is the new and improved snark
it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them
best recomended quality and price
i got two of these but wish i had got better ones
just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds
they help me pick up my guitars much more often
it just worked like the old one
easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response
hard to find just 10 mike cords
i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long
all in all great value for a good item
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
have used it several times and first battery still has juice
when it comes to music it is34 that little extra34 that makes the difference
they are picks for guitars and they work
ive bought three of these now and plan to buy more
the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use
a very well built great sounding guitar
i bought this for quality ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live
im a procheapo and i hated this thing
this is a really nice product for the price
so i bought based solely on the reviews here
i guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag
i would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on
its a decent pedal very solid
are you likely to find it in a highend professional studio
you gotta bend over and flip those
i use daddario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle
i like the durability of it and the onoff switch
my son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more
for the price u cant go wrong
great sound from this bad boy
this portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone
i tried it in the key of g and got useful results
xlr cables are hard to mess up
the other unit seems to be rock solid
the knobspots are nice and the basstreble pots are notched at 12
needed to get mic into computer via the usb port
right so look for accesories and cablescords
of course your mileage may vary
point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me
i recently purchased a replacement the sn8b but found it really disappointing
the case is better padded than i might have expected for the price
it is a good thing it does not cost a lot
this is a problem because the sm7bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches
the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these
i upgraded and would absolutely do it again
i couldnt put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars
you have to use all of the strings once opened
they work great every time
good quality strong and excellent finish
overall though a great value for a quality cable
the dava master control pick dmcp is a very nice  useful pick
this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage
i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot
also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet
this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up
second these are musical instruments
clips onto pretty much any mic stand
the fingers in front hold the instrument in
so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone
it will work on pretty much any guitar
who invented this thing heman
i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim
ernie ball 2223 super slinky electric strings
hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually
i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me
for me that does not justify it
jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow
im surprised by the results
ive had fun with it
this beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job
especially when it costs three times more
the tried and true shubb works great at a great price
i replaced the strings right away
i wasnt expecting much from the mic
for the price i dont think i could have done better
worth the small price you pay
get a mxr custom badass 78 distortion
others found it awkward to attach  i did not
the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material
the same company makes a tuning capo which i find handy at times
for me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz
my favorite pick out of this bunch was  the dunlop jazz 3 pick
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
i never give anything a 100
the price is fair and it serves its purpose
but im now a convinced snark user
i like the sound of this amp
i believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds
the strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition
it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors
the y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a stratocaster
it doesnt scratch the guitar and works great
my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree
im using windows and i have to suggest using the asio drivers whenever possible
i would recommend this capo
wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables
i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar
and it would be but the holes are too tight
a must have for guitar teachers imho
my problems with it are 3 fold   1
cheap to buy but cheaply made
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
i definitely recommend this pedal
small yet sturdy enough to hold a fullsize guitar
taylor ships this guitar with these strings  and for a good reason
they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain
i used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets
if you havent ever experimented with capos try them out
10 mm is the perfect combination
looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss
it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board
my bass is not that old but really needed to be cleaned and polished
and it required some dremelingsanding to get it to sit correctly
it works well for holding up a guitar and it looks good doing it
simply search  for guitar stands on here and see for yourself
i am going to an a pickguard to this one
its still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting
if you have issues with the driver definitely update
kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice
but based on my experience i dont recommend this one
it holds both electric and acoustics
but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy
this also helps those of us using electric guitars that dont have extrawound humbuckers
its tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe
this guitar pays better than some 3 times is value
unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the 5th star
but it was always awkward
while it is just a stand it seems to be sturdy and durable
i only wish it went up to 11
it folds up very nicely
i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one
i think the product should have been around 7080
not only is it interferencefree it has a much warmer intimate sound
its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain
i like this cable for it has an angled plug
my verdict  awesome  it sounds just like i remember
i found that i had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal
2 make sure you know what length you need for a cable
it works well with several different instruments that i have
very midrangey sound as well
i was using the bigger triangle kind before
28 coiled plug end to plug end
very stable easy to assemble  and a nice price
folds compact to fit in your guitars hard case or gig bag
and  it doesnt come with any manuals to speak of
great microfiber polishing cloth for a great price
i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something
id recommend this over the larger tubular type
i have always liked these sticks
this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal
the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing
first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express
i am not disappointed in the least
he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more
completely satisfied with this purchase
love love love this pick holder
this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones
schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with locktite
it is a very handy tool
bad news   these aquila strings are not standard on some others
i just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them
the daddario sets are good stuff
inexpensive solution and quite handy
this does it perfectly well
for 35 or so im not going to complain
the picks are pretty comfy to hold
it is not variable speed
this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product
the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke
it just sounds heavier tighter and more articulate
they provide enough surface area that they wont slip easily from between your fingers
i havent tested it for recording purposes
i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track
thats because youre hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones
it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range
now i can actually get on with the music  another excellent behringer purchase
i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best
i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include
technical support is also almost zero
most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries
bought this strap for use with my dean evo electric
high gain settings even something basic like a marshall jcm900 were practically unusable
looking to buy more soon
something i will have to get used to
i cant stop using it
now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic
the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfect
overall i rely on daddario strings for all my instruments
these are the best strings around
amazon was great in conjunction with the seller
theres just one button so its idiotproof
this is my first foray into that world
it works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth
i love the joyo pedals
very simple to use for overdubbing
you need to do that with the speaker switch
why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio
other people i know whove had this tuner have complained about lack of durability
seems to stay in tune pretty well too
accidental turnon in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem
id be satisfied with the daddario they do sound good
i had a lot of questions and concerns when i ordered this
it does the job well and is pretty large
wash up in soap and water and let dry
the bonus is that its also one of the least expensive that ive seen
it feels like you get a boost in your midrange
bottom line  as a monitor look no further
you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose
legs open to set up easy
i didnt expect them to  but a guy can dream cant he
here are their key points  good quality construction
if i need more ill probably buy this again
i have a candy apple red squier surf statocaster
it was worth the wait
you may have experienced the problems of musicians
for the money it works
it is cheap to buy at amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning
it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate
and i like the sound better
i dont know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not
still suck at bending 3 4
i have never played a string instrument
the learning curve is moderate
using it as a back up stage mic
i just sort of dealt with it
the hohner special 20 just seems to have this little extra
but didnt have the cash for another at4033 or similar
i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones
just a simple well made product that does the job
it uses a cr2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time
and then there are the micros
electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are important
the external power brick for this guy seems fragile
just a warning to those that are picky
it records what you sound like
it has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse
it is a nice looking cord
very portable and does the job it was designed to do
not the fingers but the hand and wrists so
others may feel differently i am sure
it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation
im quite please with the xenyx 1202
im a stickler for the oem parts so i typically by only fender stuff
they arent rough textured so they are easier on the fingers
i installed them on a prs se santana in just a few minutes
if thats not a problem definitely worth the price
most small tube amps dont have built in effects
i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option
easy to use and handy for any string instruments
easy to install and hanging and releasing is a nobrainer
been playing for five decades now
nice addition to my studio
i like the look and feel of these
a bunch of years ago a variety of cliponmicrophones began to be marketed
not really a big concern though
any guitarist knows how one of these works
he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well
the first arms the track the second begins the recording
maybe it is my locations but that was great too
what can you say about a tool
the long haul will be the test
update  the more i use this tuner the more i like it
its light and easy to handle
these are considered boutique tubes but i think theyre popular for a reason
i intentionally got the jf02 after reading positive reviews all over the net
no worries about using this with an expensive instrument
a very nice addition to my collection
i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice
so you can save money on that
dont waste your time with this
two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes
paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal
i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick
a little to thick for my style though
i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way
other than that it seems to work well
the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable
i dont know about the
first lets not expect 500 double 1634 sound from a portable 9v amp
nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks
just a solid little mic holder
its light weight and sturdy
the display is easy to read and easier to use
affordable and comes in many colors
ive got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed
this is not a great quality microphone
it will pick up ambient noise from the front but thats to be expected
if your looking for the best
snark claims that its their best tuner yet
ive used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints
what can i say these are great patch cables
but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem
others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys
kind of flat and lifeless
what they sound like and play like is the most important thing
i am extremely impressed with this great guitar
very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing
i might modify it for that
turns out they are talking about a completely different item
maybe 5 times in my entire career
i will edit in the future if necessary
the average price now is 15 and over
i mean they are not computer speakers or anything
the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddysounding
great value  highly recommended
i used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems
all in all 4 stars
i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar
i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great
any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can
this is a very nice guitar the finish and construction is high quality
can be fixed with some oil
holds it in place and are of high quality material
no matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound
it works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas
i bet marcus would kill with them
yeah theyre more expensive but theyre worth it
the switch is also loose
they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification
they do what theyre built for and are as described
bought this hosa pedal cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal
i wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals
they do what they are meant to do
something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning
i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
ive used it a few times but dont see the benefit
its getting the job done and i havent seen a better option
the g and the d were fine
i decided to return it
still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit
recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue
the big 34selling point34 about the mm is that it has a top boost
its sturdy and very portable
if you are doing more than just fingerpicking you might want to add pickshield
so i was dieing to feel them
id buy this again for sure
i taught myself to play on this
it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews
this just was my choice this time
the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak
piece of plastic with no bracing
the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths
sustain is very good as a result
so i have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars
i do not hear any external noise
for sure a good buy
i just wonder what other people have encountered
some items of gls work great others are awful
but these pitch blacks are not bad
ill definitely continue to buy this brand in the future
then later used a boss tu12 for years
ive never owned something like this before so that was annoying
being from tampa i wanted my first guitar to be a dean
this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan
ive played 6 strings 12 strings bass acoustics and electrics
i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking
just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel
these are excellent music stands
i needed a cheap good quality mic and this fit the bill
the straps have petabs buckles and are easily adjusted
again i am more than satisfied
should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz
the neck support cup goes through that hole
probably good for strumming but not good for lead
this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie
its a hangup of mine
it is bigger than i had imaginedits almost the length of an iphone
steel strings only  does not apply to nylon or gut strings
this mic has amazing quality
i like on stage stuff
nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop
use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work
it will sound a lot better and its not too much more expensive
i think everyone has used fender mediums at some point these are no different
i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway
a solid favorite around my house
these replaced the etb92 nylon tapewounds i tried
the resttray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments
this pop filter is great
i use them for rhythm runs and even lead
its hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect
this is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound
i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly
i urge you to purchase if you are looking
i imagine it would work great for lead players but im a rhythm player
as you move the distortion knob higher the sounds gets more and more animal
the balance between quality and price is good
great pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through
this was my first guitar
the name martin says it all  has for manymany years
why are these little elliptical end pins so brilliant
i feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient
the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 75
the metronome feature is also a nice addition
this tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly
they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing
some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit
i will try to add pictures when i get a chance
and this thing is loud
i am definitely proud of this product
the cm2 sounds great in both applications
works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass
its ready to gojust plug it into your laptop and start recording
anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this
this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions
i like tortex and this isnt but
it mutes the violin to a reasonable level
i like the flexibility of this microphone cable
the snark sn1 is small accurate and easy to use
they trust their users to read the freaking manual
we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people
ill update how i hook it up
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
not cheap  but worth every cent
its just not as good as i expected
i use daddario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics
and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing
i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul
ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion
when the president gives a speech the sm57 is there
not sure how to rate this tube
it has served its purpose and i use it nearly everyday
im surprised that the maker of amazons popular at2020 would go this low
any guitar is better than no guitar
you can stick it to the guitar
of course they will be elixirs as well
they feel goodsound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set
unity is around 8 oclock on the level knob
they normally go dead in a week or less
so i am very happy with them
a great item for the price
for the price you really cant go wrong with this guitar stand
3 find a converter from barrel jack to 35mm jack
that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book
its compact and great to use
pair this up with a pedaltrain board and youve got yourself a sweet setup
the outs are trs style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back
i only use this as a tube amp for vocal
that means you have more green stuff to buy other things
it holds your condenser mic very solid for a worryfree session
the padding is also excellent and comfortable
the difference is that 160 can be modified by the user or left asis
they are a sturdy but lightweight stand
cover them with a sheet or something
theyre pointy so theyre good for fast picking
small improvement but not close enough
i installed this saddle in my silvertone sd10
im buying 3 more and it will work only with this
oh how life changes with a baby
but it did the two things i wanted it for
i got a couple of these
it is pretty good quality and durable too
the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless
i use a keeley in my live shows
bought another for my strat
it has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all
the behringer at108 along with my fender amp gives me plenty of performance capability
perfect for clear loud picking
it definitely stands up to their reputation
its a very well designed capo
the martins are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball
this is a wonderful item that really works
i cant say i love them or i hate them
it is so simple and so reproducible
best sounding of all smooth on my fingers
for under 20 these little tuner is all you need
well made proven over decades
at 8ohms i still get good volume
the foam is obviously of good quality and its plenty thick
if you cant find a container and add your own sponge then buy this
you can read my review on that item
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise
however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate
leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel
i would give 5 stars but the manufacturer should provide more information
these are stiff thick and heavy
so far now they sound great feel great
not sure why its not
they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in
subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing
solid yes adjusts to right height  yesit is perfect
im pretty crafty and really like this
because you like the tone they provide
highly recommand this for anyone needs pick
ill add it back to my own collection and upgrade the electronics
these picks are sturdy and wont break that easily
i think the ac15c1 is actually a better blues amp
i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound
i am thrilled with the starcaster
would not hesitate to purchase more of them if i need to
i definitely will be using this seller again
can double as a mic or boom stand
great stand for the price
you have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well
truss rod is behind a nice body color plate
easy to play and they sound great
they are not too stiff nor are they too soft
im serious try it before you die
the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors
it was my backup amp for a qsc gx5
this one is not so stiff and is very well built
i have tried few picks textured mallow color and this bright green
ok this thing is cheap
if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you wont be disappointed
i know that is just insane
i dont play with a guitar below my waist
the weight makes it more sturdy
this was exactly what i was expecting
nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy
60 dunlop tortex is perfect
i will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp
ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly
three knobs to control tone level and distortion to get that perfect sound
i have an epiphone dot and i installed a bigsby v5 on it
just in time for my first lesson
ill still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well
intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot
so now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works
why have to remember to carry spare batteries
this filled the bill works on basically any type of guitar
most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb
i have a lot of pedals
so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest
finally i found a long strap for my new guitar
this one is good just that i regret paying so much for it
these strings have made me a daddario customer for life
theres no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song
for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase
theyre a whole new world
high value for low  risk
you dont want your instrument plummeting to the floor
theres nothing better than these strings
cost a lot but well worth it to me
there are tons of effects
ive had hohner racks before so i was prepared
you cant beat the price either
the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some
the ebow is a crazy concept
i had a boss rc3 looperit involved too much bending over for me
blues blues slide rock metal
ill keep using them just maybe in a different gauge
still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer
i had the boss looper with 2 pedals and it was noisy on playback
it works very well and is very sturdy
a new battery didnt resurrect it
best to have a noise gate handy
they seat snug and enhances sustain
well expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan
i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment
the civilians wont notice the difference
it is not that long but no complaints
i cant get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe
theres no such thing as a best string
it is definitely one to consider and the price is not that bad
this tuner is spot on every time and super fast
whatever i didnt like about them got drowned out when i tried electric
but ive broken two of them
until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders
i am glad i did the tone is great
they stay on in their cases
im very happy with it and will buy more as i need more
it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though
do they sound as good as a 5k gibson f5
its boss so it will last forever
in the beginning i had problems
the best part is its not at all complex to learn the features
i have used fender medium picks since the late 60s
nice inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem
unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item
this is one of the best pedals i have on my board
this is a pick holder
also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones
if you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you
it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off
but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle
so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to
this is a wonderful product for the price
but for casual use this one is completely fine
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrivedistortion
great foot rest its not flimsy
ive owned a halfdozen led music stand lights over the years
trust me ive played for 13 years
using my dremel tool i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit
it is made of aluminum not abs plastic as another reviewer suggested
if its not the highest quality stop complaining
i bought a ukulele  to give as a present
they made my cordoba c5 sound like a more expensive guitar
i will update if that matters in the long run
this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours
if youre a metal or hard rock player dont buy this
i always keep these around during string changes
hopefully this helps some who have posted questions
this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them
very light but sturdy and is portable
and of course they sound excellent too
i was concerned when i first open the package because of its size
use it every week at gigs
went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive
the audio is always clipped
different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use
it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power
heavy duty but soft on the shoulder
its a great buy in my opinion
even if youre starting out you should tell the difference right away
i bought the case for the case not for the included harps
whats not to  love inexpensive and does its job
a flanger is also not really advisable
i can see my reflection perfectly clear
it is lightweight and feels sturdy
other than the strange color they are good picks
the thing is built like a piece of s
i made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress
kind of aggravating but no friggin way would i ever use another string
i will tell you my wah pedal story
i use it for my small solo gigs
not a issue with manufacturer but dont drop it too hard
it is cheap and very has a good range of tone options
in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder
you can connect an ipod or laptop to it
i bought this to 34daisychain34 two small kustom powered pa cabinets
this pedal is beyond loud
the blue stuff will be more than enough
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion
large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place
also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly
more expensive is not always better
it does the job however
now thinking about an eminence deltalite 12 neodymium speaker in a 1 cu
this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic
i didnt realize they would hold large tripod stands
it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy
and it just looks better without it
this is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player
that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience
i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it
i am in agreement with others that state this is a musthave
planet waves makes good stuff
good quality and doesnt cost very much
needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application
the metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable
it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more
heres a link to the extendo optionlevys leathers mmgxl25brn strap extender http www
why is it even there
excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend
they were always losing their picks
the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling
i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated
i bought this to keep the saliva on the mic to a minimum
you really cant go wrong here
many options settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile
again you will need a noise gate
the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set
popped one of these into my hartke lh500 bass head it it sounds great
these strings sound super awesome
i like the soft sandy feel of these
but there is no counterweight here so its best used at shallow angles
keep up the good work
if not then the fishman is more your speed
be advised the low e string is thick
this capo is expensive but i have never found one that works so well
schallers click in and you know they are ready to go
all in all a perfect buy for the money
this bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly
the cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines
this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging
even the light picks are thicker than the 34thin34 picks i had ordered before
just had to unfold it
i bought a power supply never looked back
not a warranty a guarantee
just ordered a shorter stand
analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce
use the cloth often to polish my guitar
too bad as i had high hopes
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s
he found exactly what his guitar needed and at a good price
i love the tone of this pick striking strings
why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe
i do not recommend this product
i play lead and rhythm
nothing else ive tied it to has seemed to work out though
the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable
i havent had any problems with them they installed just fine
this pickup sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically
perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties
my friends say duh oh well behringer is built cheap and is junk
just like my taylor only louder
item body is plastic rather than metal
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
its inexpensive and does what its supposed to
i recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal
quite a few people are complaining about the buzz causedinduced by this
well see how long it lasts
great picks would buy em again
i ab them both one after the other and it truly was quieter
this amp is for you
i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs
i cant make that claim for prior speakers ive owned
its just hard to get a clean sound out of it
i use it with distortion and overdrive with good results
you can eg your amp to compensate for the difference
my stomach doesnt feel wrenched anymore
these are heavy duty and well made
it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component
all adjustments keep position well
sturdy enough for repeated use
for under twenty dollars pylepro cant be beat
ive never owned one before this
sound is not so good
my guitars sustain was definitely improved with this nut
this compares to my other compression pedals i own
im a songwriter and record my own demos at home
i think it sounds fine
its a sound that many would like to acheive
its speaker is a 10 inch 8ohmspecial design fender
youll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter
i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them
the first things to upgrade are the pickups
these are nicely made and the one i bought is working well
bottom line this is my favorite headstock tuner
absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp
036 respectively which i can feel as well as a slightly thicker b string
the cable shipped fast and i couldnt be more pleased
this was a good choice
i gig and record with these
i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner
they are easy to use
this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini
they have a good amount of bass
new firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects
the metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program
friend loved it very much
i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications
a fine product that i expect to last for years
the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well
i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china
these days on my pedal board i have several mxr micro pedals
good medium picks decent feel and sound
the vibration mode is really good
just use a smartphone to record stuff
great price and should last long enough
either one is not good
hey  stop reading this and order it
a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this
it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out
the tuners are kind of choppy
and if the mistake is due to amazons description returns are generally postagefree
especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isnt stock boss
if you play rhythm dont bother
the cons definitely outweigh the pros here
these harps have no volume
my first time using it but like it alot since it works good
replenished my dried out fretboard to likenew condition
probably not needed on this pedal
it does and it does it well
otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound
fair priced and i love the color of the green ones
overall this is good but not great
for the  should be more dependable
i use it with the medium dunlop picks
i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead
easy to take with you or set on a small shelf
its sounding nicer that way
good deal for the price
its flawless in quality and doesnt give any feedback
this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling
i just purchased an electricacoustic epiphone ukelele today for my chiropractor
i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal
it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly
but heres my issue the distortion is not crunchy
i use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner
so i dont see how you can go wrong
i would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars
but its a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter
and the sound expanded beyond my expectations
dont let the term 34nylon34 fool you
im really happy with this pedal
i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different
she has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome
at least the hardware in this one is up to spec
i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less
ive yet to use that mic again
as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years
this audio interface is fantastic
the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it
keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks
its a well crafted instrument
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar
these are well made cables with 90degree connectors which is exactly what we needed
even so would nothesitate to use that way
the sound is deep and heavy which is exactly what i was looking for
it is very easy to use
maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain
the tube screamer just works
the cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument
82 wouldnt have bought a case for most of my condensers
we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one
anything can be knocked over but this really works better than you might believe
there was no perceptible delay
you want it come get it
easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones
easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments
while waiting for it to come  i had to change one
end up losing them verses breaking
it acts like a vice in a woodshop project
powers up to five 9v effects using one power supply
considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds
recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig
does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it
it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory
recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low
incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes
ive been using these picks for eight months and they last forever
clean bold and full of smooth overtones that work well
since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the dd3
with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound
fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for
recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar
threaded fine and its heavy enough for any mic youve got
even if this one doesnt last ill keep buying more
a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact
here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
this little stand is great
on stage i prefer microphone boom holders
unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging
they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect
those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion
im very happy with this set
there you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them
these strings are well packaged and easy to unroll and string on my guitar
for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use
considering what you get for the price
their tone is great and the nanowebs feel nice when youre playing
a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient
if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed
instead it was only 2 cheaper than buying at my local music store
i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it
spend a few more dollars it is worth it
i have several epiphone 335 dots and a gibson es335
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
i have a small 714 hat size too
the tone none the less is very usable and sounds great
aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal
this headstand works like a charm
the mic does exactly what i wanted it to do
use this to record my guitar on garage band
these mic stands worked perfectly
in this set i especially like the 4th string at
that aside these will greatly improve the way any set sounds
this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though
the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well
and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products
a good quality cable at a very good price
some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho
excellent value and you know what
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
i find my left hand hitting the lever when im in open position
its all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn
it also has a headphone output 14 inch
youll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc
that said it works fine on a nonradiused ukulele
not much of anything is worth the money these days
it feels reliable and without adding noise
can tune several different instruments
my friend has commented on its bright color  youll never lose that thing
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
they make the notes sound like bells
it is not cheap but it is well made and useful
eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve
these are the strings for takamine guitars
i installed it and it worked
when they say fits soundholes from 3375  35 they really mean it
the action is set perfectly and i dont have any issues with buzzing strings
it is rather heavy and i like that
but all in all works well
update 8212   ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric
so given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem
goes great with my guitar too
smallest cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find
and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone
great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to
this is a very nice dynamic mic
there are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out
overall well worth the price
continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry
i have a fender jazz bass standard
for the price the honeytone cant be beat
the classical musicians in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something
not my pick at 150
keep it up technology gurus
no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it
because it is cotton this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps
my tone knob has never been more useful
great for the desktop and vocals
leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible
does exactly what you want it to do
i compared it to other poly straps i have and its ok
if youre uncomfortable dealing with eq this might not be your best bet
it seems like there is a short in it somewhere
good item for the price
these are the best celluloid shellcolored thin picks around
listen to the voice of experience grrr
now im stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings
first off im no ukulele expert
that prevents a lot of damage
these picks were a good deal
i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo
these are great tuners and they look great
use very little of this
they are a wonderful product
this bridge has more strength and solidness than the original
it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily
only for indoor really light use
it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it
this is a great tuner at a reasonable price
overall great deal for the price
i spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away
not much i can say about a standard mic stand
not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased
still this aint bad for the pocket change they charge
this fender tuner is a great alternative
just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag
the tuner has an autoshutoff function to preserve battery life
very well built cable and so far no hum at all
then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware
cool design makes a big difference in you audio
i am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar
otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed
also they are offered at 40 or 50 so its simply a better value
id go back to elixir next time
but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip
still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job
in a chain running into an amps input there is a slight volume increase
next i proceeded to adjust the intonation
they provide you with an activation code after you register
these elliptical pins are great
thanks for such a great price amazon
im just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone
im a long time daddario user
i buy this cable for my dj system and work great
i recommend trying it and saving some cash
easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight
very good sound and quality
it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on
this is a very well made product
i could carry on forever but you get the idea
adjusts easily and holds its position
i use this stand for a smaller 50 watt fender amp
i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap
i just prefer analog all the way around
the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good
good luck and good music to all
and i think they will last longer
its got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance
the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesnt alter your tone
would and will buy again and recommend
then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck
it has some fun effects
it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too
ive used elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again
it is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings
holy guacamole you guys this amp
again the overall tone is fantastic
comes with everything you need except a drill or a screwdriver of course
they are ctls so im a bit confused
they are not strap locks
i am very happy with how it performs in both situations
the leather is very soft and flexible
i bought this for my taylor 714
i used the screws and it was an easy install
i just looked at pics on the net and got them close
sturdy and a bit weighty
the items appear as pictured
for 30 bucks this mic is great
if you can find this for less at a local shop go for it
i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
the factory battery lasted about 1 hour
medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me
had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong
i would not recommend it
why buy this after the experience of the others
after taking my guitar lessons
i keep hoping ill find something it does work well with
this is very affordable too given the high number of effects it will supply
i bought 2 and they were both of the same consistent quality
2 put a preamp on this
basically i use this for everything except winding strings
great for lead playing and with small fingers like i have they feel great
i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly
i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was misswired
seems really sturdy and well made
very rich bass that really comes out
that makes it fairly useless
i was able to match exactly an authentic original univibe sound with some adjusting
the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go
this daisy chain worked very well for me  no problems yet
sounds much better than listening to the pcs normal puny speakers
this mic works better for some people than others
even with that little extra expense youll come out ahead
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive
when my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced
i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats
i really like all of them
the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful
its just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper
this one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap
for ten bucks you cant go wrong
compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board
amazon has this harp marked down to about the 25 level
i would recommend this to anyone
the ampjack is chromemetal backplated to the body its not coming loose
i wasnt expecting it to be this nice
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
this amp did a good job for its rating
not a bad price either
not one product has let me down yet
i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr
nice and bright so i can clearly see it on stage in the dark
works well with my marshallhas a lot of feautures and is very versitale
everything on it is very adjustable which i also like
very pretty and nice quality
i thought light would be the better route but now im not sure
gibraltars model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time
the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights
i like hard picks and these were the ones i needed
great for carrying with you
i would recommend these to anyone
this is a must have just buy it
it also makes the strings feel nice as well
in the c windowsinf folder there must exist two files wdmausb
have no problems with this
but over time this starts to disappear
it is just very wasteful for the cost
i kinda think i am
other than the color theres nothing wrong with them
just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you
they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and im not noticing any extra noise
quality and value so you cant go wrong
but the reviews were telling a different story
dose not cut in your shoulder or back
its really overboard in a way that i didnt find musical
i like this tuner as much as my sn8
i own several of these and love them
so by all means buy these on price but when you get your items
weve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo
should make a couple of different sizes
twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping
excellent classic rock and lead tones
i cant really explain why they just feel right
comes with wall anchors but i usually look for a stud to mount on
these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive
this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording
you can buy one here on amazon for about 15 bucks
am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43
bottom line it extends the life of my strings and thats always good
the strings dont break either
bought to tune my bass
it doesnt have much value on your belt clip
i also have small fingers and hands
using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic
these headphones are almost perfect
this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now
the only thing i dont like is that the housing feels cheap
its a boss pedal  so it is rugged and reliable
as of now this is my favorite piece of gear
this is built like a tank and should last a lifetime
you can count on planet waves quality
as soon as you press down its on
the hplp switchshifting into hp is almost like a gain boost
ive only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well
i am amazed at how good the strings feel now
short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do
this versatile tool does what it says it does
they send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
they worked well and were easy to install
it should not be a problem to you or your guitar
the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged
for the money i have no complaints
this cable works perfect for its purpose
i can take or leave the kill pot
nice to use to muse your violin
for the price it is worth
its a darn guitar miracle at 40
i order this for my glen burton cutaway
the colorcoded end balls help with the restringing
i pretty much thought they were all the same
i bought this to use on my fender pbass
you cant go wrong with these were ordering 8 more pairs
i would rate the sound 5 stars
honestly i cant tell them apart since i threw out the boxes
this cord did not work right at all
i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either
this is the first harmonica i ever used
go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s
this a solid performing unit at this price point
very versatile and built in boost feature is great too
they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds
there is a volume knob but no independent basstreble adjustment as on other monitors
the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease
i love these hanging hercules guitar hangers
hardly any breaks considering i get the thin ones
if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else
i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim
turning the odrive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle
this is simply the ideal
why i waited so long to get one i cant say
this is an excellent product
it is a different feel if not try half rounds
interestingly this is really the only usb 20 device in this range
it is not that large and really organizes my instruments
a good moderately priced guitar stand
it does the job it was intended to do
it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means
basically this is a niche tuner
worked perfectly for that purpose
thank god for the website that had this on a blog
they are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap
that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive
the vintage bbds mxr vintage delay morley 70s echo for example just take it
i use the cm2 if i want to play dirtier and for covers
its one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product
it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios
stop reading this and order them
i lost like 3 already but hey theres more
be careful with the load you put on your amp though
they are all bold and in your face
i mean  the range rate arent as broad as others ive tried
its got some good features although i dont use them
best mic in this price range by far
i recommend this mic for vocals
but for speakers or other static applications theyre just fine
i wont have to listen to them
once i got the hang of it i had no problems
i own dunlop kyser and g7th nashville capos
i had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom
these have been ordered for a couple of weeks
i would probably say it exceeds your expectations
another strength of these is durability
for me these lightmedium are exactly where i want my strings to be
all pieces that were advertised were included
univibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting
highly recommended for frequent string changes
im going to be honest i have a cheap guitar
easy to work with and also easy to find
from a construction standpoint these are remarkable for the price point
very fake cheap sounding phaser but its all i need
i couldnt understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldnt work
could be more tapered for such a tiny pick
they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version 65
so far so good not perfect but good
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
it doesnt obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner
the quality is good and they look and function well
im sorry i bought it and i dont recommend this pedal
although the machine itself is good the accompanying documentation is awful
i am thinking of selling my bass
durability wise ill lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out
dont spend 200 on a boutique pedal  get this one
you get the best bang for your buck with boss products
it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff
this is such a nice bag for the price
for lead i needed to use something harder
its like im using actual studio monitors
this is the only guitar ive used them on but they sound great
these sounded different gel picks
way to stiff and small for me though
you can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volumewah pedals
the tone feel and bend is whats important
it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp
i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic
but its been a trial  error for me
im an amateur sound tech
and got burned for it
i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter
just place it upside down
the improvement in tone is in all the right places
well you get the picture
tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially
when playing an electric 34bodyless34 violin that hurts the collar bone
it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe
for some folks this will be fine
my favorite strings for 30 years
only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer
the simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat
i think the amazon price is the best youll find
the head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config
wanted one again so found this one and bought it
sounds great for my telecaster and my stratocaster guitars
the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens
good height comfortable id buy it again no questions asked
this is not a bad product just not great
only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline
also i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to
setup was easy and quick
back to the drawing board i go
theres no buzzing and it stays out of my way when im playing
i will order a smaller size
they work very well on the floor
i bought these to fill the dunlop 5005 pick holder that i also purchasd
get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun
these cords strike that balance perfectly
if you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well
youtube these theres loads of videos
but is a well made product if you use it for what its for
good value for the price
its run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me
and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer
before i play i run the cleaner over the strings a few times
i was purchasing from my local music store through amazon
this also provided a additiional 3434 separation from the wall
these have a nice sound
seems like a nice pedal
at first i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss
theyre elixirs you just cant go wrong with elixirs
also the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated
i seem to have bad luck with electricacoustic guitars when purchased through amazon
many people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone
going from manual patchlevel to banklevel is awkward
best packaging i have seen and for the price dont order just one pack
you can use delay just not with very rapid repeats
its does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
that requires a cable longer than 6 or 1 foot
set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect
i prefer 12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands
i guess this is a decent description
dont expect it to break anytime soon anyway
this is a way to go
it stays in place beautifully
i bought a cheap 34 guitar that sounded really bad
i got this from a direct from china vendor
the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out
the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent
i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar
its a tad pricey but all in all well worth it
nice and stable  no issues  works perfectly
it may just be my style
if anything they feel worse than regular strings
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there
for guitar bass or keys
they are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems
so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables
its light and feels comfortable when you carry it
everything works exactly as planned
this runs from my guitar to the pedal
works and it is good
these are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer
that doesnt make this valueless
i just got these to collect not to use to play with
he really likes them a lot
best recorder for the money ive seen
fit and finish is quite nice
it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac30
what can you expect for 20 tho
this is a beautiful shock mount
now what to do with these other knobs
they last forever and do not lose the strong holds
i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour
i can get better string control compared to other strings
unlike the bad monkey this doesnt have an additional mixer  cabinet emulated output
its a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive
i have these on all my guitars
i have been using dadario strings for 30 years
anyone else noticed different color leds
youll probably have to break them
wonderful setup and i highly recommend it to to all martin owners
since they swivel my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks
still enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use
the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well
it is second place on my list
expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time
then a volume knob a tone knob and thats it
very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out
it also works great for any instrument or sound system
these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance
i have always been happy with the planet waves products
while a motu ultralite for mixing  tracking is plugged into the xlr connection
got it to my door for 304
but it does the function perfectly
these strings sound nice and you cant go wrong with the price tag either
please note that im not a newbie to this stuff
no to all the above
i always have a set in each case
directions dont include the proper details
i know i often do
thanks amazon for a great product
you cannot even get a backpack for this price
the supplied mini usb cable fits nice and snug
makes me wonder how ever played without them
i bought this specifically for a gt100
this is my first real recording microphone
here are the reasons  solidly made everything is high quality
another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic
after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved
bought them to replace the old 34vintage34 style knobs on my lp clone
so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model
folks this is a stellar device at a throwaway price
i actually had to send the first one back because it did not work
if you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect
i bought this along with a clayton large glass slide
i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band
it doesnt require a loud volume to hear the tone
however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot
im a beginner and can change my own strings so im proud of myself
this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier
my kids were excited to split this pack of picks
the sound quality is surprisingly hot
i just toss it in my gig bag and im always ready
best thing ive bought for my ipad in a while
for hifi music recording however youll notice it is a cheap mic
same setup same hardware etc and one person can have wildly differing results
i would recommend this to anyone
hello musicfriends  this is built cheap but sounds great
so far that was an ok decision
i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained
got mine for under 130 and its a great mic
very smooth action when using the vibrato
great for bending and awesome sound
im very happy with it and it works great without any problems
the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite
i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick
purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that
i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers
its always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place
great fender quality for a great price
first the natural finish is what got me started
this takes up at least the space of 2 pedals
all in all im happy with it
way too small maybe like a third of the width
works like its supposed to
as the title it works the way its supposed to
got this stand to mount a studio projects c1 condenser mic
73 mm is right for me i really like them
not much to say about a xlr cable
the fit and finish seems like quality also
i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity
mounted and this looks like a solid product
heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played
these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily
allsteel frame construction feels sturdy
im impressed with what you get for the price
all in all a good value for the money
i especially liked the unreleased version of for your life
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another
it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional
first impression of the guitar was terrible
1540 people like itwho am i to disagree
i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets
ive had this for almost a year
these should last a lifetime barring any physical damage
i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also
i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not
i like the jim dunlop
i just wasted away 40 something bucks add shipping
worthless and its now holding my sons 34 size classical guitar barely
just finished setting it up
researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the shubb
great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly 6 or more picks
for what its supposed to do it works very well
i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it 5 stars
im a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords
so things just roll around inside case
on guitars it sometimes doesnt register on the low e usually moving around helps
this would work fine for drummers
its lightweight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck
narrowing it down to daddario and elixirs
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
but the tone can be a little harsh so i got these
ive used this to connect several devices and the colors help
but this tool is very well designed
this little device is more than worth the money
overall product quality is good
these did the trick fine
i like the spray bottle applicator
pro co rat2   great dirty distortion pedal
it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass
if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc
it was my favorite capo
after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase
these are nice easy to use capos and the price was great
i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up
seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width
i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine
it attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar
as rotosounds and theyre only a jackson not a bad string
i love for my practice rig
id rather lose one of these behringers than a 58
have not broken one yet
well executed black guitar strap
with the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here
and now my personal debate continues
cheaper ones will work but i wanted to try it out
gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop
buy thisthese pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny
well they were a great investment
and drive another speaker cabinet which bugera also makes
the tuner works quickly and reliably
no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness
cheap easy to use cuts sound 70
has some nice rubber on the bottom
it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars
these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them
they all work great and of the various models i prefer the sn2 red
more versatile than the sovereign
i sprayed a little matteblack paint over the epiphone logo
i like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack
can tune up quickly every time
dont let that keep you from checking this hot rod out
i put these strings on my guild acoustic electric
might be a little to tight for checking intonation
makes changing strings a whole lot easier
i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds
turns out this is an amazing amp
first let me tell you what this pedal cant do
i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something
but compared to a buddys roland and solid state ampeg its downright mellow
ive used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting
the highs are very tinny
the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning
this guitar will make a player proud
i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc
i had to send it back for a refund
next time ill go for a vibrant color
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product
nice big lugs to solder to
connect mics ipods mp3 players
i recomend trying one out some time
this is a great guitar for the money
if theirs better ones out there then i cant wait to get one
a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords
these really arent a very good value
these used to be expensive noneessentials but today theyre small accurate and portable
this handy little device will fit perfectly in any outoftheway spot on your instrument
i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps
be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar
its worth spending a jackson imo
as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal
grips really well in your hand plays like a dream
both are going to be used for years
lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos
clamp it on the head turn it on and tune
meh these things are what they are
yes this may be another tube screamer clone but its a darn great one
one just cannot tell the size from the picture amazon has
im using a ts808 in front of ocd
i am happy with this product and will order some more in the future
2 thumbs up and 5 stars
a very good deal at 15 clams
however my back was still hurting and im definitely a weakling
correct me if im wrong
if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise
see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool
i have a tech 21 bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs
when im in a apt
slash from guns n roses uses them
the screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time
both of my snarks have broken off at this joint
the tones are warm and welcoming not as sharp as with other strings
if youre only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware
for me the mic has been all its cracked up to be
fx on turns on a little delay effect
first of all i love the crybaby 535q and i recommend this wah pedal
you can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds
will purchase more as needed
durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color
personally i prefer the snark tuner but these are a fairly close second
these are the best tuners for the money
it does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant to
i admit i havent had it long but so far so good
i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar
i have five guitars including two les pauls and they hold them just fine
good service product packing and delivery time
the heil pr40 is pretty good but doesnt have any onboard eq options
the wider clip spreads the stress out
i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings
they were already worn out
i bought the special 20 pro packkeys ga  c
pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings
if youre expecting an sm57 then buy an sm57
the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v22 peavey valveking etc
i like a cheese pizza
just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen
great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars
it is smaller than i thought it would be
i guess thats to be expected for a light pick
im a huge fan of elixirs
im a man on the move and am constantly away from home
i hope this helps your decision
these heads are amazing and a very good investment
great pedal for the money get it
also worked great on my 6 strings
the line 6 spider iv 75watt combo was the perfect solution
im a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only
i think youll be pleasantly surprised and you sure cant beat the price
its not the ole clip it and go capo im used to
enter the joyo jf09 tremolo
yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue
works well with the axl pg515
but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open
this pedal is not new to me
these hold up great year round
the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable
for that application it works fine and sounds great
sweet and warm when the drive is down
id give them 35 stars if i could
im using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation
the bad the driver for this thing is horrible under windows xp
crisp tone distinction is just not there
i really cant think of anything negative to say about it
tilts to match personal requirement
you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off
fighting stubborn leather openings especially if new
this item does not work and is a total waste of money
i see no flaws on my banjo
they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price
these are great  have 3 of them now
gives you virtually unlimited sustain
it is exactly what was described and it was a good price
no regrets on the buy at all
nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat
its a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection
it is highly informative easy to follow and has some good songs in it
if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case
you get the bright booming sound
i can get 4 completely different sounds out of it
ive always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards
nice quality at an unbelievable price point
i bought a few years back and its still working amazing till this day
all of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience
my old bag had more
i bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good
built in tuner works great
im sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop
this company dunlop gets it right with the mxr line
the builtin mic records very well compared to those tiny handheld monorecorders
it has the perfect balance of flex and strength
i am very pleased with the quality of this stand
they sound good to me
what many people call 34bright34 brilliance is the opposite of 34dull34
most advice ive seen says try em all and decide for yourself
its cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much
i love the luster and shine of new strings feels nice ans springy
keep a couple of these in the bag as spares
there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments
after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic
i bought two for 10 bucks each
better deal if you dont just buy one and have to pay single shipping
again they work but theyre not aesthetic nor elegant
very pleased with this purchase
he was happy with the cradle guitar stand
but i think he played a little bigger uke than this lmao
i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used
takamine makes many excellent instruments this included
this is a very useful tuner since its small fast and pretty rugged
really impressed with the polyweb
i got this and switched over
with this little gadget there is no guess work
the stand with my guitars looks awesome
these will now be my default locks
i got these for a partstele i built and im really happy with them
very cheap and great for price but recording with this isnt the best idea
some people complained that the handle doesnt work
mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit
ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound
now this guitar is a joy to play
i sometimes play in a park or outside around the bbq
simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp
i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs
let me start by saying im always on the quest for great amazing tone
not so good outside if there is a fair breeze
since its based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise
first of all this is not the best microphone ever made
and i love using the word snark
these martin strings m170 arent bad
the other one was not bad i lasted probably 10 years
tripod base to get over stage cables and a boom arm with clips
it has a cool name but thats about it
lush is the right word
i like them very much
some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking
my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try
i will continue to use it
they may seem pricey for picks but theyre still not that expensive
pedal is not working it just making noise
the ead are that tall capstans and the gbe are the shorter capstans
i cant imagine not using it now that i have it
but you will find some gems too
very happy with this purchase
call me old school i hate the packaging
the normalmidcut switch is part of why its a great fuzz
i bought two sets 6 total great cables no added hum
now on to the guitar itself
try to turn it up and you get bad feedback
this fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along
protects my string from dna
if youve never used this stile picks you wont be sorry
the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible
ive read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage
i am now dedicated to these strings
these dava picks are very nice
i also ordered dava 6024 grip tip guitar picks they are nice
though my playing still isnt very strong  the capo still is
still this is a good deal
pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily
ill be looking at additional items from this company
you can dial in some pretty lush tones
it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically
i thought they were crazy
for the price this is one of the best pop filters
you can get a lot more for your money these days
good string action out of the box
my guitar i guess but who cares
they were a perfect fit
this is a very useful product at a fair price
the characteristic strat sound of my guitar is very apparent
i also put a pop filter on it
i was turned on to this and i was truly blown away
they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end
but the bx5 performs we well or better than i hoped
i feel like i might accidently break it off if im not too careful
it stays in perfect tune now
so for that many kind of modes barely useful
after all whos playingand getting paid for it
all in all this is a great product
seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt
they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks
you will not regret it
012s ive been using which i think i liked a lot better
the instrument just doesnt have enough power to carry some types of music
i use tortex guitar pick of that thickness
just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string
the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them
donr be fooled by the imitations
hopefully a better make will put out something more roadworthy
ive been using this for roughly a year now and it works fine
this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and doubleleather ends
great accessary for yamaha keyboards
im using these on the mandolin
it only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying
put this on a gibson j45
it is pack very well and i use it everyday
it doesnt have a onoff switch but thats minor
other than that this is a great amp
got the mics from dealer fast
very easy and simple to use
a good instrument is worth protecting
this product is great i use it after every session
got a cleanerpolishwax type ointment for every part of your guitar
before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches
too expensive foronly one effect at a time
love the thing so far
the capsule is surrounded by this truncated conelike metal screen enclosed on all sides
this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build
value for money it cant be beat
the pickup is very over sensitive
it has a durable feel to it
the digital reverb has a spacious feel
they rock and i feel they are the best strings around today period
are my behringer eurolive active pa speakers as good as my mackie srm450 speakers
i am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes
we purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the ukulele
tried all sorts of things oh brother
too much noise with one spot
i scored a virtually unused preowned unit for 50
makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half
can hold up to 11 picks of
works wellseems to hold up well alsotreatment lasts for awhile
im very pleased with it and recommend it
active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely
i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board
it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar
it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles
ibanez ew20 body not neck dimensions  w 16 d 5 l 20
if you cant make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acousticelectric guitars
i will be set to go
its a very solidly made stand
this is a cheap guitar in every way
plus the price is great
i love this little item
arrived as promised in a frustration free packing
i love this cable they look good and are well made too
the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings
im not sure id use it for professional gigs but great for home use
to be clear  tube amps sound like tube amps
much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level
i got this for twenty bucks shipped
well what can i say
ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitars neck
same with the metal amplug
got what i needed  a basic capo for a good price
but for 20 dollars its well worth the price
this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed
exposing the delicate printed circuit board
pretty much defends its self from the old 7080s songs
in all actuality its a really simple design
though  i like the kyser the planet waves triaction is super slick
it is identical in every way with the retail store product
it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too
mine was still brand new to me and worked really well
i may have simply gotten a defective one
ill also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision
it doesnt sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest
ive got a mxr mc404 cae for my concert line pedals
installed with no problems plays pretty well so far
this is my second black suede leather strap ive bought from levys
so i bought this shoulder pad
plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs
the ability to control it with an external pedalswitch
the anchors stayed in the wall
it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness
i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc
i havent jacked it up all the way
so i wasnt choosey about the colors i got
but the pedal itself not for me
you will always get quality from vic firth
fit perfect to my taylor t5 and no cons i can find so far
i almost sent them back
ive always been partial to
update  10132012 update of my 2010 review
arguing over tuning can really take up time
this product is a must
i wouldnt recommend against this product
unlike a nice 20 pound amp the chord wont pull out
they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job
the use of the device was moderately difficult
they are also very accurate i hear things just the way they are recorded
i bought the abalone ones because they look cool
i want them to be slick when i bend notes
very clean sound very versatile
jams and festivals bluegrass folk whatever became seas of intellitouch tuners
to have a midi in and not be able to midi syncquantize the looper
very happy with these strings
i dont expected nothing better this is just right
you really cant go wrong with a set of these
id read a lot about the one spot power system
put it up on the table when your picks are not in it
with fretted basses id always liked strings with a little brassiness
ive never received a bad stick from amazon
i would get this stand again
recently ive been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the
running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound
i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele
the weight is great for my style of playing
but had no idea if this would be as good as all that
this strap is sturdy and robust and its plain black
this is where the balance control is very helpful
but works perfect for me
i bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases
it just sounds weird and unmusical
and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweighthollowbody electric
first i love these picks and used them exclusively for years
does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do
this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp
i enjoy this very much
picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly
dont be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better
the pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also
not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot
the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship
very easy to use and lots of extra cable length
i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day
it came today like the computer said it would
the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours
for the price this stand cant be beat
they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing
plus this will look good on camera
itll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing
this is the best mic for its quality and its price
fender accessories 0733150406 pure nickel electric guitar strings custom are very good
they are good quality and very durable
i choose this rating cause it is the best adapter ive found
id recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there
it does its job reliably and well
this pedal really hits the spot
spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere
its easy to use and see
with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process
fender makes good cheap ones
best of all the price
good tone but dicey controls
the pegs line up so they drop right in
good strings with good sound
im using 18vdc to supply power and it deliverys a fat overdrive
very happy going to order more
the strings are with out a doubt real fender strings
i bought this boost to use in one specific situation
a little goes a long way
i am amazed by this amp
this is a great gig bag for the money
the seller did not fail me in any way
the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it
and that one doesnt look like it will live very long
can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 23 hours
would buy these again ifwhen i acquire new guitars
it was brand new unopened in box
i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and its the same
i have a martin hd28 with the large grover tuners
one star short of a 5 star review
highly recommended for the occasional strummer
the footprint is small  meets are needs well
they do what theyre supposed to do
this is just what i have been wanting for a while now
i definately helps cut down 34wind whistle34 on my mic
with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised
i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic
i use it for practice and recording myself
i was able to connect it to my pc
a very boring dull uninspiring pedal
you can tune all strings in same time
you cant go wrong here
it works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror
this large pick  barely goes over my thumbnail area
dont listen to the whiners
i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs
a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar
this corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out
i still write all my songs on this and play it more then my
worked perfectly for my needs
i would if necessary purchase this item again
and the price was right
just to name a few
overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals
it is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs
very easy to use  clip on and go
they are comfortable too as far as ear pads go
second elixir phospher bronze last was daddario
as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list
a definate must for any guitar player
he absolutely swears by them
great at this price too buy several
you cant beat the price
i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar
i love these  picks  im  defintley getting some more
excellent little device for the money
these strings sound light and bright
pickups far less than inspiring
good tone good sustain and they stay in tune
this guitar is probably one of the best i have ever owned
and with 24 minutes of looping time thats just crazy for the price
my les paul is heavy
lets get a few things straight from the start  i love effects pedals
sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent
since the headset has a monomicrophone this adapter works great
a simple affordable instrument cable
does what it says it will do  keeps your strap locked on
a lot of which do not sound to digital
this unit is of high quality though
working just fine so far came quickly in the mail
compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal
they are inexpensive and they work
i received exactly what i purchased and works as it should
does it damage your instrument
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
very well made  strong
i leave the choice of that to you the reader
i drilled into wooden studs
i installed these on my 2000ish epiphone les paul
ive even used this on matte or light finishes with good results
it does its job and does it ok for my taste
its much better than what i got with my violin
youll find it in this pedal
youll end up saving money over the long haul
i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs402b mini stand
and look like i make very good choice
i like this so much i bought 4 and going back for more
all good in their own respect
but mine seems dead on
a lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade
i used to work for line 6 so i know modeling pedals
those are the best ones anyway
tension wise at d standard 1156 is ideal but 1152 is doable
i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price
all in all they both are the best of all the ones ive tried
this is a fantastic product that is well made
this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks
was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this
kudos to amazon for posting this warning
this is a good product
its all the same no squeak slick jazzer mellow in tone
i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip
well made and the perfect length for my needs
things like strings and picks are subjective
unquestionably the sound board was far more sensitive
is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point
definitely glad i bought this
and really any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes
it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it cant
as expected from hosa another great product
they arrived well packaged and not loose
i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones
at this price its kinda like the amp itself  a no brainer
it didnt smell like the other reviews said either
they are about equal on volume
the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb
this cable works fine im going to buy a pair in january 2013
this is a very useful little device
the picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order
strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in
the guitar touches the floor
these guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing
i bought them at 45 dollars
doesnt sound good playing fast
the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet
if you use various guitars on gigs this pedal is very useful
as always this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy
i would suggest going with the black for this reason
i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews
the amazing thing is that the switch from intellitouch to intelli wasnt gradual
the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable
the primary draw here is the bright lightup display with wide color bars
these hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended
one constant high pitched screeching tone
the gray dunlops dont look anywhere near as cool as these
im not unhappy though this stand works quite well
dont hesitate to pick one up for yourself
sounds amazing in any combo
the sm57 will pop like mad without one
consider it overpriced or rather undermade
being a studio owner i didnt buy this for stage work
it fits my line 6 jtv variax in a very cozy way
seems like i found a winner
and it mikes well too by the way
i bought this eq pedal to use with a 70s amp project
it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords
almost annoyingly hard to get one out
sounds better than the ibanez or boss models  warmer and less processedsounding
the stand makes my setting professional
as such i found them to be a reasonable value
its thinner than i thought
the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable
this dunlop 5005 pick holder work good
but these are as advertised
to my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum
i used it with live 8
i am so extremely happy with them
very sturdy well made product
like the title says ive been using these for years
these are the absolute best picks ive ever used
ive been buying gear from alto music since 1980
75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off
for the tube amp snobs
i plugged the guitar to my old crate amp and it sounded pretty good
i love these string swings
but for now does the trick
good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery
right out of the box everything about the instrument was spoton
im really sick of these amazon substitutions
cons  a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass
like all boss products it will probably last longer than me
love it the display is cool and cant ask anything more
there are a few more different models and brands that are good
the stand arrived very quickly
but i havent bought a guitar cable since this one
the nylon is very strong i do not see it fraying in the future
wow is all i can really say
the cleans are ultra clear and the rock tones are amazing
have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them
a great sound in audio recording
might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad
i love the picks the tin they come in and the ease of use
assembly was pretty easy and took little time
i decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls
its like the blue blocker sunglasses
they just arent quite my cup of tea
this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software
even when detected by the software it will not work with line 6 equipment
quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather
but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style
i am so glad i did
for what i paid i wont bother returning them
these are one of the best strings ive used
these strings seem to last longer than the others ive used
i decided to trythe dunlop formula 65 polish  cleaner
this is my first petal of  any kind
he would not send a warranty replacement
it takes some doing to figure out which does what
im not sure what else to say
the gig bag is a square and softly padded
a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up
add the limited lifetime warranty and gibson support and this guitar cant be beat
its your guitar on steriods
musicians gear tubular guitar stand black pair is a good deal for musician
fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off
yes and for good reason
im planning to keep it for years
for solos itll boost your mids and your signal
the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box
they are solid durable and reliable and cheap as well
want a really good china
it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound
this single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects
i bought this one to replace a shure 8900
which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment
anyone that wants a nice versatile pedal this is the one you want
with no additional outboard gear if i didnt want
its very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar
im mounting it to a heavy duty on stage brand double x stand
manufacturers website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar
super vivid easy to see color
sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose
over all  this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag
013 which frankly i cant feel
lastly the old standard dyna comp
i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there
i wouldnt want it to be my everyday acoustic tone though
i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up
i would buy fromthis company again
these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings
works great for the price
i didnt want to spend 600 on a wah with a rack
i would recommend this and the quality is good
against a spyder iv individual tastes will vary
and i feel that way about music
the capo itself is really good
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
my son loves them for metal
this is my first mixer
i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal
and they look professional too
i never really got a chance to play them
they are tough well made and simply work and sound great
okay but i have a pickup want the mellower tone sans finger noise
are there better locks out there
0 6 7 9 and 12 are amazing voices
for 50 there is seriously no better deal
ive used more than a handful of usbfirewire interfaces over the past decade
looks great in my fender squier
it is what it is
the tone has continually improved as ive broken in the speaker
there are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers
we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time
for the price the functionality is excellent
i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries
i have them for my guitars and for my mics
it is easy to use with one hand and does the job
quality product at a good price
these will save you a few minutes
i bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great
as for size its designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars
theyre easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound
overall its a great deal
what are you waiting for
i wet it before attaching
and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us 100 worked
but i will order more
this purchase is the very reason why im looking to buy a wireless system
thanks amazon for this product sale
the samson tech support was friendly enough but not very helpful
works with multiple straps as well
ive used these strings for longer than id care to admit
measuring is best with a cooperative assistant
it was a great choice
when they break i change em
lots of bang for the buck here
plugged it in and it powered my rode nt2 condenser mic
it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many
maybe they will last longer
even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable
i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different
cant go wrong for the price imo
bright display easy to use works well and cheap
lots of sounds in this unit
my primary instrument is electric bass
i reach for these first
this amp has tons of power to spare
i tested it with other tuners and its right on
add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus
oh well i went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead
in the past its always been a crapshoot regardless of brand or reputation
i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom
indeed this little bluelighted wonder will make you famous
this one is a winner hands down
i never realized how dry the wood was
it is very sturdy and stable
id buy the neotech simple sling again
so far they are great
this has the most distortion
i liked them better than these
this educational device is truly an asset to all musicians especially guitar players
im extremely happy with the build quality and performance
got no complaints over these
they fit perfectly on my schecter hellraiser
believe me you figure it out at this price point
very good and very useful device
how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me
it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport
at orange county and amazon
it is my first condenser mic and at 149 it is a steal
the thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression i played
this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought
i have a strap ordered and on the way
i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone
this mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our studios here at
ok 6 trs patch cables 6 long each for 3000
this new ns triaction capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively
easy to install on the guitar
but this is a case of you get what you pay for
these fit the american sized pots perfectly
just the design man go planet waves
the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed
thank goodness amazon doesnt sell this gadget for the fortydollar retail price tag
i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard
but we dont know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain
be forewarned  this pedal is gigantic in dimension
i normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal
by now they work really good and no interference where detected
a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
it is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others wont
these cables are wellbalanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass
is this the best digital delay on the market
so certain compromises have been necessary
this is a musthave item for drummers and the wellorganized
i was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes
in sunlight its too dim
they had some great 34spank34 and sounded great
the tuner is perfect for me
much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before
check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing
they last and they stay in tune
its very easy to install very straight forward to use it
others have commented on the cost of this capo
the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return
first of all i am a beginner
the newest pair live in my gym bag
very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician
if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap
yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends
ive never heard a bad tone out of mine
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar
after researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever i chose the fulltone ocd
too soon to tell if the sn8 will hang in there
hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and youre set
your really cant beat them
the cable works fine and is very flexible
light weight compact and all in one tool what more could i ask for
update  the letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly
pick it up and carry it around itll come apart and scratch your stradivarius
i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp
and yet the price is the best part of all
these strings are really quite good but i wouldnt call them perfect
sure its old school rock distortion
your tone is made up of many many variables
one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings
wish the phase came in a different case
its very sturdy and well built
no way to send it back im not from the states
if you try them just make sure to give them time
for the price its a must have
these things last forever for someone who only plays casually
if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups esp
just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting
cant go wrong with this one
they are an excellent value
i use some threadlock on them
but this will be my go to bluesrock pedal for quite some time
been working without a problem to this day
leaving me with the same music and way less background noise
i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
theres a great video on yt from proguitarshopcom that demos it very well
i should of bought this a long time ago
they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot
probably will never stop buying them
they just dont get any better than mxr
from simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all
lack of any impact resistance  the bag has no padding at all
its a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well
the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges
they were great and incredibly handy
otherwise id highly recommend a more expensive model
this cable filled the bill perfectly
from stern to port this instrument shines
the modulations and delreverbs are well done also
one is its height adjustable and two is the tilting head
hope they work when they do finally arrive
i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables
the guitar just stays in tune now period
i buy one of these for each guitar
i would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose
it sounds good and seems to be very durable
these are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard
i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tonesustain
honestly to protect this better theyd have had to contact tony stark
i recommend this to anyone with an astyle mandolin
these are such comfortable picks
fresh strings do sound better
hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling
very forgiving on technique also
this is a nice small amp
wuhan makes great products for the money
and there are multiple sound options including phantom and instrument
is it a completely authentic acoustic sound
i hit the tone button and all that is done for me
just try not to get the labels wet
this little wonder though is fantastic
also these picks have a noslip grip
it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz
perfect chain for most rock sounds
bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well
this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case
its small barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back
it sounds great it works perfectly and it was 40
i deduct 1 star because the loud feedback
but some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle
bonfires sitting around the house etc
true bypass means no tone suck to boot
the product description seems to report a weight of 85 ounces
and the price is great
i plan on using them as backups in the studio
awesome tuner really fast and responsive
purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings
the leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary
they work perfectly and havent failed me once
there is enough in one bottle to last a very long time
you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly
dont forget  practice practice practice
would buy again if given the circumstance
finally it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch
we all know its just a container with a sponge in it no biggie
you wont be disappointed if you do
there are much better sounding metronomes out there
but it does the job and its well made
this one appears to be an exception to that rule
this worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet
this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues
if bon scott only knew
bought a couple of these to build preloaded pickguards for strats
hopefully more reliable than sn2
it was in two words masterfully made
solos just sing on this amp
i would purchase this again
found a method done by another searching online
im using this as a di box for recording
no big deal i just tune it at 12th fret
he clearly was good with an ebow
its cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard
try reversing it and youll see what i mean
makes the fretboard feel like new but best to clean with alcohol wipes first
the same is true for every note
but i set mine up for a few effects i use live
it does not sound like that in the recordings though
as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more
i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly
at first i almost couldnt tell a difference between having it on and off
its performed flawlessly since day one
very compact size and easy to use
i decided to try them out
until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them
they use it mainly to sing along with their cdsmp3s
that is they may sound soft and cheap
it really put yout guitar in tune
he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use
it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together
i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment
not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints
you cant get better than this
behringer is the way to go
in some cases ive decided something else sounded better
i got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars
it is an extremely well made and solid product
if it didnt have this fizz i would give it a 5 star rating
plugged straight into my bass amp for home recordingpractice
it will bring the extra juice you need
felt comfortable even with its larger size
not much of noise and practical carry
does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type
i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio
im using the guides to replace factory guides on my strat and tele
i have these on several of my guitars and i love them
this box is small but packs a great punch
this is just an excellent product
no big deal really unless youre a real tone freak
my violins tone doesnt change much at all with this mute
when i first felt this strap i smiled
it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range
i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c1s
my first guitar ever i am happy with it
one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals
mxr built like a tank
ive been buying these strings for a while now
or it could just be in my head
its 2 what did you expect kevlar
high recommend this to any stringedinstrument players
easy to use and accurate
generously ill give it 2stars
heavy duty base lots of adjustment if needed
i use these on a deering goodtime ii and they work well
holds my picks in place  nicely
works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars
the athm50s are really solid studio headphones
they are solid sound great and this packaging of them is excellent
it works well for its stated purpose and appears to be of high quality
very cool gadget and well executed
cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele
if your looking for an small amp
id say it started to cut into spyder jam sales
i use this on my 310 taylor with a kk pure pickup system
btw thats all i have to say so dont make me type more
the string cutter works like a champ
i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better
the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of 34regular34 cables
adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
the only options are the drywall anchors
these picks are really hard and last forever
the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore
as a guitar player i recently march 2013 started to play the uke
then i got into guitar building and they all got put away
a great value for your money
paired with the zero hum ac adaptor its a highly portable amp setup
it also has a substantial treble boostlow cut going on
the pedal works as described
and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface
i thought id try something different just to see the differences
it is so simple and so reproducible
no need to over tighten the adjusters
plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor
yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space
i get compliments on it
flash forward  this thing kills
very simple and works very well
that should make me about 58
moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool
ive been looking for 34the34 portable amp for some time
this is the one you want
gives a really broken sound
item arrived on time and as described
nice and warm and lush
i find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars im currently playing
planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff
these strings are beyond amazing
but wait a minute hold the phone
i put new strings on after using this and man
or the picture is a bit misleading
works great and no noise
these are a little course for what i wanted
pluck a string and it will indicate what it is
having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal
i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install
this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one
this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal
most modern devices will do just fine
how many of these types of noise boxes do we need
see my customersupplied photos at the top of the page for examples
without the excessive hum and almostunusable tone control this would get 4 stars
fits my tenor uke and violin just fine
i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one
a three star at best
based on physical condition i would recommend this product
great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar
i dont know which one is more accurate
i dont like a pick that is to stiff and i like the grip
overall build quality is very nice
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless
simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines
its a boss its solid  and a great price
mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar
the case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy
they have a long range and great sound fidelity
absolutely a 5 star value
more profit in someones pocket for marketing jargon
after a week im already playing songs and im not a string player
i plugged it in the outlet
very clean quiet and durable
they add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk
the looper is really why i bought this pedal
they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome
ive seen an awful lot of products come and go
nice sound for a nice price
it works good and that is all i need
i move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly
make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60db of clean gain
and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo
nothing like those 5 cheap straps
this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion
once they did communicate they were very unprofessional
these didnt show up so i contacted amz which goes back to godps
the result is an amazing clean boosting eq
nicely sound it gaveup on what brand of strings you use
all joking aside these heads really are great
but its a nice cable
my guitar was made in china which may account for the darker hue
well made like a tank
everything is solid as a rock
this stand is very good
put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier
i didnt have any problems with either of the three supplied cables
these are easy to install using the instructions or without
if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner
some peope miss the 34quack34 electric guitar type sound from these other types
it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast
also the 34feet34 dont spread as wide apart as id hoped
this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes
consumers require choice but with the shure sm58 there need be none
one bottle should last you a very long time
buy this and enjoy it
excellent build and looks great
this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine
i dont regret my decision this pedal sounds great
and is much better quality
i also purchased a musicians gear   http www
lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body
bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design
the feel is different and the sound is different
they always give me good picks to use
60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic dunlop pick
that said the digitech express xt is a little better
this pedal sort of let me down a bit
some of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic
i have one of these and the amount of detail is great
quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well
i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward
im glad i tried out these daddario strings
its something ive recently been regretting more than ever
provides a cool bright clean white light and will cover three or four pages
the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele
they work very well for my needs
if you dont have one get one
if you can wait for the delivery its a no brainer
the price its about right
all guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there
it came in nice packaging
i have had and tried about every compressor out there
bottom line you get what you pay for
this was another filler item for a much larger order
its built to last and solid as a rock
the feel of suede is hard to beat
beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare
i like it and it was well under the price of others
like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style
the detailsthe amp itself is tiny
i keep one in each guitar case
better than going to the always overpriced guitar center
they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time
looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars
its a dinosaur but has a great tone
i could have used a baggy to hold my picks
its red when out of tune and green when in tune
fit my 12 string with no problems
seriously for the price these cant be beat
i think a smaller kit would have been better
no its not the most amazing phase pedal but its still quality
that is just unbelievable in my eyes
honestly i would get the hybrid slinkys over these
i use it for guitarvoice solo live internet music shows
this is an attractive leather head stock strap
the soprano one fits great even though its a different brand
now i can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2
very good sound quality plenty of gain
frankly id forgotten how musical this pedal is
win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes
these daddario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking
i wish i had found this amp sooner
it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly
i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input
it ends with a spin on 14 in or a standard 35mm
really is a great buy
ive had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it
now i dont know why
this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider
no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use
these are a great deal
these picks work well and look as pictured
sixth you can add an sd card not included to expand the memory substantially
they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming
and a volume nob that goes from low to high
this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best
ive used the classic kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars
nice and snug with my american stage cables daddario is great
the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes
too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound
but the width makes it feel better till its 34brokenin34
the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them
it does what its supposed to
i assumed incorrectly that both sides were black
cost less here than at guitar center so badabing
you can just plug it into your keyboard and play
in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight
with this said over time there is a possibility of wear
nice grip even more so when i sweat
i use it on my bass and havent had a problem with it yet
it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar
they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner
and then  yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy
the sound is pretty great
the snark is great and the price is amazing
both ends are a loop
when i play faster songs thick gauge picks are very easy to lose
just barely gets the job done
the bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there
will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much
mykyser capoworks on it just fine
but come on this stuff is just fine
it seems much more twitchy than the sn1
i love it and i am using it almost every single day
i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in
luv the zip pocket in the front  perfect for strap snark capo whatever
i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon
but on my acoustics its been daddario j16s since day one and still is
nice cover for my behringer xm8500
ive seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more
made me a little cautious
ive owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards
some other mxls like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end
when i first started on guitar i put
these headphones are 100 amazing
i would buy it again
im not a fan of shaped les paul cases
i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve this
its comfortable and adequately strong
if i dont change anything most of the time it works ok
great pedal and great value
its handy having the wire cutter built into it
it cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid
with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time
a good price a good buy
they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre
i was really impressed by the sound
the yeti has it all in one package
that is what i wanted
some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks
maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean
and dont be too rough when winding or it will break
other mics i own dont have this problem to this degree
if you buy this definitely havebuy a 9v adapter with a  polarity
wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free
seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price
plugs directly to the system or my miniamp
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether
these strings are what i use on all  of my acoustic guitars
solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music
noise reduction these are absolutely stellar at noise reduction
the mat protects the guitar body
under 10 wouldve been better
its that good for what it does
just got this stand today
these make great and affordable mic cables
was using a box and this is a great help
zero issues with this cable so far
i am very happy with it and thank you
in 23 years my tastes may change
well built solid construction  zero complaints
the knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough i guess
any brand that works well at the right price ill buy it
i would put this pedal in that category
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
ever since i just bring a bass and this pedal
really brings out the beauty of true wood
phantom power and data transfer has been flawless
i have an fcb10 that i use and like great controller for the price
then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better
not only is it accurate and easy to use but its so convenient
it has a metronome which can be fun
this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries
how in the world can they sell a very good microphone for 15
us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings
it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with
the effect is subtle at best
when i first installed these strings i wasnt too impressed
as a tuner i really like it
on my electric guitars i dont like the look at all
that said  the ds1 does exactly what i wanted it to
none of us are record savvy or anything like that
else this is a really good choise
didnt care for the behringer time machine
ive been playing for 40 years
i was upgrading all the chrome on a mim and put this on
much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws
but at least on an initial run im glad i bought it
good quality cord and connectors
cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality
of course those guys abuse their equipment
they really are the better string
i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips
get it if youre a simple player with few fx in your arsenal
easy to put on the guitar
i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use
for the money this is a great guitar case
i was looking for a semisoft felt picks
this mixer is just what ive been looking for
what else can you say
both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker
for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere
i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup
im so glad my friend introduced me to this product
does not work for all guitars
you will not be disappointed in this product
fortunately it was a c1
still for the price i had to give it four stars
check out some youtube tests before buying
i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface
these dunlops get it just right
planet waves aka daddario is a wellknown name in guitar accessories
purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative
nice enough that i wouldnt check it at the airport
this is a great pedal for price
got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar
as it is its very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii
i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc
i must now rerate it with a 5 star
as with other dava picks they wear out pretty quickly
these sound good on my electrics
pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand
fit my mim strat perfectly not much else to say
so i hope that helps
delay  flanger phaser  tremolo  pitch shifter
only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all its tubes and thinking
you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock
im glad i got this thing
they were much louder and cleaner
the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping
however this worked fine as a plain tuner
usually longer ones are only obtainable
hands down the best cables for electric guitar
i bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo
the jf02 is a really nice dirtbox  and not just for the price
im pretty fond of this little guy
a great buy worth the money
hope this helps some novices i had to learn it this way myself
i bought this since i am a new guitar player
these blue steel light strings sound like gold
2  the chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough
this little tuner is sweet
that is the reason i did not give this product a 5 star
it is not expensive but the item is sort of cheap
im using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick
overall i am very pleased and saved time on string changes
the price is a great selling point just by itself
this was exactly what i was after
this system works just okay
bluray surround with the band was just amazing
super cool pedal with tons of applications
its okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new
pluck a string and tune it to the dial and eureka
the guitar is new and has the strings that came with it
pretty great strap overall and i am very very much pleased with my purchase
they have a smooth unhyped sound
ive got a 12string acoustic guitar
its the only strap ive ever used
but something as thick as an a string
they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings
it comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars
so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal
i only wish id ordered the lights
these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing
they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money
the case is plastic foam and clips
daddario guitar strings are favourite strings
i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return
i bought the martin strap to match the color
the guitar has such a great ring to it
i would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video
i was very easy to assembly and looks great
typical british growl at higher gain settings
otherwise the time machine works fine as described
i come back to purchase another
they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them
theyre very thin nylon picks
other than that an awesome amp
the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine
2012 were all 5star reviews
one less thing to set up carry around and worry about
i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster
installed as usual and tuned them
for the price i dont think you can do better
it may even give you aids
the tin is way nicer than the old plastic one
but since it does its a good place to hide a 3000 gibson 335
does it for you so you dont have to do it by ear
the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed
its held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone
my guitar would probably not be happy without it
this is an absolutely amazing reverb pedal
each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply
my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one
this orange micro crush amp lives up to its name
the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand
no noise from this cable
i am now a fan of takamine
my finger stays too tight
the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic
it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument
plus i mean come on john mother  frusciante uses them
fits all standard mike stands
shipping was fast and id definitely recommend these
switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot
bought so i could teach my son bass
these white nylon picks should last a lot longer
this proco rat pedal does not use that
this is probably the least useful part of the amp
the stock tuners have one peg  these have two
if you dont mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap
i bought these guitar picks for my son
i have an electric and an acoustic hanging up
the strings themselves are the normal color for strings
so it was something that was necessary
the metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions eighth notes sixteenthsetc
switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm
its especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming
sweet strap nice colors good quality
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner
they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great
several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound
i use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming
there is another device called a uke leash that also works well
you cant go wrong here
this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didnt
youll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches
this is a great music stand
the one i got is labeled both on the package and on the clip
very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners
the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues
without this tool i dont think i would have been so lucky
unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch
great for around the house and rehearsal
the pick pocket is handy
so for such a simple device you really cant beat it
beware that there is a learning curve to looping
this works fine on a standard guitar
i have used these strings for years and this was a great price
a very attrative complete assemblage of blues harp
you cant go wrong with these
works a little better at winding strings than the barebones winders
the truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them
i loaded it up with equipment and havent had a worry about it since
for the price its a bargain
did not end up using them but will one day
i will only every buy herc stands from now on
for this price its another great tool for your arsenal
ive now secured it with tape so it should be ok
but for around the same price you could get a fender amp
what really can you say about switchcraft they just make good solid parts
eg low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string
come on were artists so show off your creativity
i started to play the violin a few months ago
ps  look at the price
on average it eats a battery a day
this will work with my daughters ipod touch generation 4
i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms50g
on that level this strap succeeds
i recommend this to everyone a lot of product for an affordable price
highly recommended by this writer
it was cheap to buy but works just fine
no odd muting or dropouts
this is my first tuner and its great already
these have worked great when ive needed to have 14 input vs the xlr
this is to be expected at this price
only the machine heads are somewhat smaller
the shorter the cable the better for studio use
i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes
forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal
i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup
even a professional would appreciate this capo
a bargain at the offered price
multivoltage capability for worldwide use powering eight pedals and very cost effective too
for the money you cant beat it
im glad i did  what a nice guitar it turned out to be
not having a cable was kinda a big deal
consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top
so am i complaining about these limitations
there are usually two wires of differing color
i recommend this mount highly
nothing as good as even a ds1 pedal
my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one thats easy
it even comes with a handy pick holder
tried them on epi lp and a prs
in which case ill probably go daddario or cobalts
for my limited purposes this works great
best deal and does the job
this product makes your pedals super secure
it boosts the guitars signal
great pedal and amazing value
theydont get in the way when being used but look almost out of place
its so easy to apply and doesnt leave any messy residue on my fingers
he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand
but ive never played a set of this brand that i didnt like
so give them a try
my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me
i bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips
it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone
this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off
but for me these work just fine
over all a nice product
elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic
ah finally one of the real reviews
what can else can be said
less than one star for this piece of
spend more if you can
the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain
my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff
the ocd gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone
almost all of the reviews i read were positive
no mud clear mids and highs with clashing
but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low
it also folds down pretty well
i sprayed it in my bass guitars pot and now its like new
ii do replace it for guitar cable work fine im happy with this unit
overall a four stars product imo
i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon
as long as i played loudly everything worked quite well
4 stars because ive only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode
it also came with a cord
comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly
i have bought the red blue and older black models
it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise
works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten
after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved
if youre shopping for a tuner give this a try
what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss
im rapidly becoming a behringer fan
then tell me what you think grin
i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon
it was like a dry erase pad
my first one arrived not working at all
its built like a tank
honestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune
to my surprise there wasnt even any tape on it
compact size makes storage easy
easy install and great price
he lost it after performing in a play on stage
for the price and free shipping this cant be beat
i received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar
it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in
for its price and qualityi giving it a 5 star  o
are they made with exotic materials
i bought the ebony with pearly inlay
it is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar
what this produces is smooth oldstyle overdrive
that was a nice benefit
leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes
i normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar
this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable
this product is great for using a softphone or other communications program
grab a set you wont be disappointed
its been a while since last we got together
id bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt
i purchased a second one after using the first for one month
i dont even have to play the guitar anymore it does it for me
pay the extra money and get something quiet
tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar
i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin
item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set
for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex
this gauge is perfect for my 1970 gibson j50
in case you were wondering this is a clone of the boss compressorsustainer
moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward
also its a vintage style not a mid 80s mosquito tone killing device
the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed
its got some solid pres and has enough for me to work with
1st time i saw it was 40 years ago
cant beat it for the price
i knew i had to go cheap at least for now
this holder may work well for harmonica for some people
easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip
strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around
a cute little monster thats surprisingly loud and versatile
i really should get a case
it doesnt truly isolate each input
clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect
i needed a jack plate for my custom stratocaster build and ordered this one
home recording or just practicing
strings  the ones that came on there sounded great
youll be oh so pleasantly surprised
i will always have one of these on my board
this hanger was very easy to install
between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered
i thought it worked great for my needs
its like any other snark super tight tuner
yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people
the 8020 are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp
these cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp
the audio jack on my laptop was failing
like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa
the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple
i keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases
overall im really happy with this pedal
i know ill never be able to blow it away
decent strings dont cost very much
its a midlevel priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals
however now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect
will be getting the amp in a day or two
much better than a standard clip on a mic
it only cost around 60 so perfection should not be expected
puts on a good shine for your instrument
it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos
that really worked well to tune the guitar
basically this case is very sharp looking  made with good quality materials
for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
at home might sound ok
if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure
extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems
i am now a diehard takamine fan
it will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar
i have many heavy guitars
it is well worth the money
i am more than please with what i have received
i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again
works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg
it gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs
cant go wrong for the price
tonewise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which i rather like
getting the recorded signal onto a computers harddrive is expedited with the included usb
let your guitar be the judge
the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money
that comes with a solid extension arm
these slide around in my finger to much right now
but ya get what ya pay for
it makes it so much easier
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
maybe it will get better looking in the long run
its bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music
try the light if you are a beginner
in short it works great the sp01 isolates the mic extremely well
this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget
these are great for sure
i like the thickness of this pick
for desktop users heres what id do
this cable is an amazing find
all 12 were in there all of them fender mediums
that last 14 63mm of movement on each leg was worth 100 improvement
one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself
its my best acoustic currently
each of the models are distinct
love it and have one in every case
when you need an audio insert cable you need an audio insert cable
if i would have paid 20 on this strap i would be furious
just what i was looking for
change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument
i own several tube amp combo and halfstack
not the fullest tone but you wouldnt expect that with extra light strings
dont upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level
daddario strings are simply the best
the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase
i have used for few times so i dont know about its longevity yet
based on this belated realization i have raised the product rating to 4stars
unless you know what youre doing these things are too small
the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well
i tried this about 3 months ago
feels great to finally have professional sounding music
will last forever sound great
got it right b4 xmas thanks amazon
the package includes a black nylon gig bag
update   i just received another set of these cables
i will buy these strings until the day i die
someday i may use it on stage
i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming
this pedal makes my les paul sing
that is a great bonus for me
i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
joyo makes great quality products  cheap
its barely audible but its distracting nonetheless
this one surpassed my expectations
surprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it
quality company great strings great price
i bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp i play guitar
i lke these strings very much
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
its great as a stand alone distortion running on a clean amp
you just dont get better service than this company provides
i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well
however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip
not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better
a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing
and found i like the one that came with it at least as much
its the most delicate amp ive owned
this makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices
i cant believe this mic is that good
good price for an pack of pickups
this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting
i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price
dont hear any anomalies in the audio
overall some of the best strings available
although not through amazoncom i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar
i have a feeling this one will last a long time
just clip it on and jam out
does not stay in place well
i have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years
smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings
these are allparts parts quick usps shipping
it is a great buy though considering the price
they explore quite nicely that way
i bought him two different types he he liked them both
it does exactly what it says it does
if i used it a with a passive guitar pickup id want external preamp
i bought this right angle 10 red cable for my older ibanez guitar
if it is the pickup will mute the a string and its annoying
it does exactly what its supposed to do
effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion
after playing a while the set started to feel more natural to me
tis makes it a little awkward to carry
overall impression  the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives
not cheap quality at all
our buy two more of these they are only 20 bucks
removes those annoying popping ps out of your recordings
the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it
both models cost about the same with the pm05 roughly 20 cheaper
marshalls based on 59 bassman without the delicate touch so theres no wonder
not the best pedal out there but for the price
through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear
it did fit my kala katg with room to spare
much to my surprise this cable is pro quality
the only down side is that it doesnt come with an ac power adapter
plastic attachment clutch and extremely thin gauge metal
the first 3 saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down
i cant say its bad
the display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever
this system does not fail
it comes with a cord that has a standard 14 inch end
so far so good with this pedal
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele
this is an iconic fuzz pedal
with a twang twing twong nothing wrong
usb only provides 5vdc and phantom power usually requires 1848vdc
the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever
i would recommend it or purchase again
the couple more that came in had a wider slot on them
overall i have to say that im satisfied with the fender polish cloth
i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag
they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break
for me this is perfect doesnt make any noise with my conections
hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall
beautiful solid tone and no buzzing
why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job
but to my luck i found out what the problem was
rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off
i think ill be putting one of these on most instruments from now on
actually i bought two of them
for now im hanging one on the wall with this and its fine
the strap that came with it is no great shakes either
the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time
i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion
the korg ca1 also cost slight less
there are several reviews of this product on you tube
i ended up switching to a vintagetube overdrive by behringer
only five watts yes but thats still enough to fill a room
simple to use compact and well built
i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do
update ive lowered my 4 star rating down to 3
overall they are just not as good
compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard
i wholeheartedly endorse the product
just nothing with the name joyo on it
it is easy to use
cant go wrong with tortex
heres where you get those strings
looks more professional and i like that
there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat
its good enough not expensive
but i dont think youre getting 5x the sound quality
this is a nice little pedal
and hes pretty picky about his guitar strings
there is pretty much little to no latency and it isnt noticeable
great price for excellent sound highly recommend to everyone
i tried another miniamps but all sounds like toys
tough to even strech this into a full review
this stands up and holds the microphone in place
i guess all my other cases just dont measure up to this one
i am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading
id give this levys strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible
this mic is absolutely awesome
edit  6 months later and its dead already
it just might not be your sound
i tested this capo on several guitars and with one exception it worked well
much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned
for guitar playing i use it in close proximity on a desktop
crystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console
it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone
when using the mxl 24 usb in win 7 no driver download is necessary
othewise i would still be thinking about this one
sound wise these are great for their intended purpose
she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics
never any complaints from me
as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that
it has truly elevated my playing a few notches
behringer has done it again
i use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp
not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund
i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great
it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes
its ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected
this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool
im a pro musician and music teacher
im buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables
i used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month
the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze
behringer hit a home run with this one
martin knows what theyre doing
i wasnt expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner
this is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture
with the mute it dropped to 6db
i have had no problem with performance
it is sturdy easy to fold away and easy to setup
i made the r28 c11 and c12 modifications
this is a great stand for your violin or viola
it stacks well with the ep booster and another compboost in the chain too
it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not
ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitars
i like the tone of daddarios 8020 bronze strings
the master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular
you wont be disappointed it is worth the price
which you may find here dunlop ergo pickholder
that wasnt necessarily the case but there are other problems
im very pleased with the unit
i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on
i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar
its extremely wellbuilt and performs its task very well
in other words great all around
outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with hossen
more than my other guitars again not a pro
very cheaply made but does the job
would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but
i have 4 of these so far will get more if needed
i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught
great for beginners and experts
it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table
i put dark nail polish over the led bulb
i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt soundhole cover
however at 10 a piece i have to give it 5 stars
i think every guitarist and bass player should own one
this pedal however is going to get some serious use
ive bought a number of these for use on my pedal board
got this for my electric guitar
pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to
if you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals
wouldnt use anything low quality for that guitar
the free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter
great for old school rock and roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc
people are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish
certainly if he did he never patented it or anything
elixir polywebs were the first coated string
i let him kick that pedal on and off all night
i also tested it with audacity in recording my voice
ive used the boss rc20 and the digitech stereo jam man
i had the replacemnt in about four days
the mic has loud voice in my karaoke
this is the neatest little light i have ever seen
there is also one available that looks like a guitar
cant miss dealing like that
im powering a zoom ms50g and a fulltone ocd
its good overall but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me
overall  i like it
the finish looks very good
it is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly
consider taking my advice  treat yourself
for me it was a good perchase
nano is small but quite durable
the sound is clear and crisp for its size
and it will sustain your notes
good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length
if its too muddy you can add treble
what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it
i dont like these too much
the onboard monitor volume and headphone is fantastic
i would not put them on most martin dreadnoughts for example
plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general
the metal musthave will be in the family a while i can tell
youre still getting a good deal
makes a perfect small studio combination
to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe
its okay to soak the wood as long as its momentary
i was surprised at the sound that this amp produces
so easy to tune with it
matches perfectly with other boss pedals
it does a fantastic job at that
good product after you get it assembled
hard to believe this was so bad
my fingers keep hitting the strings
ive been playing guitar for more than 20 years
it will make any strat or tele build shine
bought as a gift for my son and hes very pleased with it
it came extremely well packed
the spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high
but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion
look at what it does and what it costs
what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish
havent used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
it has a lot of power and noise behind it
in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists
if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this aint it
sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved
so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand
the pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust
let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that ive tried
i use them on all 4 of my guitars
the pins measure  28mm or 1 14 inches in length
used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started
i currently have 8 pedals setup on this board
ive been buying cheap stands and im never really getting what i want
which can dramatically shape the overall sound
the nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear
just put in a 9v battery and it works right away
i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays
i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal
i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself
but not that big a deal
hes not a big kid so even 15lb
theres nothing complicated about this purchase
if you need this get it
needed new strings but everything else was smooth
holds my seagal s6 very well
but its not a distortion pedal its just an overdrive
ive switched to using the builtin compressor in my digitech bp90 instead
second time i bought these
they are very nice looking and functional too
this is our second one as we both have guitars
lets have a go  im glad i did
i may have to tape it down to keep it in place
well be buying these for a long time to come
accurate little accessory only works with guitars
the buzz increases in volume over time
i dont miss the amp at all
the presence knob isnt a midrange control but does boost the upper mids
you will not be disappointed
this is indeed a 6string ukulele
it sounds incredible and at this price its unbeatable
like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable
if youre not using a pedal board these are just what you need
di am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however
this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings
the box is very good quality with nice large controls and metal foot switch
my old pair of jbl studio pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost
got the danelectro wall wart for it
the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar
these work just as well
i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews
this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price
the are certainly ok and play fine
i am a tone freak
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
the flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal
an excellent value for the money
so in light of the competition the focusrite looks kind of ok
it is part of 34my sound34
small enough to take along
get it you wont be sorry
this thing should sound louder next time ill buy a duncan pickup
very solid build never felt cheap in any way
i use drums so nobody else gets hurt
these are well worth the money
these do that much better than schallers and the fender ripoffs of schaller
i highly recommend this tuner
stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal
this was a good purchase
but i wanted more of a standup doghouse bass sound like early basses had
then he grabbed his g7 from the car and let me try it
the fit  finish speaks quality
i got both hi and lo g sets
the sound of the ukulele is great
i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake
no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there
i have tried other picks like this that had points which went as confortable
dont like that its difficult to change the tube
i hate having to drill a hole in my guitars
which is not a bad thing if thats what you are looking for
just works so what else more can i say
they are durable and have a nice tone
of course i just got it
comes with a power supply
this pedal is an audio swiss army knife
doesnt cost 11000 dollars other
i play in a really loud metal band
this stand really isnt an exception
a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband
seems like it draws current even when its off
what the crap are they talking about
onoff so im not sure how you can rate them as poor
sounded lovely for the first hour thats why two stars
if you want to get the right effect this is a good choice
three big ones are the jet sound choralflange and leslie speaker
the sn13 is another great snark chromatic tuner with a super tight display
it is lined and has a pouch for song books
i considered a few different brands and even other line 6 pod models
but im sure something better will appear next year and until then
its easy to use clip it on and go
daddario xl nickel woundregular light gauge exl110bright round wound
trust me on this one
i took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared
despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me70 does have features that recommend it
took me a while to figure that last one out
however these power slinky strings are great
this is a handy little tool
play on guitar rig and amplitude
i really like the new container
which is yet another step forward in highquality home recordings
i bought this to tune my 12string without using the end jack
dont go for this for modeling
air conditioning can do the same
my other favorite is a dean electric 12 string
i could immediatly tell the difference in both feel  sound
elixer definitely still has the edge
also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel 2
i bought this during the black friday sale
its simple well made and works great
you dont know how good youve got it
no buttons levers or knobs
cable looks great  feels of high quality
manufacture said its for practice to me it serves the purpose
otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups
i warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and yes
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
fist off guitar center had this for 29 bucks
ive been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase
ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars
solid four stars despite me personal opinion
i cant believe the one they sent was so short
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
what more could you want
the sn1 is a musthave as far as im concerned
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable
worked perfectly for my latest guitar project
it would be great if it had a steel shaft
three positions roughly correspond to 18 19 and 20 inches
tone control didnt work so it was returned
great idea though and the price is right at 25 street
i am very careful how i adjust and have had no problems
no background hiss very good clear sound crisp no distortion excellent transmission
for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need
ive never had a problem
i wish it were brighter and easier to see
bought this on a whim
maybe you want a 34lofi34 sound
one must grant its largely a matter of personal taste and expectation
even without a boost i can use it for death metal
the price is great im planning to have several of this
might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasnt done by shipping
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
so if it isnt attached the the guitar it wont work
i dont play enough to need changes that often anymore
this box is no exception
they have a nice stage presence
i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month
for 99 dollars  quit looking at other wah pedals
most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man
and im so glad i did
a nobrainer as far as i can tell
73 being my mainstays for acoustic  electric picking
the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory
these cables are just what i hoped they would be
fret work is top notch
it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt
very portable though the holder can be a challenge at times
this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely
this pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds  and is very versatile
oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixirs
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
this is the first time ive used the dunlop straploks system
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality
i also wish it was an xlr connection
great value and price too
the daddario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price
i purchased as a practice amp
i guess i have tried about every type of pick around
if you have any vision problems the display might be an issue
i think i saw micro and thought shorter
but this is the switch for that amp
not good if you were using it in a performance
the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones
elixir has excellent quality control too
no need to replace these pickups
my taylor is much louder now that i use these
i appreciate its compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock
pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly
maybe they corrected the problem if one exited
this is an amazing amp
good to keep as a spare in the gig box
ive never heard worse strings
plush interior hardware looks great and good quality
sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string but generally works great
and with 12 strings it really put a lot of tension on them
has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars
this little gadget does the trick
it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have
that also means a bigger readout
my piece arrived in a week thank you very much
he is another cool use for this pedal
my stand doesnt tip over like the others
this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price
15delivered is about the cheapest priceanywhere
i just received these tuning machines today
ive been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011
it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning
i am very happy with the purchase
this works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws
i use it in front of my shure beta 58a and its absolutely perfect
looks great on my blond tele
the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar
only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds
in livepractice situations at high volumes it doesnt bother me much
the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks
with flatter eqs it is fairly noiseless
focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this
im a semipro player and this tuner is all i need
the interface does not match the rp 255 and has a lot more provisions
for the price it cant really be beat
in this respect its like an mxr 6 band
just got it so far so good
they are light on the fingers sound great and priced right
seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason
tutsplus dot comtutorialsbeginnersguidetoacoustictreatmentaudio1274 just replace the dot
but i would use no other tuner on stage
fits perfectly in sound hole
the other one is shorter
it is loud and the screen is easy to see
the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light
010 sets and they are good too
simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all
for the money it costs it worth it
after using the better pickup the amp doesnt have any issue yet
i would buy this product again
the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal
i bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build
amazine that it works off a 9v battery
like these better then the bulkier dunlops
surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable
and its a great midi controller
this brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings
i dont know but i am satisfied with this purchase
i just play at home with friends
i usually use it as a midboost for solos
quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch
or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background
i just received this mic today and tried it out
not so much on a flat fretboard classical
regarding sound quality my recordings have never sounded better
this is very ruggedly made i think it will last for ever
i own a total of five uca202s that i use in different locations
i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy
i just think it could have been better designed
since i have better equipment now i havent used it as much
easy to use and very accurate
the plastic tension section just snapped off
if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed
as just simply an amp it has more power  as good of sound
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
great sound and stays in tune
i dont get excited about the latestandgreatest very easily
i own hundreds of picks
the sm7 was a redesign of the sm5
lizzie wrote back and said shed take care of it
in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability
i have always liked daddarios packaging
thats a win for the customer because it decreases the price
not too long not too short
a lot of harmonics and output captured
i have no idea how itll sound with a solid state amp
they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great
i have used this winder now 4 times
not sure about these picks yet
output of high quality material also sounds superb
they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion
so its like that guy who asks for a lighter
even the acoustic sound is majestic
been golding up an 88 strat plus that has seen better days
for the cost you cant beat it
for the price you cant complain
despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc
ha amazon rejected my first review because i mentioned a competitor by name chickens
i think youll be satisfied
i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program
if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely
i dont know why others rated it as a 4 star
i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only
the title says it all
i feel like i was neglecting my guitars until i got this
i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand
used it once but once was enough
ill update this review after ive had some more time with it
this capo however just works simply smoothly and its a great pleasure to operate
it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel
sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me
i cant speak on the claim for a longer string life
i started using these a few years ago
your uke is going to come with crappy strings change them to aquilas
the vibe sound doesnt get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2
once you setup your pedalboard
whichever set one ultimately chooses cant go wrong with the qualityprice ratio
i have two sets of these for my straps
this is a brand ive come to trust
its kind of an 34empty34 sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects
update   downgrading my rating by 1 star
i accidently bought large ooh boy is it like windshield sun reflector size
the connectors are well fitted
i became relatively skilled at it in short time
i purchased 2 of this set and it works great
good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano
like i said theyre nothing fancy but they get the job done
so it may not work in some configurations
i think this is my fifth behringer pedal
the cordoba is much nicer
bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic
it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional
there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking
ive given it a 3 star merely out of respect for hohner
its not rough on my neck and is very adjustable
the range of fit seems pretty good to me
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product
hi i need this item for travelling and it has work very well
ive used it for 8 months with no issues at all
line 6 please go to sdhc
i especially like the dual inputs on front
had a few packs of these from christmas
i use this mainly with a double neck bassguitar
you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc
i play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine
if it were under 7 it would have gotten 5 stars
same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap
the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly
wish it came in a darker grain of wood
the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy
overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly
hope this helps with your decision
i got the aged white
i truly recommend this one spot adapter to everyone
definitely worth the little extra they cost
they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding
see the picture and youll understand how it works
at least its cheap though
it comes with 2 aaa batteries
let me make it clear
when you solo the vocals you can tell which is used
eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasnt expensive
they ring like they should
conclusioni will be ordering more of these
christmas carols are lovely but spanish stuff doesnt sound so great imho
unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my sennheisers
time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions
it fits very well and sounds great
im using this footswitch to control a drum machine
if you gig or record and need a reverb
i love this wall hanging mount
to each his own they say
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
these 10 are not the ones he likes
it folds and is definitely portable
they must stay in our universe
flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls
for my practices and rehearsals i want to travel light
but forget hooking this directly to a pc
it is reliable and rock solid
its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly
probably the best capo i have ever had
if you dont have a preamp system this will do you no good
the lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured
i use this tuner to tune up my violin
these are very well made with the heads well secured
i am usually oneto read directions thoroughly but not this time
the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound
to me this makes it much easier when changing strings
this is one beefy string winder
as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar
its no gibson but it is a lp
because from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose
it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it
i paired them with the jj kt88s and these things just rock
they were a good price though and they fill a niche that i need
these are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were
thats what you do at home and its called practice for a reason
ive owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime
the overdrive is quite good
i switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable
they all need one more joint to adjust the angle
i like their longevity too
shines up guitars very nice
these nyxls from daddario are definitely in that notch above category
these are durable and long lasting
not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore
im going to get a squier strat instead with either amapleorrosewoodneck
i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars
also the 34pick pocket34 is only useful when the strap is around your neck
out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase
virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application
ive used these picks for years with great results
for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables
the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock
good quality xlr cable that works 100 fine
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these
i personally think this seagull is over rated
i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic
the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges
why do they sell an instrument with crap strings
in fact i sold the delay and slow mo recently
its sturdy well made and cheap
the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson
52514  i said the case had no handle well i take that back
imports often have threads other than 14 inch sae
the highs were clean and bright
i got this to help with that
the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves
forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame
and thats all ive got to say about it
after several days i felt much better about it
blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store
not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there
im sure it wont wear out any time soon either
why do they charge so much
dont even think about it
there is another review here where the user states they didnt receive enough velcro
sat on my snark  good tuner but takes some patience
wowif you need a guitar cable this is it
i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years
there is a reason they are used by so many professionals
ive owned strats telecasters cheapies an alvarez i think
sweet chorus i have the ce5 the ce20 a ce3 and this one
let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel
run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer
im an true analog guy
not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about
the build quality is fantastic
i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal
i have 5 sets to use up now damn
he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses
always buy daddario strings for my 7 guitars
frets look good and nut looks good
great feel leather matches my instrument well
this is a wonderful little looper
for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case
get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain
i dont like the soft opening
it only took me about half an hour
this amp is a ton of fun
i have had plenty of these
so far this has been the most impressive of the options offered
you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw
also it not to big
i wouldnt venture to use it on the road all the time
new to guitars but in 24hrs
things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke
comes out as easy as it goes in
i think they perform very well for the price
it takes up very little space the biggest plus
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
i needed a new strap but i didnt want to pay 20 for one
it is a must to have these
so when reviewers say its bright i say compared to what
i use them all winter long in my guitars
i couldnt see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name
its subtle but its beautiful
but it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient
you can get some insane sounds out of it
no effects loop means that your timebased effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy
nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board
but gorilla snot worked beautifully
but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new
price them at a store and you will come back here
another issue with the ca40 is the poor screen
i usually use 9s but decided to try these 10s instead
played well right out of the box
it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic
i really like the cherub pickup
see my other review for the world tour gs1 folding tripod guitar stand
they are good and reasonably priced
its worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these
these didnt last long at all
it leans wayyy too far back
the provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming
if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one
it responds to picking very well and organically
the strings sound great and hold up to the 34whammy34 just fine
great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price
very cool design and looks good on my tele
it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts
even the pop filter fell off
he hasnt had any problem with the capo yet
it cut through really well
works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas
perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size
it likely works fine for a guitar though
the voice knob is hard to describe
i now rate it at 5 stars
fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out
plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises
they are very good tuners and i highly recomend any tuners this company makes
i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base
this is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range
i have 4 on hand
works a charm on acoustic guitars havent tried it on the electric guitars yet
its good for keeping things from getting too buzzy
so minus one star for that
i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since
they are a little small
helps my guitar stay in tune
they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though
this was a bit unexpected because of the bright label on the package
ideal for gigs as well as studio and home
its very light and thin sounding
i guess they think you need big think strings to produce volume
the bag is well made considering its price
if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done
they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin
im raising my rating and the result
it is a little heavy but that is something i can get use to
the price was also very good
in the end the real difference was the price
i was a little skeptical having used other strap lock systems
the padding is comfortable but slightly heavy velcro flaps make installation easy
the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all
the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes
i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it
i use this for my desk mic i use for recording
one the back side of the strap is not black
the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies
would not hesitate to purchase this item
the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on
my old cable was stiff and unruly
thanks to amazon for the quick delivery
but im a big fan of allinones
inside of the box it came with 2 screw sizes
press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing
im sure it would be great on a dark stage
people set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall
i havent figured out which yet
100 postconsumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load
worked fine with cover off then replaced cover with new bit of rubber
it folds up easily and looks to be very well made
these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well
update  1912 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand
i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune
i would call it average
they work and sound good
the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about 45 on amazon
these stands are truly amazing
they sound  feel great
i was not sure about this at first
this one was cheap and does the job
so i did a little research
i am a converted guitar player and i like playing with a pick
meanwhile im going to buy another sturdier gig bag
just dont wander too far off
this stand is ok for light home use
since the string is nylon i gave it a chance to settle
acoustic and electric but not at the same time
like my first hosa cable this is a high quality item
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store
some people pick on behreinger because theyre stuff is still cheap
for its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playing
for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet
this one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features
if you dont mind spending the time to learn all its capabilities its great
despite that ive been highly impressed with its quality and sound
the string cleaner is nice too
how about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall
with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag
i used a manual ratchet screwdriver
i have a electric bass guitar and needed to capo
snug fit for my mic
i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more
this is a prime instrument
great attack but holding onto it is the problem
this was a great investment for my home studio
it pretty much does what its supposed to
the strings seem to hold up well
and so far i havent lost any yay
a good old standard that ive used since i was a kid
i play fingerstyle and they feel great
the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches
these are very nice bright strings
long lasting made with quality
when i mentioned light duty in the title i truly meant it
however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations
i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned
this low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked
a very nice pick both in feel and texture
will be getting another as soon as i get daughters new guitar
perfect for my obscure use
first saw on youtube video how genius
i bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price
the last thing i want to mention is the xlr preamp
im not sure what i was expecting
i bought one of these a couple of years ago
for the price they are worth it
i have to admit that this is true
its truly a one of a kind product
even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end
i have a epiphone les paul special ii with a fender frontman 25r amp
daddys never let you down
it comes with two buttons two washers and 4 screws two different sizes
it of course uses the windows audio drivers
these are probably the most wellknown pads available and probably the best
but thats exactly what i need to clean and protect my fretboard
and for the price id buy it again
great picks not just for jazz though
but make sure there are return privileges
and i still dont sound like alvin lee
update  1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong
everything i have seems to be jet black
its 25ft long as promised
best ukulele strings i have found to date
i really hope its a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful
always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases
they are clearing the shelves preparing for 11 but it has bugs
these string play good and stay in tune pretty well
overall this is a pretty good stand
if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery
i have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base
so ill update should i encounter problems
it gets the job done but it has a few flaws
boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac3
so while i got this for my soprano ukulele
at the music store i stumbled on the dunlop gator grip 20
these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used
wow i am very surprised by this pedal
then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby
probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit
speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first
i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome
i will be getting more
was easy for my husband to use
this modtone here seems solidly constructed
got this tuner for my new bass
it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats
punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range
read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal
a suggestion from my teacher
i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe
i highly recommend them especially the ones with the builtin vibration sensor
ok im surprised that this unit is now over 1500
i have more room and control with this pedal
if you want to get humidity into a guitar this product is a must
i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box
i highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars
especially when i practice monotonous scales
because its so effortless to hold i can focus my attention on other things
but thats not a problem any more
i absolutely love these picks and swear by them
not to mention that its hard to strum and sounds awful
we keep a can in every case
will hold any guitar that ive seen
ive polished many guitars multiple times
faster and more stable tuning
people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo
grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard
square pad allows placement right next to the fret
i have been trying different ones
i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it
it works awesome with electric guitar too
probably ok for solo gigs or home practice
once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner
well i was dead wrong
if you like this guage youd like these
also this was priced right in my opinion
its not super heavy distortion though
ten bucks you cant go wrong
wow what a construction its got there
if its red youre off if its green youre in tune
soi f you want to turn distor t offu cannot
if i purchase another strat i will purchase this case again
you cant really do that with this pedal
why you would almost think i know what i am doing
solid hardware side mount ac power
i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical
it fits good and came in the color i expected
90 gauge at guitar center and love them
you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters
i hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase
this cable simply feels strong and well made
this is so out there that i wont let it influence my rating
price is right for sure
this is my favorite light weight guitar stand simple and does the job
what a buy for the price
im not crazy about the plastic casing but it seems sturdy enough
im not much for brand names on my guitar cases
dont know why i waited so long
its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass
they do sound good though and will last a long time
between 7 and 13 earns it 4 stars
they sound good and are affordable
it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length
ive been using elixir strings for about ten years now
this is the perfect fit for all my basses
as the protector ages it slips off the end
if youre just starting out this guitar is perfect for you
anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing
an allaround solid purchase for the low price i found on amazon
these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
i doubt i will lose them
after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew
often times it even stay in tune the next days
i avoid this brand of cables
it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle
sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables
they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff
you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal
with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp
the 3pack is a fantastic deal
i have a marshall mg15cfx solid state amp
primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer
it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay
this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals
it sounds like its behringer
sturdy had it for a few weeks now
printed documentation is pretty lame but the included dvd is more through
it has a great tone balance to my ears
i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock
if you need an 808 clone on the cheap this is your pedal
he also bought one this morning
i debated between this one and the other popularslightly more expensive one
im not sure how 34on stage34 ready this is
so i replaced with these
im seriously impressed with the quality
certainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal i have used
to be clear  i am quite the newbie guitar player
ridiculous setup but ive save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that
you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers
sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron
i researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit
looks great and plays great
ive been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now
this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar
more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice
holy buckets of tone batman
this does not mean i will not try others
great product for the price
but if playing on the street corner is your thing
i didnt like the switches on the cad m179 either
it has held up with all the kids using it
makes the whole house safer for the martins
this is still usable but it is for very big fingers
my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism
it does its job in fantastic fashion but doesnt last the longest
i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together
youll need a new one about every ten years or so
i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i didnt
seems sturdy and well made as well
i dont drop em anymore
this is a cool little amp
im thinking of getting another because of this
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected
in fact i found it increases speed
others may feel differently i am sure
however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend
works great  great price  meets my requirements perfectly
it holds well when bumped or moved
the package arrived on time
now i can take it along and use it in europe asia and usa
so far it has functioned well and i do use it a lot
great for amateur vocal recording like me
peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners
these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on
stickies onto your guitar wherever
the snark sn5 tuner for guitar bass and violin gives me spot on tuning
it does seem like it can deal with some wear and tear
im really glad i found this stuff
i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential
the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard
ah you know im just so used to strings that are individually looped
at first glance the different tone kits dont bring much to the table
item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging
ive been using elixir strings for many years
most of them that ive owned you have to plug into your instrument
this tuner is easy to use
ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home
i bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with
warehouse deals are not such good deals
this is a great tuner if you know what you are using it for
it made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar
its a fair quality ultra cheap cable
this is a well made low noise and low cost cable
i have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time
another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site
i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks
all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in
as the description says this is a mild overdrive
i hate them as a rule
take 1015 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor
this little instrument tuner does everything
so the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens
ghs allows me to minimize that
ultimately my search was narrowed down to this spider and a fender mustang
i use to use a cloth to clean my strings
i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week
a steal in my opinion
outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget
it does jusy exactly whats expected
these guitar strings are very nice and i love them
that being said its still a very good pedal
thats a considerable investment to abandon
i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds
works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over
all in all its a handy little tool to have in the gig bag
nothing special but the price isnt out of the world either
because the slinkys are perfect
this is the least expensive holder i could find nov 2013
i have not encountered the dye running yet
fast forward a few years and ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals
for the same reason john lennon once owned a 34sized guitar i suppose
its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident
plenty of power as well
this tunners turned my normal cheap squier into a perfect squier
this pedal seems older as well
so far still made in america
battery life appears to be adequate
so stop thinking about it and just go buy it
this is a no brainer
bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc
it is an ok strap
there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport
it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it
i brought this for my husband drum set
the high midscoop mode is calling your name
happy that i did however
i was really surprised to see how well they sounded
i get a much higher output  much better response and much better sound
put the dough into the guitar not the strap
mic it and you can play it anywhere
good price for a good product
gave them a good stretch and theyre holding pitch well
cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster
ive had two of these tuners
these are not coming off anytime soon
the list goes on but i think you get the point
use them for home recording  nothing on the road
since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice
check youtube theres plenty on this great price pedal
ive even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype
my guitars are now out of their cases and up for display
the strings are very good
this new led version is built with less quality
there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time
and the tweeters sport silk domes
ever since then no buzz
it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg550xx
behringer gave me a link to download
is it a monster cable
this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so i returned it
i needed some little easy and portable guitar stands for the stage
the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity
really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile
thats when i went looking at the cry baby
okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic
consider it for your needs
this is my second sm48 in 25 years
im very happy with this stand
can get many different types of sounds and drive from it
and why would i shop any where else
i must say though that i had no idea it would be so huge
i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should
i would definitely recommend these
i am sorry i just cant dig it
a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily
i guess i got a bad one
overall reasonably satisfied will give them a good try later
it is more decorative than useful
lucky timing all black and fully assembled
if you have a standard size guitar neck dont bother with that
this is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing
sounds fantastic and is solidly built
no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords
sounds very authenic 60s too
this stand is small but does the job
i would recommend it to any friend and i already have
where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords
for less than 4 you can see if they work well for you
its amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha
i have several of these
it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric
purchased after another folding stand which cost the same  literally fell apart
its quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag
not much to say really other then they are good strings and work
the medium was the hardest out of the bunch
definitely holds the guitar well
here are a couple of more casual notes 1
some love them more than any other string and some are like me
i would definitely recommend this
has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo
the adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably
the capo is made of metal and works well
good feel grip and not too heavy or thick
above all this mustang is musical
its a wah and wah and does just that
if i buy more in the future i will be checking here first
my uke does not fit well in the stand
it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain
this was not thought out very well
i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing
i can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though
probably my second favorite after ernie ball
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam
people say its an ocd clone
if i buy another it would be a standard hanger
the joyo ultimate overdrive is simply a great pedal
i am thankful that i did not have any of said cracks or chips
the finish is pretty and i like the solid cedar top
it has what you want in a cable and not what you dont
the quality of the guitar is amazing
but i will never do that and neither will you
plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game
definitely a 5 star purchase
they seem more durable than other brands
i love my teles but i cant stand fender strings
i hated having to put the pick between strings
is ready to give guitars several times its street value fullon competition
ive used one of these before and dont remember it having lock washers
these sell for about 2025 in the real world
makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally
the amp is just about perfect for bedroom studio or practice
a string is in tune when the rings stop rotating
you dont need the hype
it feels more sturdy than the h2
theyll be easy enough to fixreplace when they fall off so no worries there
this little tuner is so easy to use and see
these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver
well not when itcomes to cables
not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob
for some of you its still a viable option
awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone
a note about the mixed reviews
works well with my stuff
leave it in your car to practice at lunch
still it works and was inexpensive
add in some delay and it will give you an organtype swell
this is a terrific product
no other distortion pedal can do it as well
this strap looks better in person than on the computer
unless you dont really use boxes
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say
having the built in gate is also nice and it works
the stand is very easy to set up
world has gone bass crazy since about 1981
the capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck
this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv
the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above
the 1 spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz
minus one star for a little price gouging
oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason
i dont think you could break this beast if you wanted to
this is a perfect strap for my guitar
it also just looks cool and very pro
i got this for our church
these are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables
i am very satisfied with my purchase
my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made
does what it should and yamaha quality
this package of picks is of good colors and good weight
i have used the kyser spelling
works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears
overall i can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at
when you place it on a surface top of your amp floor your knee
they dont do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do
sounds good and well worth the money
i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications
the 9led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern
vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers
i threw  out my gibson spray
i found that it just added more weight
and my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs
but this one is just fine
daddarios last a long time for me and they sound good
but im having fun and trying
the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow
ive never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is
for me that answer is a clear yes
does not have an onoff switch which is a bit disappointing
highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro
its a relatively short delay which is great for many genres
a toggle switch lets you choose between classic  modified setting
i have had two for years
i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness
i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable
mine came stock with a jj tubes 12ax7
above all it fits my epi lp perfectly
this is especially true for the g string
however i have a few gripes with the 2i2
i was impressed with the sound
go sell your snake oil to someone else
individual volumes controls make it perfect
i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point
also this tuner is tiny
everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion
but i had wire snips from my jewelry kit available
it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp
and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band
it proved to be very functional
these just did not perform as expected
these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name
sure its nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily
they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure
read the description so you can have a sense of size
a lot of fun and meaningful
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week
i keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times
these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break
bottom line  every guitarist should have one
its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these
it holds incredible its not coming out now for sure
had it for about two weeks and im about to return it now
i think i would stick with the black color though
theres a multiswitch for hall spring and room
itll serve its purpose until i can afford a real american strat
these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work
you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours
someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender
if i lost my pedal i would order another right away
however animals could have been harmed in the making
good upgrade for my squier deluxe strat
the 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects
the max grips have a much better grip
overall for this price you cant go wrong
works great for blues rock a little stoner country and even some metal
cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff
pretty cool knockoff of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo
the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked
they sound great and stay in tune
surely not but its the best cheap one
makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this
it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch
i got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas and she loves it
but if you demand metal get far away
the hde xlr to usb is ubs
these strings i put on my taylor ga4e
some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics
this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it
the  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by gls audio
you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal
9 million pounds and no casters
i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing
i would recommend this to anyone
they are well made and do work
great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic
go ahead and get this thing
it has a good seal also
these exp16s are superior to them all
using it as my gain along with the joyo vintage od for lead boosts
i would highly recommend it
i dont plan on keeping it long
fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap
i dont have any tone loss between these and
this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy
i tried the rest and returned to the best
these hooks are padded and rotate a little
there is a lot to think about with a strap lock
the price is dead cheap
you cant go wrong with the bright blue led either
the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too
if you dont have these already you better purchase them now
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
it is pretty comfortable to wear also
what else can i say
its made pretty well for a plastic tool
these are some of my favorites
all that said it is nice and some will love it
for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish
great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced
i really like the footswitch
this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319
yes its a pain in the butt
the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar
great strings an industry standard at a great price whats nor to love
so i popped in this kk
the sixinline enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping
at first i didnt like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock
its also very good looking
it proudly states the guitars origin of corona
used these for years on sons electric guitars
bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied
they are instead control picks
and ive tried almost every pick there is
they look play and sound great
is there anything else to say
they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store
works fine with any guitar
im just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool
so bottom line im not impressed
rugged pedal by a little known company
however there is a downside
it reacts quickly and is not oversensitive
great folks to deal with
i really like the deluxe bags by fender
this pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave
less gradation in setting than other tuners
i use is this mount to support a samson meteor mic
the rubber grip area is a joy to hold
it responds really well to my pick attack
this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar
i have not tried it with other stringed or nonstringed instruments
i recommend this cable without reservations
have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems
youll need a feedback buster and a good preamp
this being said its a nice tuner and stays on
so i sent them back
and on the mims fenders either cause both of mine are american standards
is this guraunteed for life or something
one other advantage these picks have is that they never break
this is perfect for that
dont trust the products anymore
doesnt get any easier than that
i bought this to work with my 9 year old son
one step on the cord and it came apart
you see i purchased an open box speaker
ill stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser
if this is the case spend the money to get a nicer filter
let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide
its not cheap and flimsy though
its soft and rubbery feeling and wont scratch your guitar
this is a good quality microphone
when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened
in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale
now i have more confidence with this strap
it works well and seems to be durable
i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home
also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays
cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far
id feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup
its a fantastic little tuner
none that i can really tell
the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges
tight tuning and easily used
on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy
works fine on some guitars
however the tone is different
once you get used to the small size there is no going back
these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite  and theyre cheap
i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass
no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing
vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular
if your fret board is pretty dry do not remove the oil
this is a good string
this pedal is 998 sounding like the mxr
will defiantly be buying more
21234 width worked well for me compared to the 434 version
the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus
a good variety of different picks
it could be that the string included is a cheap one
this strap is a great strap
10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower
smooth as silk work great  as all grovers do
they cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers
a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality
being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild
its well made and sturdy with a metal body
the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality
its also not the same size as the one in the photo much wider
the lighter the less tension you should use
t is  axlr to ubs cable
i really dont see how gibson can make and sell these for 99
not exactly what i wanted
i highly recommend this cable
as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though
the string tension keeps it balanced in the front
it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price
takes the edge off the violin sound
i swear by these quick release clips
there are different amp sounds you can get
its not great for gig use as the screen isnt that readable
havent had an issue with any in the 45 months weve had them up
i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes
i like them so much that i own five
honestly the best effect it held was the phaserjet pipe effect
minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar
after these strap break in though they are very soft and supple
however these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly
i bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice
sounds great easy to adjust
perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot
and i love the tweed cover
obtained free as part of amazons vine program2
what the hot tubes does is anything but 34familiar34 from an affordable od pedal
ive only used plugin types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise
one issue you may run into is the nut running loose
it does a fine job
for practice and the home studio it is great
really tight because its brand new but its really sturdy and solid
a very good pedal that you miss only when its off
doubt it works at all
taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers
the price was right so i got one
the display is better than most ive used dating back 30 years
great color and retro style as well
but they last a long time and sound great
for a long time i overlooked my sd1 and used other pedals
most of the popular options or 100 and up
does as described and really enhances your tone
there was no greaselubricant qualities
for the money i figured why not
cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it
they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great
upon arrival i was astonished
very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect
i love these patch cables
the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me
there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality
its also truebypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off
if it does break has a lifetime warranty
i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps
the sting cutter works well
received in just a few days
no popping or clicking at all
these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb dont sqeek
it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great
dunlop ultex picks sound much better
also the blue led is very bright
no way this thing cost lest than 40
this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well
very big saturated and warm
simply the best picks ever for bass
this product is something every guitar owner needs
this is a great buy for the money
this is an exemplary capo
i highly recommend this strap
the back rest support is nice too
wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this
there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use
it never needs to be removed
the price is right and the size is right
sold great quality xlr mic
the cover is supple and easy to coil
if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me
these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them
and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks
this tuner is tiny and accurate
now the bad  the sound
the cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well
unfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device
they turn out to be great
if youre looking to buy a capo id recommend this over a kyser
the fact that it is passive really kills it
mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are
its nuts being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic
been uning them for years
considerably less feedback 62 this was actually the primary reason i decided to upgrade
excellent product though the metronome is of no value but thats not important
this is a highly featurefull amp at this price point
these will save you time guaranteed
while youre at it buy ten sets
i bought one then i bought two more then i bought two more
it links well with other pedals
i wanted to like this
you will not be disapointed by it
does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive
i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings
if you dont try one
it does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price
great price for 12 picks spanning from light  heavy
not a bad product just dont know how long it will last
all my stringed instruments have been fitted with tusq parts
this is my first electric tuner
well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo
the resulting sound is absolutely topdrawer and completely belies the incredibly low price
some will disagree saying they break if theyre too thin
to be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different
the bright switch is an added bonus
perfect fit for medium picks
but as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better
it works but the levels are too low
then order this great little solution to a big problem
quality work was put into this thing
you will notice that some areas soak it more than others
this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while
arrived very fast inexcellent shape
nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern
it works in win 7 just fine
always spot on with the frequency
ive bought much more expensive cable that didnt have the quality of these
i really dont know what else to say about them
it has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone short or tall
darn i meant to test before this review
dont buy the high rated chrome capped ones i had problems with those
i am going with a wider one
these cables are very good
i dont think that you would go wrong
slides are meant to cover your entire finger all the way to the tip
can be folded for easy transport
this is a solid 4 depth and cozy padding around it for protection
youll be happier trust me
i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh
its well built enough to stand up to regular use
it does have an internal dip switch
if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more
disregarding those flaws its still obvious that its not a good case
i have several different slides glass brass steel short long etc
im a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s  vibe
perfect for old van halen solos like in 34you really got me
heavy construction in layered leather
he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain
thus far i am very pleased
im a beginner and i try to learn to play guitar
my expectations were frankly low
what can i say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
great mic for the price
save this as a preset
my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets
overall good strings good sound  this set simply didnt last very long
the dobro had the issue with the strap didnt have a great connector
i feel the display is an improvement  easy on the eyes
one has light strings  the other has medium
my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit
awesome little tool and very impressed with it
the mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance
just didnt have the tone and bite i was expecting
with the ipad this isnt as noticeable
you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right
arrived before projected delivery date
the spring is tough and it holds securely
these are my favorite picks to play with
but this seiko is certainly the quickest
this is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much
it is not going to come off because its that good
let me first start off with the sizing
i say go for it
form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed
they set the baseline for every guitar ive ever owned
hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully
and the price is right
this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped
this acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever
14 phone f  stereo 14 phone m
not what i thought i was getting  dumb me
these do a good job of isolating out the sound
they are very comfortable and easy to control
i love the very soft warm sound they provide
after four more hours the a string went
there is little to fault with it
be prepared to purchase these in tandem
daddario strings are like the kias of the string world
when i got my martin soprano which wasnt cheap it did the same thing
fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube
this fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection
you gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up
its nothing of the sort nor should it be
for one thing theyre pretty stiff
just one more affordable improvement for the home studio
like the first one works great
comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal
this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar
and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag
nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box
for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display
its a classic guitar it shouldnt have had steel strings to begin with
theres not much to say except that it get the job done very well
but after they stretch out a little they sound perfectly fine
as for the replaceable reed plates
running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong
3 for under 40 was fantastic
for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand
before you dive into the presets
there really is no midi support
geart for setups and takedowns
just buy one now save yourself the trouble
that being said the pedal sounds great
i got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool
all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it
this stuff works great and lasts forever
i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii
gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot
even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well
one of my favorites has become the planet waves clip on
this highjacks your audio defaults in windows
this was something i had to pick up simply due to the price
for metal artists i would recommend looking elsewhere
the string cutter works better than expected
very pleased with timely arrival of the package
the virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp
never used this seller or site for this purpose before
if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know
i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade
i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust
it works on my acoustic bass electric and my mothers voice
i like the dunlop design and price
ive never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few
the polish in the bottle works well and the lintfree cloth works well too
very strong in the set when worn
i bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price
instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design
the intonation issues are greatly reduced and i am thrilled
it is not so long as i thought
the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes
everything about the pedal is rugged and durable
if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you
the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones
i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings
the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose
i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts
out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive
durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack
the single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag
first lets get the easy stuff done with
secondly its fender reliable with a 5 year warranty
makes my life easier when i pack up and set up the equipment
its the same as the one amazon is selling here
the snark is the easiest and most stable to use
it worked very well on violin too
so no comments as to its toughness
i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good
this is an overpriced item
works fantastic and i am very happy with it
but on first play it pleasantly surprized me
if that turns out to be a problem i might reconsider my review
it can do a lot more but its what i wanted
not too big and gets the job done
there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rocksolid
none of that makes me dislike the pedal
only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar
they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock
i just used some 2 drywall screws
i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin
thats whats most important right
microphone is quite good for such price
it hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised i
i got one of those for my next mandolin after my johnson
that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia
i wouldnt put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed
very responsive very clean sounding
after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand
these are slick and seem harder to keep track of
i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up
just make sure to change them often to get the best performance
update december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider
one for bass rolloff and one for midrange emphasis  presence boost
i am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth
the tuning is deadon and couldnt be more convenient
makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body
still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender 34f34 logo
i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack
the most diverse pedal i own
it also has a different switch than the sm58
dont even think of using this for music
i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp
i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below
i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars
this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique standalone sound
ultimately you and your gear will have the last say
took a while to find what i needed but this is what i needed
the improvement in tone was immediate  this little guitar sounds pretty darn good
i gotta remember not to get the black ones though
price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on
i wanted to try these since the under 5 price is good
what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
theyre round and they fit over microphones
i have it in a 63 brown deluxe and am very good with it
i ended up switching to their padded strap
its not bad enough to deduct a star
i only use them and i have been playing for a decade
i ended up sending it back for a full refund
great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f335 perfectly
these strings are the bomb
i just really like this little guy
this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming
it is a string winder what more can i say
i also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents
this is a great little amp for practicing
i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix
when not in use it just gets put away
the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life
its an 8 channel xlr snake
its a well built solid case for the price
i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else
solid construction and the mounting just works
the software is a little lame and doesnt always work properly
just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more
but this device is simple portable easy to use and just plain works
but these work fine easy to get strap locks on
the most important part of video is the audio
im not a pro by any means
its not perfect but neither am i so 5 stars would recommend to anyone
i have this paired with the behringer c1 studio condenser microphone
and for its price outstanding
so i sent it back to amazon for a refund
besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years
but these do work really well
its the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument
ill never buy their strings again
i got the 50 standard black on black case
i have three mic stands with this one being the fourth
this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value
its not that hard though and the reward is worth it
i have been using on stage instrument and microphone stands for several years now
endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer
second is the mixer out
the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy
that may change along the way
this is one great piece of equipment
just got my stand today
type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome
new fail update  the tremolo in this unit just stinks
this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay
they sound amazing and feel fantastic
good construction and easy to put together
it has no trouble amplifying a turntables signal to line level
the 10mm tortex picks are blue
makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise
the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine
this board does the job for at least 6 pedals
i would recommend this to any beginner
we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating
i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box
i guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection
clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer
if youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect
save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar
i dont like the direction the dunlop faces it seems awkward
when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck
it seems to be manufactured well
you get what you pay for
recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun
this is a good buy
i wish its built with switch onoffrecomend to buyer
well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts
just picked up the korg pitchblack from guitar center yesterday
lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable
i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey
wish it was better made
no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping
banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice
i stand by that review
also the edirol r09 is the darling of the moment
cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me
word word word word word word word word word word
that would be the top of the deal
i am very impressed with this unit
but i enjoyed listening to it while playing
but other wise this thing gets a serious twostar 34meh34
im an irishstyle dadgad guitarist
the set screw fell out and could not be found
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
its a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass
downside seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings
at least i know that they fit snug
in a much much more obvious way3
and i am so glad i did
fits about 58 guitar picks or so
3 downloaded the 650 mb zipped installer
cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components
i just use them for different tones
does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units ive used
i easily reommend this item
a friend gave me a few of these and overall i like them
i am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands
i am not good at putting things together without help
the beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response
the spring could definitely be tighter
i traded in my line 6 and also purchased a roland micro cube
i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation
bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago
the board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles
dig in and it puts out distortion play soft and it cleans up
i had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing
this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great
the color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color
on top of it all its pretty affordable
i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it
it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden
i had this happen once
ok ive owned 2 of these danelectro amps
i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things
i wasnt all that happy with this strap connected to a les paul
dont even think about it
34 yes you might think so until you plug it in
i prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that
i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received
i purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter
well worth the small price paid
it seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around
has all the adapters i needed
i didnt believe it myself
makes nicks and scratches less noticeable
for me this one is just right
depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes
someone else seems to think its made by epiphone
angled end is a good fit
its one of the hest fuzz pedals ever
that may not be enough for some but works great with my studio mike
this makes it very convenient but also a bit touchy
still its an ok product
a lil awkward for some
the heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well
although im not onstage bouncing aroung
although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder
also i compared them to the sennheiser hd201
i used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier
i bought these when i had to retube my marshall jcm800 2203kk head
but you will not hear a difference
but why not round wounds
i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items
it is a fender product so it is well made
these are well made and dont strip when screwing in for the first time
have these on my tele very interesting to play around with
it is a real standout in value
when the z108 party patrol is out and about the never leave without it
its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside
within six months of its introduction jams and festivals became seas of intelli tuners
bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price
011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil
isnt that asking a bit much
these provided an easy inexpensive solution
the silver one is excellent and its made of aluminum not thermoplastic
500k pots and side body 14 trplug keeps the cable out of the way
when inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage
as with all dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional
a nobrainer for fender guitars
it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose
good structural integrity thus far
i like that one a little bit better
undaunted i ordered this musicians gear stand
i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets
the picture wont show it but they are about the size of a dime
lets just say this id never gig with this guy as my only tuner
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part
i read many negative reviews on several sites
fits either a tele or strat
for the price you cant beat it
he has enjoy and likes using the capo
it may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys
no there is still a little digital overlay around in there
you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides
i am happy with the purchase
but its not light weight
i bought 5 of them from amazon because they were such a good price
these straps are very good at a low cost
if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can
glad i have it only for the purpose i intended
the coating is much heavier than that of other strings
there is a handle and a shoulder strap
i dont detect any loss of tone
dirt box gold for under 50 bucks
it is not variable speed
this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitechs tl2
whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa
however it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar
it makes tuning a breeze
it might even be cheaper
if you are on a budget get one
fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar
i cheap buy and it works excellent
i love this little tuner
at 12 per shot who cares
they also make one with the 90 degree 14 inch input as well
solidly built works just as a mic stand should
having said that i dont like them as much as a regular nylon pick
love this amp and ive shopped every comparable model
it is basically a toy
if lost or stolen id buy another
very happy for this product
i have never had a hosa go bad on me
it gives me great sounds
admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then arent all mic evaluations subjective
but thats not a problem any more
these pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material
expect less for that price
i love the freedom the g30 gives me
i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box
the tone is clear and bright
easy to use accurate programmable lights up easy to read decent quality
and no im not hawking epiphone
if you use an ac adapter get a hum eliminator
im just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider
to say that they did less wouldve gotten the 1 star
if its still built like my case never can tell these days
planet waves does make good products
the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch
i love the selfratcheting feature of the g7th
other than that your can change amount of distortion
where the stand shines if micing amps
who couldnt use an extra arm or two when moving equipment
this thing has tons of gain
for that reason i just ordered another sn1
the best strings i ever bought and ive bought them all
all latch well and look good
it has a mastering section with effects
but the cutters are great
i finally got tired of messing with discs
and find a nice set of strings
i found instructions through a google search
it doesnt snap in place
i have used a different brand up until this purchase
it has done a pretty good job with many recordings especially in the field
it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned
wow does this stick or what
most real studio preamps are a good match for it
synthy  seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes
this is one of the top delay pedals the pros use
im sure ill be using the crybaby for the rest of my music life
the display is good and the tuners work well
this will allow me to show off and protect them
exps make my guitar sound like it should
looks pretty neat along with the george ls cables that are almost invisible
in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist
im glad i dont need to stuck with this anymore
price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo
the only 34fender34 ill ever be able to afford
i tried this at the store
there is no close second
nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch
it is very robust versatile good looking and not very expensive
the dunlop is well made as expected
im not going to recommend this over the 15 capos
large enough to fit the fender tuners
not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze
easy to use seems to be well made
im very happy with this pedal
i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise
i have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench
for the  its the best buy in my opinion
it does not break and is very sturdy
mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex
the bench is also larger than my others
it has about six knobs
i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it
like always dimarzio products are simply the best
i would also deeply recommendsnark sn2 all instrument clipon chromatic tuner
also certain notes sustain while others seem to die out too early
semiaudiophilea bit bass heavy but overall great headphones
if youre in need of a side boom look no further
the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones
the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound
lol the cord delivers good sound quality
guess that notch in the peg winder is it
theyve come out with the sn8 i hear which ill buy soon
i bought a 12 string one in blk
the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me
it works well for all of them and is inexpensive
plug it in via usb and you literally on your way
use this on my taylor acousticelectric which does not have a built in tuner
easy to use very low price classic sounds
and i got a kyser 6string capo in gold and that works well
mine seems to be fine doesnt look or feel flimsy at all
this is another in the mxr distortion line
felt just like the day it arrived from the factory
these last long without compromising the tone
you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned
im pleased with both stamps
i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the athm50
volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear
affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay
you cant beat the price
every one that ive used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly
if needed in the future i have these extra plugs
its easy to install and keeps things simple
the mic preamps sound pretty good  clean and relatively quiet
i ordered this primarily for my 5 string ovation bass
these perform well on single coils specifically telecasters
if it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating
they work and are cool looking
i dont feel i am missing anything compared to the medium
i bought this for my son so he could record with it
as i said this isnt a knock of these strings
i have amps that have this feature that due a better job
based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a nobrainer
i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades
all my guitars have these locks on them and im very satisfied
thank goodness pickup prices are coming down
from stereo to 51 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs
sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time
that is my only complaint
they have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound
it  weighs only 25 pounds 109kg so its portability is very good
otherwise dont have an adjustable tilt option
that said do it wrong and plunk
it a kyser quick change capo
let me start by saying that i never even opened these
i purchased the us600 specifically for the 34detune34 effect
it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights
this is heavy but strong
no issues in over a year
each band is hyper sensitive
finally i just went with this one and im pretty happy with it
these take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm
if you have a classical guitar get a classical capo
the clips look solid and so far they are solid
plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips
yes if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine
if youre hemming and hawing over getting one just do it
easy to use efficient sturdy looks nice and sounds great
re computers and drivers  almost all the tests went well
already has made my life easier
the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set
i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed
this one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorry
ill update this review when i get the new amp later this week
good luck if you buy it
the locking top is a good feature as well
nice bright and full sound
i ordered a new tank and now its great
subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with
i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric
glad i invested in it
i needed nylon core strings
nice size action and finish
make the sound clean and bright
this is a good solid cable with no problems
the design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy
from here you can get any type of compression you want or need
its small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus
the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke
the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing
i play guitar and ukulele
looks like 18x18 to me
these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well
this guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather
looks good on my yamaha acoustic guitar
installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes
i can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper
this little amp really impressed me
ive spent time and money way more than 1000 free advice
i have been using them for about 6 months
behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit
could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough
hopefully behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price
nice to have the whole set again
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer
i bought a 34like new34 product describing faded or damaged packaging
this is a very nice cable for the price
maybe its my naivete in hoping for a perfect instrument
i also appreciate the even tension across the strings
nothing but praise for this item
huge time saver and works as promised
knobs work well and the stand doesnt slip
until then thisll be a fun toy to play with
this pedal is no exception
for lt 75 shipped i certainly cant complain
ive also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands
i bought these to replace a pair of athm45s i had for 6 years
as of 0313 the plastic seems pretty thickdurable
i used in all my concerts and its excellent
good materialdecent paddingnice front pocketzippers function without issue
it does sound ok other than being a little bright
i can still use this but hardly
and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy
to my surprise i hear radio noises
love the colors and the price cant be beat
i ordered a pitch black for 70
im sorry but thats just idiocy in action
i bought this used off a friend when i got my first electric
i purchased these to replace the springs on my usa standard stratocaster
its a pleasantness that doesnt grate on your ears when you pluck a string
has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place
if there was a way to give 10 stars i would
i cant practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv
that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune
no problems with static crackling hum or other sound artifacts
it needs to be in front of a tube amp
easily installed on my parlor guitar
this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 14 instrument ins
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it
not much to say about patches
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves
i am happy with it
notice in the name guitar input
no buzz andor other noises noted
this is more of a user problem than manufacturing
any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability
after all if i ding this one up i havent broke the bank
my guitar thanks you as well grin
i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere
there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations
the price is right for these and they work just fine
nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well
likes  size assignable knobs
id give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial
the xls are comparable in gauge to ernie ball regular slinky yellow
this is another useful item from planet waves for the guitar player
having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards
this is a nice part
sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble
i use these at work now
this is a great capo
we tried it a number of ways and nothing worked
have not used the strings yet i bought them as back up
first and foremost  use single coils
much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made
then i happened across these elixir nanowebs
i would buy it again
i bought this one and it works great
the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use
also check out hosas sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter
the only problem is the size
now put that order in
a 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal wont power it
sometimes people dance right in front of us
i have used it on microphone electronics to shield out rf noise
this strap works fine for that
they can be switched back and forth even while youre sustaining a note
these things muffle sound great
has a tuner and a metronome
pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies
always a great sound at a great price
good sound quality for not being bone
the big question is 34why
i didnt notice much of a change tonally
i thought the boss pedal sounded pretty bad
it is a range of literally hundreds  perhaps even thousands of specific tones
again these should really come standard on all american strats
the build quality is great and i know that it will last
are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals
the handle gets real sticky and causes problems
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar
peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less
its just a practice amp
just dont get water on the wood
still its a very good tuner overall
but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing
size and fit were good
it fits snugly and is adequately padded
love the color coding too
this is a good guitar for the price
thanks it does what its meant to do
i am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases
plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands
i was displeased with a somewhat poorquality strap i was using before
i have an epiphone es339 and recently put these strings on it
but if youre popping and slapping these come through loud and clear
ive used three with no trouble
the tone knob does nothing
ive bought 4 of these over the past couple of years
all the pitch shift settings sound like theyre 30 cents sharp
thought it has to be so its out of the way
i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean
it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too
gb e were all flat on the fret side
best recommended for starters intermediate and pro player
it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend
nonmarring adhesive on back wont damage guitar finishes
this is a great effect
the purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2
this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals
just be aware that 050mm is really light for most players
2 things i forgot tuners wanna say 15 1
tone is good as is durability
going to upgrade electronics and everything else too
the switch is conveniently located on top of the light
great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff
stays in place and works as de
try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star
i definitely would say this is a musthave
if you need something more accurate i recommend investing in a good pedal
darrario does sell some fine strings
has a rich warm tone like tube mics
but roundwounds just didnt feel or sound right on a fretless
strings theyre all i use on my acoustic
these were purchased on a whim
other than that great picks
this is my third circuit breaker cable
they are expensive but worth it
i am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also
and im rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar
great price on a highquality polishing cloth
but maybe that saves on battery life
very nice classical guitar strap
for the price this is an excellent case
10232012  still holding up well
i think it really adds life to solid state amps
but thats yet to be seen
soothing music is part of the fix
love the all black look as well
i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles
acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one
what can i say it works
its high quality but i didnt consider it trying to pull my shirt off
does not fly off the head when playing
these picks are translucent purple
cigar box guitar 3 string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna 6 string
its nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play
most the reverb selection sound identical
you really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit
but what do i know
but it really does the job good tone
ill probably stick with extra light for awhile
this kyser will last a long long time
it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows7 computer
the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita
cranked out a nice distortion for my fender guitar
the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way
i tried the soft and medium wedgies but both were just too soft
the switches are rock solid
these look like rollers but are not rollers
easily adjustible knobs tighten easily and firmly
im not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short
it just arrived to day and seems wellbuild
im very pleased with it
purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home
these fender locking tuners are top quality
i have tried several rosins for my violin
maybe it just needs to be broken in
i have been playing for 9 years
slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable
super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables
cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel
bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones
i also didnt want a modeler impersonating a tube
tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard
however all you really need are the two functions and they work
the first is energyxt2 which i believe includes a license for the compact version
unlike the clamp kind like the snark its hard to share
when it arrived 3 days later it was a good one
a great investment unless you have a perfect ear
i dunno cause im stingy with stars
works well and has good sound
i highly recommend this product
but then again i didnt have to buy these
i really like the mediums
helped a lot with vibrations in my apartment building
bought 6 to replace to older models i had on stage
good lows and clean highs without any hiss
i was origianlly disappointed in the sound
the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy
it will help you tame this pedal into what you want
what is there to say
i really like this cable
as others have noted there are other better capos out there
i use it with a vht special 6
it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand
overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal
if youve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean
i used to use fender medium picks only
has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound
tuned them down to a sharp b flat
very sturdy stand suitable for stage use
no need to even use my pod pro
it seems to keep things humidified very well
use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though
and the price is very affordable
like i said for the price you cant beat it
the customer service is so easy and immediate its worth the piece of mind
after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better
i have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars
the string winder is a little awkward
strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player
got this to put into my pseudocaster project guitar
these are thick strings but still bendable just not very far
the back side will shed for a while before settling down
its been holding up well
tune in and check it out i think you will agree
what the more expensive model has going for it is looks
great tuner just bought 8 of them for xmas presents
this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music
its well made and works well
what more could you ask of strat knobs
very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick
its yellow its metal its boss
the capos well made and doesnt show any manufacturing flaws at all
i had a hard time lineing them up to install
i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings
come on capos dont have 34tone
the bottom line for me is  it does and it doesnt
i didnt change battery for more than 6 months
amazing strings they last longer feel better on the bends than any other
just buy it you wont regret it
neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop
this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage
this is my 3rd set of cables i ordered from amazon
i think i have 3 or 4 of these
they sound great to me personal opinion of course and are priced right
it has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility
well made and look and feel sturdy
nice strap but a bit too stiff
this is what im talking about  cheap but very usual form behringer
well at least for me
reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record
they have a brassy sound to them
if the amp couldnt do it naturally when it comes to dirty tone
it was like there was no pick
this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use
it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks
good idea but way too lightrickety to be useful
youll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions
best 90 i have ever spend
i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future
this gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique
a near miss with the ns
ive always used ernie ball strings
i fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability
live and in the studio these strings work for everything
what more can i say its a sheet stand
it looks very neat and tidy
im very happy with this pg58
if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp
everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem
for many years ive been playing with proel and 34fender34 cables
it does work well and will power many pedals at one time
13 strings and well is simply too much
i bought one for every bass and a spare
really helpful both in live gigs and at home
would i prefer something nicer if  werent an issue
but these ones really get the guitars shining up really nice
1 star off for not looking like the higest quality
or to the desk where i sit and play
this one for my new ovation 12 string cc245 is what i needed
its just a perfect standard wah
they loop two strings together and i hate that
this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver
easily the best quality capo for its price
i dont have any complaints
they seem bright yet still soft
it works perfectly with my sound card
it mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need
the portability factor is huge in my opinion
you just have to try them and see
its just more accessible on the desk
the cutter makes this thing really worth while
it not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality
it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up
this issue is why four starts rather than five
i use mine on a martin hd28 and have had no problems whatsoever
i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner
but since my room isnt perfect this will do
i use them with my pedal board and havent any issues with signal quality
very very easy to install and protects
my 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks
epiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar ebonyhello again
i have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus
i have always used tortex picks
you just cannot be without one
ive been playing guitar for 40 years
its probably not the product thats described here
the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool
this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugerabehringer product
best strap available for the price
mine arrived in perfect condition
i think their pretty accurate
it does almost everything i need
the elixir website its pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding
but thats where the similarities end
great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it
maybe i just got a bad one
minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some bright strong mids
ive been very disappointed with this tuner
not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing
fx loop only works with an effect bank
i am pleased with this product
my amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style
best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody
paradoxical i know but thats where the magic of this strap is
the display is very stable and its simply fun and easy to use
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand
the leather itself isnt a bad quality but its not the finest
i also tried high and low but set it back to middle
i cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general
i did the same with these 3 sets
check out the pictures ive posted
i imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing
it is consistent easy to use and compact
most work by using a small builtin microphone that picks up sound waves
can be upgraded in time if you choose
so many over the years i cant recall
although i play guitar i find the other side of the wheel less helpful
these tuners look and feel great
bottom line  inexpensive wellmade accurate timesaving
this is a simple elegant strap that inspires envy
i really did not expect much from this rag
two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want
i got this for christmas and would shop around a lot more
it is a  great product
if im committed to learning ill get a better one later
not for me maybe for you
they look great theyre easy to install and they work very well
it has had no issues at all
kudos to tascam for making such good headphones
after watching a side by side comparison on youtube i decided to buy one
this is a greatsounding reverb pedal
they are the only ones i trust
it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit
i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim
it plugged into my behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely
i like this a lot better than others that i have
but it wont hurt your back
i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it
they are clean cut smooth finish
schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place
the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension
very flexible but solid feel to it
really nice piece of equipment for a small price
coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles
if you never used it get a can you wont regret it
this thing sounds completely transparent when its off and completely natural when its on
it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it
the h4n is a work horse
e removes the pops from vocal recordings
i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere
i am using it with a seagull entourage mini jumbo
it does what its designed to do
this takes care of that problem for a couple of bags
the tone is a touch wooden it doesnt sing as the old taka did
i am very impressed with how nice this strap is
they arrived on time and i will order them again
great sound works just like a phaser should
the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath
when you record singing you need this to prevent the pop sound
warm distortion and good controls
if not your money is best spent elsewhere
right now though id say great product
as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say
its only got a basic feature set but thats all i need
perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and depiezo the tone
what can i say i am a string snob
it is 100 accurate and very easy to use
comes with nice screw on 18 to 14 adaptor
first time ive spent over 25 bucks for headphones
i just learned last night how to coil them up
naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling
the bass is tight and articulate which is what you want
it is a very good value though
the fulltone full drive 2 is another incarnation of the original fulldrive
if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava
we bought this rack tray for our sons new sound rack
despite this the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good
they arent that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter
works for my behringer xm1800s mics
first of all this strap looks super cool
its great for a desk or a small recording studio
i didnt use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs
they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required
i am so in love with my 34pinkie34
for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine
yes they are made in china now
extremely versatile and as is typical with all boss pedals absolutely sturdy
i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is
these microphones are great for recording vocals
although this plays well i was disappointed with the workmanship
these picks were no different from picks without the 34gator grip34 imho
i found this pick very responsive flying through the scales on my les paul
the gold finish matches my instruments hardware and they are sturdy and durable
made in usa a very good price
i cant imagine working without them
it is well crafted and cheap
i arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly
i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes
also i like having the two polar patterns switchable from cardioid to omni
it sounds amazing for the price
bottom line for gigging probably go with the 100s
phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass
works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster
solid construction and great sound reproduced
the nanoweb coating is nice
why do i go through all that you ask
robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble 75
may buy one for my dad next
i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p90 pickups
use 5 of them in my case and they work well
they are absolutely fantastic for the price
if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal
thick non scratch foam is a plus
from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed
im very satisfied with the performance of the cm2
it does however sound amazing
i ended up using a daddario string of the same gauge in its place
i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments
if you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one
all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price
it is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly
i did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good
i dont hate any of them
i absolutely love them for my fenders
initially installed jj el84s after reading so many good reviews about them
nice strap for the price
i actually bought three of them
this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding
i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube
i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing
i have found the stand to be very stable
it looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands
there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range
it has a 18 mini earphone jack for private use
this pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me
60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups
i have a 75watt amp that powers a 12 celestion speaker
they work well on my electric and my acoustic
i write and record my own music
the celluloid one fell apart quickly so i wanted a better material
there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases
really simple little review here
i needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic
i have two of these now and they may be my favorite
the sd1 is widely owned and very affordable usually around 50
i am using three guitars on stage when possibleroom permitting
this is my second after breaking the last ones neck
i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux2
i have absolutely no gripes with elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings
that being said its a great little stand for low dutyhome use
for that 5 stars easy
theres a nicelycompartmentalized carrying case
bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter
ill be sticking with these for the long run
once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product
the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not
this strap is very long if you need it to be
amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too
but my effects boxes like to have separate 14 tr ins and outs
the brightest tone normal lifespan fair prices and louder than the rest
youll like this stuff better than anything youve used to date
i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best
there are other excellent strings available
the chorus effect has plenty of adjustment tone and depth
the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box
made in the usa was a great thing to see
this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage
plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo
the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand
has anyone else noticed the me70 reviews out there arent too useful
i will be working on this
also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily
this one is more confortable and has great grip
i played it finger style and strummed with a pick
im not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra
fits nicely into my acoustic guitars
i reattached the item and added a windscreen
but dont let that deter you
overall good cloth for general use
constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough
the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic
theres a highpass filtertremendously useful when rumble is a problem
i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex
you cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal
may be  the age thing
this stand is very sturdy well made  durable
the distortion was much more fizzy
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier
it doesnt seem to work
highly recommend the apogee jam
not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge
the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived
the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance
the cradle guitar stand was for a friend
cord is long enough 6con build quality is slightly less than the fc4
this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use
it is very heavy duty great chrome plating
at the time i figured all picks were created equal
people that say it is loud arent kidding but there are limits
its not that it does not have it just could use more
it has a headphone jack also
ive been hooked on daddarios for quite a while
but they may work fine on lightly braced guitars
to my ears the rest were less distinctive
to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings
everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it
change them its a very quick fix
and folds up in to a small package
but for now im impressed
this is a great effect
i plan on buying him another set of them for christmas
i can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones
however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build
they are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them
the clarity is superb and the bass is awesome
and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce
this probably doesnt matter to all of yall though
they are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders
i tried them back to back
if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chart
i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that ive had for years and years
so it is an amazing critic for us beginners
i dislike it so much i had to edit my review
idk what mics use that but is something to note
ive never used the metronome feature other than to check it out
if you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board
u wont be happy either
he uses elixir for both and swears by them
and i have to really hammer on them to trigger
not much i can add to the review that isnt well covered already
i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it
after my custom telecaster fell
exactly as described in the ad
i bought these black locks to go on a black stratocaster i built
this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters
this is good quality for the price
you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible
i still cant believe how light it feels
yes i would recommend them to other uke players
in comes the planet waves
i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock
sure enough the lining is soft and wellpadded
the fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection
i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster
i own a piece of the legend and music history
it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat
perfect to try different sizes and shapes
if youre looking for an economical strap this will work great
but it works well and the batteries seem to last
im really happy with my new picks
i got two of them
one of the the best lights i own
someone will appreciate it but not me
i like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std
it really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar
get a few just in case but i am still on my first
great quality an very robust
thank you ernie ball for making far superior strings
as for this joyo i cant complain
i couldnt be happier with this pedal
i own the sn8 which btw is the best tuner ive ever used
but for seven bucks it gets the job done
but it doesnt just read the letter of the note your on
joyo jf03 crunch distortion   this little guy surprised me
other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap
silent tuning so on stage its almost a must
ive been using this for a month or so and it works as described
it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured
on a personal level id prefer it didnt say epiphone on the outside
i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice thats about half price
this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand
they bend quite a bit and are very easy to use
im an amateur musician so im on and off on playing
it works on my orlando classical guitar as well
a nice pedal to have to be sure
sounds all right to me bright and well balanced sound
i only wish digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper
now i cannot live without it
the sound guy thought it was an sm 58
i hope hes right cause i love this little tuner
pros  great price very loud as well as clear
what makes these a bargain is construction
a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire
in fact i am pretty impressed
anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical
i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition
best price and overall value compared to the name brands
you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick
anyway this capo works well
under 10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from 2050
the apogee jam cured all of that instantly
i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker
save your money this pedal is good enough
i am using this for my 112 amps
i popped my e string overtightening it when i was setting it up
i just used this for a gig on monday
while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking
first off id like to address any construction concerns
it actually delivers much more sound than i expected
first the pt2 and now the pro
this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole
other than that its perfect
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs
i like these 942 pure nickel strings
im used to a higher quality from eb products
however recording a choir or something would work
they had mimimal oilstain from the factory
from very thin and flexible to 08 and hard you get a selection
its a pop filter it works well and does the job
a cheap guitar doesnt always mean a pos
dont think ill fool anyone but what the heck
im just glad that i got one of these from amazon
this cover does not fit a full size acousticelectric hohner guitar
i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration
and its more than the switches difference which i dont use anyway
you might end up with 6 like meor morein no time
the mike doesnt have an onoff switch perhaps its  only real deficiency
well padded lots of good pockets does all that it should
ive had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone
i will buy more if i get another guitar
i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals
not sure which they have
its never worked properly since
the feel a little more stiff my usual
of course a guitar cable is a required extra
highly recommended by all serious ukulele players
i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from
included with the amp is an owners manual with simple startup instructions
ive been using this product for a while now
we bought the pylepro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma230
the sn1 settles quickly and works with a wide array of instruments
they have good signal though and dont seem to alter the tone
again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands
this one is a keeper
its flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable
it has a nice metal case for storagetravel
this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style
and these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply
also got the tuning pegs
how complicated can that really be
its got knobs and buttons
constructionwise these are likely lifetime cables
and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg4 guitar stand
it is still in great condition
i dont play my martin very oftentoo busy with electrics
also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides
its almost like picking with with just your fingers except with more volume
my only small 34concern34 is the length of the arm itself
it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes
it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt
it hasnt failed him yet
the gel in the name sounded intriguing
i was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this
i am looking to change if i can find something else
this particular one is just ok
hasnt had any problems with it
been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else
at 20 this bag looks like a great value
so if you do get a bum string give them a holler
i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand
i would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point
however there is 1 con to this wonderful instrument
is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier
and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in
theyre wonderful folks and they do excellentlyaffordable work
not for real heavy usage anyway
very pleasantly surprised buy this one
this is the 2nd tuner like this that i have purchased
at first i was not sure what i was looking for
the stand is very stable and works well
and why do these cost so much more anyhow
this was a huge disappointment
it works great and looks better
this cable is complete garbage
kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping
this guitar sounds good feels good looks very good
i dont use it for any heavy use
the differences here between the sn8 and sn1 are quite noticeable
for the price and product quality you cant go wrong with this one
mine didnt come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though
wow best ever in this category
i use this with my audio technica condensor
if you are disappointed and want something better expect to pay at least double
absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret
i needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs
you dont have to plug into it
eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned
the audio adapter is well built
this is not a bad way to get started playing with that
the sound is richer and clarity makes unique
the leather is tough and will last for years
they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price
with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get
i dont forsee having any problems with it
the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing
really wanted to like this one because i loved the price
the box for tuner was a little smushed
fender original parts cant be beat
at home or on the go i cant see the need for another tuner
sometimes this new one just wont 34hear34 the string being tuned unless its encouraged
i also like the tone a lot
i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably
about the same tension as 9s on a strat
knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love
i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most
there is a tone circuit bypass switch that i do not fully understand
but for everyone else including fortunate children the current mini is a sweet ride
i was going to buy the boss rv5 when i somehow discovered biyang
you can easily set your intonation with this little monster
buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits
ill probably be returning this unit asap
its holding a gibson les paul so it has to be trustworthy
because i wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors
i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day
i was surprised at the good quality for such a little price
other than that works great i like using it
i use this often to record my bands gigs
put a battery in and plugged it in
nice thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky
this has got to be heard to be believed
overall great buy for a cheap little money saver
the capo also has a handy builtin pick holder
ive only been using the yellow one so far only just started using them
these feel a bit weak
i bought 2 of these hangers and theyre rocksolid
i can say its built much better than i thought it would be
they do seem to stay in tune well
i have several brands some more expensive but i always come back to gls
great variety of uses for it
i like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well
for me and my son it works great
i use a little finger grease spray and i would recommend them to anyone
because when its switched on without the battery theres no sound coming from it
or so maybe more if you keep them lower down
i bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out
if fender solved that it would be perfect
as a dedicated nylonstring player im always looking for the holy grail of amps
the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator
and at a great price to boot
it works and i like
id recommend these to someone trying to save some money
and i even predrill it
also used these for the tremolo back cover
if you are thinking about buying this product do it
i havent seen that in any amp in this price range
the package game a little smushed so its a little misshapen
treat these like halogen bulbs
some are very dull looking
this strobe tuner is cable input only
my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs
for example im playing with the harmonica now
it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it
i changing my review from just okay to contextually perfect
not great but not bad as well
hard to beat the price
my daughters use all of them every week
these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand
it will polish and lube things like floyd roses
so are these any good
i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar
i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers
very pleased with this item
this is a quality stand
common complaint i have seen   no clean channelpreset
this is an awesome pedal
this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives
as with all boss products ive been very happy
i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music
ive seen reviews about this brand being noisy
i believe these are nicer than the epis
looks good and has the fender logo prominent
i bought this using prime and am happy with the power supply
it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical
this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there
i only installed into studs and wouldnt really want to try a drywallonly installation
adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive
and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section
i wouldnt buy anything but elixirs for years
you have a level control a gain control and a tone control
best tuneri have owned for the price
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
this guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was
so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes
but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin
this is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players
fits mxl cube mics perfectly
they look great up on the wall
this proved to be a good decision
i love how hefty they are
this one is definitely the best
this makes it easy to copy to my pc and keep organized
didnt know until i sampled quiet a few
this can be used to  semi  record music too
what can i sayi love this thing
apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad i did
i cant handle 12 strings and the sound of 10 is terrible
this is the best capo ive ever owned
i got it for my son to toy around with
as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings
im using this in v1 in a 5 watt tube amp
compared to ernie balls cloth its good enough for wiping down things
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the onoff switch
this leaves the level controlsa place where mxl could have been more careful
at a bar youll probably need to mic it or use the included lineout
the sound is very good
sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound
i recommend it to home studios also those who travel with recording gear
the tm300 is more than just a distortion box
almost hard to read tiny
bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot
so why the new strap
support cords seem to be of good quality
yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right
i usually use martin sps but i decided to give these a try
got them in 3 days
if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must
however its not for all acoustic guitars
stopped working all by itself
erm it does what it say it would do
for the money you cannot even make your own
it was 4 dayspast the delivery date
but overall the amp looks very well constructed
im using it karaoke online in paltalk
this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball
delivered promptly and in excellent shape
i will always buy snark tuners
this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and id buy another
it is a small design amplifier and does its job very well
i will never be without one again
those units have their own tone problems but thats another review
so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar
it turned my partscaster into a blues making machine
this seemed perfect and it is
immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings
they are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable
at first i wasnt sure what to expect from these daddario balanced tension strings
as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home
i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly
thejasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar natural
i bought this for my 1974 martin d18 for recording on my pc
or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it
it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings
this is a very serviceable strap at a great price
comes with a db limiter 16dbswitch right on the mic
plug it in and its ready to go
i feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better
i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb
handy well made small easy to see
myself i have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall
the led is really bright
first the goods  sturdy leather construction just cant be beat
i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band
this product lives up to its calling
and then there is the the metalonmetal clankyness
for the money you cant beat it
this analog chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
i have used these without any problems whatsoever
that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks
i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay
reduces string noise as promised
it makes my recording convenient
it looks high quality and has the white ends
im looking forward to using the scarlett more to improve my guitar playing
at 25 i figured i could chance it
loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone
i give it just 4 stars though due to its design
i wish it had a power switch
but no hum or noise and seems solid
this is such a lifesaver or an effort saver
at the time i bought was 16
i dont believe i would buy again until a sealed container is provided
it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug
the leather feels a bit cheap as well
its meant to be left on an instrument
the tool is made of sturdy plastic
with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else
bwoosh loop  no tingting
it works perfectly and my recording are rich and full
it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments
subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound
buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string b3
its easy to rename the files you just open wdmausbinf
cant reccomend it enough especially considering the price
but thats not enough now a days
they had a rough feel and were stiff
nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style
so sexy with my sg
i found a stud  it works  looks fine
i definitely feel relieved to have them off
as long as you get one that works
update 3112 so far so good
wish they had put that in some instructions
i have finally discovered that the 34perfect set34 is a moving target
one u never have to worry about breaking them
it is also a great value for what it does
this is a close second to the g7th
this is better i think
this is a good item and has served me well
works great and you cant beat the price
all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders
i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz
perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic
operation is simple press once to record
i really wanted sure sm588217s but the budget did not allow it
does what it is built to do
ive been using mxr micro chorus for over 30 years
so i had no bass control
i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply
it tends to fall off quickly on low notes
i needed a stand at home and this does just fine
with large fingers like mine it almost disappears
delivery packaging etc were very good
effects loop is on the front
it gets softer with time and use
i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage
feels comfortable to wear also
the only way to find out for sure is to experiment
the bag is simple canvas
the pm05 has more boom but less treble
only complaint is the size which is my fault
i just hope it works in the field as well
for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb
i record with fl studio and its even great so far
you dont need to spend big money for tubes
im very pleased with it
what else is there to say
this is my 3rd vox amplug i have purchased through amazon
they will last for a long time and they are a good product
it has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks
overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone
i bought a glaesel bridge  this glaesel rubber mute together
makes the bass sound pretty bad
it works and is my second favorite
this cup bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water
overall my favorite snark model and my favorite clipon tuner
it is heavy and small what gave us attack
minor clean up in post
i still tried it with a difference mic
not really that good for  music
most have been in the 30 range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko
solid and super easy to use
you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow
the treble strings bend pretty easily
okay so here is how i put it to the test
these are manufactured on the cheap
not too much to say about a cable
it seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks
ive had several sets for 13 years and use them without hesitation
the screws strip out too easily
i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner
it works great so far
this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand
the pickups are surprisingly good
this is not a pick for windmilling guitarists
i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic
i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out
these cables are sturdy and sound clean
the basic stuff on the bullet is very good
it has a terrific sound and its gorgeous
when used with a pedalboard rig it doesnt add much except for hiss unfortunately
i brought my baggs para acoustic di and i was glad i did
also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock
it does what it should
very well made and durable
dropped one a few times and its still working
its so similar i contacted daddario to ask them what the difference was
first behringer pedal i have returned
it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar
at least theres no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion
better than the nady starpower mic i also bought from amazon
the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static
which in the end is my concern
ive heard that these can be fragile but im pretty gentle with my gear
i have an electroharmonix pedal thats bigger than this amp
it is unusable until repaired
i bought this product to use on my amp pots
what will they think of next
like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you
i am average build and play a strat
so is that like 20 hail marys for that confession
id definitely recommend them to anyone who doesnt like tying on their guitar straps
not that i ever use it
buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone
there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time
wouldnt even think twice about it
i hope it never breaks
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
it is not a horrible mic
however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions
simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively
i bought these for the soprano ukulele i bought for my little great niece
the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws
i have them in purple which makes them stick out
i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic
the sound is a lot more there
i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose
they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex
also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun
between the 1st and 5th fret i dont really need adjust
well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water
probably a centimeter or so wider
i liked how solid it was
the ability to modify with fuse is an additional layer of gravy
it is heavy duty but also light
unless trying to use the jam
a monkey could have written a better driver
its been the vintage tube monster every time
i couldnt be happier with it
exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope
likewise it worked well with my 4string bass as well
it has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well
the tuners i have for my guitarbanjo have modes for use as a metronome
he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings
in order to be used effectively the tuning space must be relatively quiet
with phantom mic its well done
get off the fence and buy this pedal
preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones
the variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects
easy to do and youll notice an immediate increase in distortion
both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp
but after 1 song you have to tune it again
that being said that person probably isnt playing much guitar
the taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should
i really like the soft flexible cable these have
my item arrived lightning fast
i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure
very good for a quick tune up
a little background first i guess
one of them was particularly great
it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need
i have room for one maybe two more
never using another tuner again in my life
the yamaha keyboards that take batteries dont come with an ac power adapter
makes it easy to clean too
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer
works like its supposed to
i received this yesterday in my order
i see they make a mahogany version i think du200
my kid is happy with this strap for his guitar
for the price this is a great deal
it is portable folds up easily for storage
mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine
this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up
the extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability
and for every job there is the right tool
further it will not add something else to findloose in my pants pocket
it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps
my neighbors im sure are not pleased
i hardly notice im actually wearing it
i would purchase these again for my needs
i may end up gluing it in place
channel switching is a breeze with almost no delay
i bought this amp for my 7 year old son
it stays where you set it and works wonderfully
now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic
i highly recommend this amp
it has no depth to it
not perfect but a solid stand
even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well
i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami
bar chords were terrific too
look it up on youtube
i got this for my boss loop station but it doesnt work very well
i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly
i wish i had went in a different direction
you can use this with any usb audio interface
saw these and tried again
i can crank em all if i want to and go nuts
when using with a computer but they dont
this arm is a direct replacement for the original
so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue
i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night
the amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior
guitars at that price may be twice the cost
i continually look at it and cant believe i only paid 30 for it
this is a solid little usb interface
these picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms
also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range
we tried to make the fendershallers work but just could not
good   plenty of gain on hand
if you want a good all around microphone this is not it
its onoff switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which i never use
stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials
guitar string 95 between 9 and 10
i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it
compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss
could i pull off amazing licks that i couldnt do with my normal picks
these pots are cts and have a nice tight feel compared to alpha pots
this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics
the 57 version is also like its shure counterpart
i ordered this for my husband the musician
i use this for my home recording studio
cool speaker and nice addition
stick to nickel and you will be glad you did
do not use these or any other foam for that matter on nitro finishes
this cradles my guitar nicely
that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit
this immediately lets them know to just speak into the microphone
the generic ones installed were from 2010
theres nothing adjustable about the backrest
i have multiple guitars for different styles
snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great
ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly
but lets be clear what a tube overdrive pedal is and isnt
right out of the box playable
overall i am quite pleased with these
may be for the big one
well everything is being returned except this pedal
otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
i love the colors and the matte finish too
the g7th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose
at this price hard to complain too much
it sounds great and i like the headphone and mp3 player hookups
i have several clipon tuners that clip directly to the headstock
its not a metal type distortion but it nicely covers everything else
but this means trial and error and a busy wallet
its affordable and it works
this gig bag was just what i needed to carry around a soprano ukelele
straplocks are a must for any electric guitar and these exceed that need
shines nice and doesnt leave it feeling oilysticky
you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea
i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars
the jig method is super easy and provided great results
dont let the offbrand name put you off
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk
i have 4 of them
however for other people the sm58 works better
for the price these pedals are outstanding
i like this one the best
this is my first fatsoflex cable
teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks
the mxl fit like a glove perfect
this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar ok
the quality is really nice
it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price
companies that dont test their products dont deserve your business
good trees for the price
these strings did that just fine
some have two pedal effects some have 6
i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing
s display to be more than sufficient
i can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder
it will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs
i didnt have one at all and this workgs great
this case will fit the 335 dot casino sheraton and the gibson es335
i thought they were all great
the backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this
that proved to be true to form
i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all
this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar
i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars
no brainer built to last and the carrying case its outstanding
being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning eadgbe
i can honestly tell a difference
it sounds ok for the price
bak and  then save them as wdmausb
nice volume coming out of it also for 75 watts it seems more
its cheaper and works very well
it was just a light reverb i get
its not loaded with gimmicksjust the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed
for a committed neophyte like me the ufo202 was probably sufficient
i hope its analog but theres nothing about it in the documentation
but its not the reason why i drop by one star
no worries though now im learning my new favorite instrument
first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x3live
i have purchased six so far
its a fact of life
it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it
there is no hum when the unit is on
not perfect but not expensive
these daddarios do both things and do them well
ive used this for about 3 months now
and nice its like really just wow
this string compares significantly to the proarte string
it makes working with a condenser mic easier
ive only used the string winder so far but it works well so far
that is why i chose black for mysecond set
you can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries
if you really need some get some more substantial pads
if it doesnt sound good then i try something else
lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible
i have at least 5 of these
the height is easily adjustable and the shelf tilt is easy too
they are very smooth and warm and magical like a mythical unicorn
but this is true for most strap lock systems
drop in replacement for both my mim and mia strat
theres not enough throughput in usb 11
some guitarists will love these
it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping
the pack brings 6 picks
like the other reviewers on here im sad to report that its quite hissy
nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesnt work
it clips on easily and firmly
too large or stiff and you will not get the sound
it works for what i use it for
im using it totally stock and its been great
its easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks
looks like it is holding up so far
this drop clutch is just fantastic
but an arm on it and that could be a different story
really awesome item for any type of electric guitar
my budget must be tripled at least
for the price it cant be beat
they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill
the big name delay i replaced  in all honesty  wasnt as good
no rocking sideways no wobbly action
for the price it does a very good job
finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot
of course guitar strings can be a personal preference
with high output humbuckers you still get some mild tubelike overdrive at zero gain
not much you can say
i bought a set awhile back for my ovation but never used them
if youre always dropping picks losing picks breaking picks this is perfect to have
its a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff  love these patch cables
great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics
ive owned just about every muff
its so much better than the elastic capos
ive installed them on every fender i own
i use this microphone mainly to record music
its just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind
they sound more mellow and not as bold
however my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely
the sound is kind of acoustic guitarukulele banjo ish
you will be far far happier
i like these little guys
i doubt that the 200 stuff is much better
has 6 stringsfrom e to e
i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding
i honestly dont see the purpose
qualitywise it feels a bit cheapish
this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band
so in a way this is the most important pedal you can have
is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue
but if your gonna use it live
a welldesigned strap that looks and works really nice
i would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both
the pioneer hdj 2000 has the look
not expensive was less than
they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus
either way it works well
they are easy on my fingers and give great tone
it even comes with a case with two zippered sections
as for the sound of the pedal its very good
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
i bet more than a few of these quietly show up in nashville studios
two fender american standards gibson es335
i am very happy with this product so far
grade a cable at a very affordable price
and this with that extra filter on it it blocks even more
tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly
well made product strong and looks good
again my bloody experience taught me that
monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price
so far iv used it on my 67 electrics and my taylor acoustic
i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations
i have no clue im an amateur
with the wall wart no di hum  great
john mayer and other of my favorite musicians use these strings there great
i m obviously not a 34techie34
so my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing
seagull to me is overhyped
the acoustic guitar quick release system is very interesting
this item is very convienent
different in a wow way
not the greatest cord i have ever used not the worst either
compared to elixirs these are a bit brighter with good feel
in my sample of 2 it made highend guitars sound worse
however the rocktron zombie doesnt sound good through solid state amps
a best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians
i had a similar amp before that died
needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget
the pick had a little more give so i dropped them less
also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use
it doesnt get much action my amp has a reverb
affordable accurate and they dont fall off your knee all the time lol
it is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise
cut them to size and stuff them in
was a clear mike but i didnt detect any body to the sound
its just a great option to have for casualbudget guitarists
the sound was much nicer to my ears as well
this is a hard shell tolex covered case
just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot
just feels right for the job
i use the green 88mm picks and also the orange 60mm ones
i love the pick attack with these
i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it
sat800 has a auto and manual mode ca40 has auto
there isnt much about it that would give away its price
always great products and always dependable
everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage
their strings produce excellent sound and are durable
it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time
this was one of two i purchased
its well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market
the best od i have ever owned
its perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up
it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads
rotomatics will go on every guitar build i do
this is good for now
beyond the halfway setting it wouldve hurt my ears
these arent the dirtcheap  these actually have some nicer connectors  midgrade level
im not a guitar player so this uke is just a toyexperiment for me
thats the price you pay for a flexible pick i guess
this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it
like all boss pedals its as sturdy as a little truck
includes a nice hard plastic carrycase too
other than that ive had no problems
was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised
thats because by themselves the athm50 dont have a flat frequency response
the planet waves oports gives me that extra
i use it to cradle my electric guitar it works beautifully
i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar
its a great tuner a little pricy but worth it in the long run
this one is also super accurate and allows you to really finetune your instrument
i love adding channels to amps and that is exactly what this pedal does
the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig
ive tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer
since then ive been through a multitude of guitars and strings
it works as it should and does well
buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldnt have any worries
im a bit indifferent to this mod
they cost a little more than other strings but theyre worth it
its light and has great sound for interviews
great for beginners and intermediate players
the switch is easy to use
i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs
very nice quality of leather
i am very pleased with this 1634 crash
which i purchase through amazon
being see through distracts me
i have a dot studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly
yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster
theres some good bass classical music was clear
i just got this and love it
very nice product and fits well and good quality
the 3 foot is perfect and it works great
its made in germany so it could be taken into battle
it said it was brand new
not to mention boutique quality at a working mans price
so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts
they really are like a new set of strings
10 but the led doesn8217t lie and it confirmed
i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands
even thoigh they work on many brands
each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting
and out of all of them i like the snark the best
i cannot be sure about other brands and models
a word to best describe it
i have several of them and use them often on many guitars
but it youre looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities
after that your record will sound brand new again
the product comes in a clam shell package
you have to do it from the software
but other than that works as intended
ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain
this power supply is great for me
obviously cardboard isnt going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths
i really like these strings
very low noise repairable effective strain releafthick rubber cover
everything should be this easy to use and work this well
built like a tank and completely configurable
this particular stand is surely made for a very large jumbo guitar
if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it
this is a heavy solid high quality mic
i play resonator guitars open tuned
i like the price because of the special deal from amazon
sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
i also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument
its fast and easy just like a tuner should be
used mildly it gives the sound a more natural feel
so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you
as i said the hardware on the case is really good
i use it on my seagull and it totally works great
ive tried several 34portable amps34
it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine
i have a planet waves strap with studs and i like it very much
epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar
sure but not for this price
have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon
this is not the case with the hd 500
it will put the sound down
i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar
it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic
i found it very accurate
these are three times as high at guitar center
the only suggestion i would make is to have a different soundhole cover
at first it didnt work
essentially a waste of money
highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable
these just happen to be my favorite
well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele
has padding where it needs it to protect guitar
works like the picture shows
i use it often but find it is not very accurate
summarygreat pedal buy it youll probably keep it
the cable clips are a nice touch
the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains
i dont think i would take it on an airline
i think the build on these are fine for daily use
the surface is matte and not too slick
it works perfect with my boss pedals
the tone becomes duller the output drops
just love this little amp
there arent enough uke straps out there for a good price
the snark is by far my favorite
no more thick calouses on the fingers
daddarios are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics
i play a tele and an acoustic martin
looks nice and quality seems nice
so it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for
across the web reviews for the to800 are uniformly favorable
your loop can be as long as 10 minutes with unlimited overdubbing
a lil glue will fix it just havent had time
just so i could make some sort of comment about it
but it does its job
i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off
its awesome to use and efficient
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide
i dont blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
dont waste your money on them
it is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs
the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well
i had always had some issues with it but it was liveable
this not the first swing hanger i have
besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars
when i run it alone to my crate i havent experienced this
you cant go wrong with monster cables
a combination of metal and plastic
this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
it works well i mean it doesnt crumble apart or anything
the key to the onespot is the 1700ma output
i managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck
the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm
excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity
nice addition for the price
nothing bad to say its a fender strap with the hard rock leather look
oh and this goes without saying upgrade the stock strings
im completely amazed with this capo
a straight up product well worth the money
that could be cord issues or box issues
first the material that the neck rests in is very soft
fat and deep snappy when needed
i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin
works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes
it will still hold up with moderate use
moreover theres also a warranty for this item
i really liked this one
and the pockets  oh the pockets
you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz
the sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get
with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers
the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes
when set on blink they blink way too fast
i just bought a rickenbacker 4003 that came with schaller strap locks preinstalled
the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust
love the reverb in the fx section
nice mic to record acoustical instruments
my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings
i have it going into my mixer which works fine
if you use ext mic
the entire material and holding surface is the same material
it costs a buck thirty
some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency
it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive its almost painful
even nimh 12v batteries can power this although alkaline 15v last longer
forget all the volume drop comments
i used this with my samson mixer
new premium strings do make a difference
the rattle just got worse louder as i played
the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes
and to be quite honest ive only been using the presets
90 is very inexpensive for a guitar
they will last and last and last and give you great sound
it has a midsweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone
it is very responsive to pressure
i am a long time user of the big fender triangular picks
this one is very adjustable and stays put
easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass
i used this to tune a coconut thumb piano
invest in a daisy chain spot or the like
simply slide it into position
it holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed
for the money i am not mad i tried it
i am happy with this product
you dont need the expensive ones this works just fine
it is a guitar stand
the tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound
than you normally do and give these bargainpriced nickels a try
the behring us600 is a basic pitch shifter dont expect elaborate effects
it is sensitive and accurate
they ring so bright and beautiful
they look great and fit perfectly
the color advertised was not the one i received
and purchased a license for reaper
im surprised i havent broken it yet
they are the perfect size and shape
but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at soundhole
first the size is perfect in my rack configuration
works good w ableton livedislikes  drum pads
took no more than 10 minutes to install
after a few performances i let go and left the amp at home
i really havent used channel two much
came in perfect working condition
i actually got this for my acousticelectric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it
i have not tested its wind screen capabilities
when this product appeared to be defective i contacted the seller
just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something
measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or so
on stage makes some very nice products
after i plugged this little bad boy in it brought my amp to life
not easy to set up hard to tighten down
it seems to be very durable as well
not too difficult to tune either
install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment
i read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the rogue
not as bright as i would like them however very nice
check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord
seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick
not as much padding as i would like
i am revising my previous review on the 3250ls
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing
this is clearly a case of 34your mileage may vary
since hes 11 he doesnt have many opportunities to play with others
soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level
i just slapped one of these on my reliced 94 mim fender strat
theyre also not for those with smaller heads
it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps
the master and gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel
i recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand
other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50150 and more
and inside that was my lovely new guitar
the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly
i have a few tuners that are somewhat like this gt1 clipon tuner
however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional
they are clueless arrogant and condescending
3 the jam has a gain meter ie an led and a gain control
takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar
ive been using daddario xl strings since the 80s
every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me
perfect perfect size weight shape
but as far as run around and taking lessons
planet waves mandolin strap brown
as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down
it does everything i wanted and the price was right
i also have one for my bass
this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun
you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff
the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link
a lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar
intonation is good and ive noticed less breakage as well
i would love to have a baritone uku of this same design
i just tested if all the plugs work and they do
hohner has been around forever well constructed instrument and very reliable company
this was a filler item for a much larger order
i gigged with it for years without issue
great guitar but could certainly use these tuners
if youre looking for some ridiculous review this wont be one
my ipad lives on this thing
found pedal wasnt engaging when pushed down
they are closer to light than medium
if the unthinkable happened id buy another one in a heartbeat
the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now
this tuner blows away my old guitar professorqwik tune tuner
i love the red the swivel head the green
it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano
overall a decent playstarter uke and worth the 30
but again reasonable minds can differ
ive tried a few different straplock options and these are the best
there are other wonderful strings fremont flouros worths etc
does a great job of checking cords
this is not a lightweight stand
mine has a white case
im in love with the dual design system
a must for every serious guitar player
ill be ordering from musicians friend again
ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years
i will buy another in a second color
it also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic
if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive
needed these accessories to match a brand new fender pick guard
do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs no success
it had been a while since i had some ebs
it just sounds more organic and less sterile than the boss pedal
i didnt think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that
and for less than 25 bucks its a bargain
great tool and good quality product
i thought that if its made by hohner it must be fairly good
no assembly instructions were included in the packaging
the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically
it does it really well with very little to no noise
good cable as good as any expensive brand
using it on an acoustic dreadnought and its plenty long enough
just hit add to cart
basically if you get the right setup youll get great tone
these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most
you do need to hit only one string at a time however
besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost
i cant believe im writing this but its ture
you cant easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues
crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get 34mudded34 out
martins are no doubt excellent strings
my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size
no matter what color the floorcarpetstage is you can find your pick easily
dont leave home without it
the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend 90100usd for a tuner
it looks amazing in use
its even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks
i have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart
i bought this to use with my keyboard
i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine
buy the 20w version which is plenty loud for home
behringer all the way you can keep your expensive boss pedals
it is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike
anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices
i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another
i bought this tuner for my mandolin
from the audacity web site
i can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand
i find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold
this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat
not ready to take the plunge
i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity
it has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician
i play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in columbus ga
you will not be sorry
cant ask much more than that from it
the drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late
it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy
replaced the battery only once
the bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge
i have other similar models and they are all great
there are better out there but its a good value
theyre just as solid as the pricier ones
it wasnt supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look
but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too
it will survive a nuclear blast
it has great sound and distorts like its suppose to
i ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons
you cant go wrong with this stand
they are comparible in tone to dean markelys and slinkys imho
if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one
i was really looking forward to receiving this amp
the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree
other than that for the price its just awesome
the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff
this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned
the tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks
i didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good
i found that out quickly
and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner
great product at a excellent price
they sound just as good as they did a year ago
those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere
its the tube screamer of delay pedals
they would look great on a either a strat or tele
i like the sound of the wound third
its not a big deal
if the behringer dies its going in the trash and ill buy another one
this is an excellent gig bag
the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need
what more can you ask for
but after purchasing i realized that a tool like this isnt too necessary
i bought this capo for mywashburn d10
ive 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsthe intellitouch is simply champion
its quick and pretty on the money
ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine
i didnt even notice a smell
slips right out of every pedal i have
this polytune 2 is amazing  bright accurate strobe option well built
nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad
dont let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you
one other thing it works better if you put it in front
im glad i tried these i wont order them again
if you dont like it get a refund
i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets
its rugged and i like it
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
is it as good as the shure
instead its very edgy and smooth as can be
i have tried the intel krog boss etc
i have an abundance of strat parts
most of the b pedals work quite well
read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many
these tubes just arent for me
its not great but should work as a quiet practice amp
free shipping gotta like thatcons  only one power setting 15v
overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
it is a great option if not simply the best
one certain advantage of the sm58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability
runs forever on a ninevolt battery
really what more can you say
tap twice to stop play of the loop
i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends
for 10 bux each  why not
microphonicnot a big deal it happens all the time
an hour later guess what
i suggest these over the other brands  watch what touring bands use
definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future
real cost saver on batteries
this was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions
spend a little extra on another brand
tried it on a martin d28
they do the job brilliantly
i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas
it would just be nice if it included one is all
it saves room and makes the room look cooler
nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings
a few minutes of rehearsal with it and youll get to like it
this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops
for the price they can not be beat
it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning
folds up and sets up comfortably and easily
throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials
they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend
there are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string
i like making my strings last longer
im not sure if this is normal or not
and then to go out to test some more
this came at no surprise
this is the only type of stand i prefer to use
geat value for the money
the girls will love you and the boys too
ill also note that its even affordable while its brand new
paired with a chorus effect you can get some really cool tones
it will never hurt you it only helps
spot on when used correctly inline with cables
so far this power supply is great
it sits well on any sixstring though is not flat enough for a classical
once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery
these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing
what more can i say
so it was time to get a real wah
however the angle makes that very awkward
you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed
never say no to free stuff
id pay double for these strings all day
arrived on time and as described
the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses
one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune
cant ask for more than that
this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before
seriously are you a child
leds make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range
just give it a little thought
i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material
no feedback or buzz from it
what else can i say
to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts
i dont hate boss and use their superoverdrive in my chain
traditionally the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings
these strings softened the tone which i wasnt looking to do
the head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily
it took a long time to come
will buy another if it ever wears out
so good that i bought another one
proof of this lies in the boss unit i have owned for 20 years
but is more than twice better
its as versatile as can be
its cheap and easy to use
these suckers are wonderfully reliable
decent quality for the price
i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome
i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family
i like the sound quality i get
seems to take a few bangs without problems
perfect for ibanez guitars with special tuning
so this switch is a useful little bonus
im going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars
this tuner is affordable and it works well
each one sat just right
so i like to play with thin gauge picks
however it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim
dont let the system absorbs you
a great move toward a new generation of capos
the h2 unlike my pricey sony can handle both
third buy it if you are looking for a new tuner
better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me
the jam man solo is an amazing pedal
it is very solid and will last a long time
picks make a big difference to sound and playability
also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip
if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it
i figured id get my moneys worth from them regardless
this was bought based on the advice of others
this mic stand is a great value
the build quality of the mic is excellent
thank god i buy spares
this little amp does everything i need for small gathering
but this wouldnt be a very good review without having some cons
the bad news is that this configuration is very buggy
they are black plastic ones
it looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes
just wish the batteries lasted longer
great for acoustic and electric
if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by bossroland
also great for those starting out learning an instrument
love this capo on my electric guitar
nice flexible easy to hold and i received on time at a great price
i recently purchased a epiphone eb3 bass and it didnt come with a casebag
im running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out
as far as the sn8 is concerned
this works exactly as intended and is a perfect size for my ms2000
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
working great on my stratocaster
lately its become my goto tuner
its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades
color is good and as pictured and it doesnt seem to scratch easily
works great for changing guitar strings
sure theyre a little pricy but hey
i will try the sn8 shortly and give this one to a friend
this instrument sells for about 100
its no toy its a real retro electric guitar effects pedal
i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this
good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes
the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiplesized tuners
i do not use it for powering only one pedal though
until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane  aha
good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have
very good price and good performance
i keep it on all the time since it always improves soundquality
the price was just right cam quickly and id buy them again
what you should know about this pedal
if you buy the keyboard youre going to need the power adaptor
i typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars
make no mistake the athm50s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
works well for a multitool
this cup holder does the trick
unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat
it has given me no problem
the whole strap is leatherno adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument
i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars
much better than the one i received with a guitar i ordered
drs last three times as long as daddario
one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are
arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice
seemed too cheap to work
i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound 1000x better
with some acquired technique this tool does a job
these are okay strings for the folk guitar
may work other applications that require the same type of plug
i got this guitar for my 9 year old son he loves it
i needed something with eq on it as well
but this case fits my dot like a glove
students would be especially encouraged to get one of these
does what it is supposed to do
i use the 15 mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years
high quality and great design
this is a great product just not for me
to me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed
and all for 7 bucks w prime shipping
makes a great little practice amp
i bought this strap because i thought the pattern was awesome
holds up great mic does not slip
this little tuner is excellent
i started experimenting on strings ill try using bronze strings
played as well after the change as it did before
looking forward to more tests
they fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads
im glad i bought it
cant go wrong with this one
the action is very good and it will not be any harder to play
foam padded everywhere guitar touches
to be honest im not missing anything
same goes for the boss ds1
theyre as good for speedpicking as they are for strumming
eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should
it make the process of replacing the strings so much faster
the quality of the sound moreover isnt badproviding you can hear it
i you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand
it is not what i received
holds the guitar out at a safe distance
it sucks at that too
i find i do better with heavy thickness
these folks should be embarassed
i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back
they have a great rating from other musicians
just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise
it comes with strings installed and almost tuned
for the cost these are a smoking deal
i have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years
it is even large enough to use with my 12 string
he tunes it to itself
i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
ive only ever dropped an instrument that had strap locks on it
this problem is gone with the new preamp
the sound has better definition
the typical clipon tuner has an lcd needle
you can compare both at guitar center
i know thats bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming
it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable
id describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge
not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago
i would buy another one without hesitation
price with amazon prime is a good buy
is it easier than soldering
there is one concern you may have
these really are direct replacements for the prs se line
i couldnt believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price
probably the best kapo out on the market
maybe those folksshould shell out an additional 300 for something better
i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings
ive had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
anyone needs string go for it
i cant really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one
is good to play rithyms but cant do pretty much nothing else
still a great guitar string
simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it
nothing fancy and not for everyone
it just makes things sound solid
this mic in a studio application smokes them
its plastic so dont jump on it
just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner
this is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal
34  how do you know if you have this finish
if you dont know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack
it is also very sensitive when set to room recording
talking about plugged sound its no where close to unplugged
i intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use
do not use these to polish your guitar
have 2 problems with the strings
i use it as a practice mic
not by any means actually
this is a solid product
the only strings i get are ernie ball strings
i have never experienced a string break in 30 years
the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined
wire frayed at the right angle jack
i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a 6 practice cable
the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button
chrome is great quality and it has good weight so its not tinny
this chromatic clipon tuner is the best of the best
dont even hesitate buying this thing
but not enough to keep it
plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and ive used just about every brand
i take care of my stuff
by todays standards thats as good as it gets
it holds my jazz bass without any problem
as far as tuning goes i am very pleased
the design is simple and easy to understand and use
i bought this guitar nearly a year ago
also the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer
sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesnt make cases
when it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly
fits in your pocket gig bag etc
5 feet same as 6 inches right
these strings are good especially for the price
i love this capo better than any i have seen or used
the drivers gave me no hassle installing and as i said above rock solid
is it equivalent to a boss dynacomp visual sound or keeley compressor
i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup
but i like it so far
heard they were nice strings
the lcd screen is bigger and overall very simple to use
yes i think you should try these
it does a fine job
dont let the size fool you
i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware
gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings
but back to the tuners
but its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them
but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka
i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass
a real workhorse for sure
great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply
it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks
thats only my opinion and everyone has one
brilliant solution to the strap button problem
then again i dont tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as
i pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers
these should last a long time as long as theyre not abused
great feel to them and nice sounding
they need to rethink the design
these strings are my second choice after the elixir 8020 bronze
definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
my guitar is a gibson les paul 2008 standard plus
i like the  setting the best
awesome feel sound and price
footswitch includes channel and boost buttons
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
the amazon price is terrific
i requested this for christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it
its easy to set up
the unit uses three aa batteries
these cables are the only cable i will ever use from now on
again maybe not 750 good but at least 250300 good
easy to assemble and feels solid
the sound out of these things is pristine
i didnt know headphones could sound this good
this are some great strings
what more can you ask for
actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar
first off the amp shipped with bad tubes
far as i can tell good strings
this is a great effect
this one is much better although not quite as portable
if you need one might as well be this one
this really does shine up your wood quite well
the frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good
it really is versatile as well as noiseless
i bought this amp along with a epi les paul 100
dont waste your money on this junk
so far it doesnt look like it will though
this is a great bag regardless of cost
it does make the strap long but is suppose to
my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic
on these i use the lights9s
this amp is well worth the price
this is just a great product
still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter
it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design
takes a matter of moments and works great
high quality does not fray stays on the guitar
my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive
its a bit thinner than the average cable
im pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model
since i bought these i have been using the heavy thickness ones
treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot
if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is
if youre new it helps you find what you like
i always end up using a little fender portable stand
right out of the box this guitar was flawless
screw is actually two pieces wtf
much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others
they all work fine for me
i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks
easy to hang onto when strumming
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
but eventually i figured it out
i use the fender for electric and the behringer for the acoustic for practicing
it has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele
this one seems to consume coincell batteries at an unacceptable rate
at least try a new tube before giving up
these cables work very well at transmitting sound
ive been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great
that would make this one the best
padded to protect guitar neck
this takes a second to get use to
you really cant beat it for the price
love the bright light gauge sound and playability
the angle of the tray is not adjustable
its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it
spend a few more bucks and get a padded one
its just really good and clear and powerful
this is my first set and i am impressed
folds up easy so i can tuck it away
the build quality of the super champ x2 is largely excellent
i had previously been using the korg ga1 which is a fine basic tuner
get it one you will love it
get 2 amps and split the signal even
great tone and tuning stability
i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smellfree case
these and the extra lights are great strings
they must have standard fittings on mikes
two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide
it is a highquality gig bag with lots of padding
more importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedalboard space
the behringer cs400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor
performing nicely with a stock mim strat
just trying to decide what speakers to purchase
they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference
ive been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar
my plan worked and this is a good quality strap to do it on
another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal
weird suggestion   hang on to the box it comes in
i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player
your sound will come out through your speakers as intended
i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar
these babies are dead quiet
otherwise this is a nice strap
a very attractive and well constructed strap
thats about as trouble free as ive seen in this type of device
so why only three stars
i even recently bought a 2nd just because
great padding yet still lightweight
they come unfinished but well sanded
all in all im very pleased with the dg ghss
this is one pedal that will stay on my board
this may have been the best money ive ever spent for a guitar accessory
its still a very nice guitar though
thatll make it loud enough for most bars
if used correctly this mute works well
the usb cable is just a type b port
been using it for a month or 2 now
there is a big drop in the freq
think of this as an artists tool
seems like it is part of the design
i have been using audacity which is a free download
oh well i got stuck with two microphones without onoff switch
but dont get me wrong its still pretty strong
fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice
5 stars for price quality features amazon
this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar
the quality is fine and it does what its supposed to do
if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss
i do not have giant hands so large should fit
once again the controls are easy and direct
it gets crackling knobs going again
i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is
works great and easy to use
i took the plunge and ordered one
im only sorry i preordered only two sets at 1249
not all picks are made the same  some are far better than others
i paid 97tax for my gcb95 cry baby and it was worth every penny
first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid
they work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips
and i say duh huh really
i will definitely buy more of these in the future
it appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument
since i paid about 13 for this i was not expecting a great deal
not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out
it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price
it was the perfect choice
im using this with five pedals and it works great
i will probably always use these
what can you say about an adapter cord
see my review of that item for clarification
some sound best with 8020s
in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings
these are amazing little inexpensive mixers
the headline says it all
it works as a beginner tool but only that
its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage
if you are a beatle fan this is such a cute item
not to mention how great they look
you cant beat the price
i was previously using a blue usb snowball
i tried it and the quality is low end
raising it is a different story though
nice part is it works on all stringed instrument
add 6 picks and start rockin
it is small and doesnt look like a huge lump on the headstock
you wont be disappointed at all
over all im happy with the purchase as it suits my needs
no corner protectors on this
everything rolled into one product
but considering the price thats understandable
if so have a few of these on hand and replace that nut
i also have the very first jamman with the add on 3 button footswitch
good for acoustic and electric guitars
they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them
the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise
before judging this pedal please experiment on its placement on your pedal board
this is a great pedal to put at the end of your fx chain
great unit for the price
but the more i use it the better feel i get for it
as far as accuracy its right on in either setting
ive learned the hard way that there are some things you dont skimp on
this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar
this works great for micing guitar amps
i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u2 etc
reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit
a little nicer than i thought it would be
this does just what it says it does
this will help you figure things out
one of these recorded perfectly also
for guitars its not as good as hercules
i like to experiment with different types of picks
darn near as near to an uncoated string that youre going to find
additionally mine came very well setup from the seller aside from the inevitable tuning
that said for the price it is an excellent product
id buy these again in a heart beat
i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast
i play often and like to change strings often
this dries quickly every time
these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm5758 series form factor
hosa guitar cables work great
the only negative is the way they seem to be packed here
it feels little bit stiffer than regular
i got it for my les paul epiphone uke
it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on
i still love these things
it is fitted snugly and well made
however when it comes to tubebased pedals big is par for the course
i bought a set of these to try them out
it is well built and sturdy
i picked up an old boss me6b that required the boss bra120 power supply
otherwise the size of the dialface the clip itself is precisely the same
the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke
i will have to use an acoustic preamp
the snark unlike the korg tunes by vibration
this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster
so that is the downside
i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries
that would be a mistake
you cant go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick
sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on
you feel different when there is a stand holding the mic
thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars
this is just your typical nylon strap a bit stiff but durable
what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone
i play for fun and relaxation
i use this for a microphone and it seems to be solidlybuilt
i had the ones that came with my strat which i believe are schallers
its a value at full price also
i wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after i change guitars
i have 2 of these actually
in some situations they can be a savior during set up
it makes a dynamic mic sound great
enhances string life and tone
if you have a very high end guitar this might not work
the micro adjuster is easy to adjust
really reliable great sound got no complaints here really
this is a very good quality nice sounding delay
i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs
so for a good price you get a filter that works
ive banged mine around a bit and its stayed in one piece
and on the downside made in china
i have bought several of their models
all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it
i just wish i had a better feeling about the premature breakage
i especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner
the screen is so dark and only viewable head on
so dont want 9s and 10s too tight then 95s it is
they are also easy to do bends which i like alot
which means it does what it was designed to do
after adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great
i still check but they just wont pull out or release
this item has sewnseamed edges that will not fray
i play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great
these strings are quite durable and longlasting
i will use them again in the future
i am so glad i did
2 the bass cut and presence boost are convenient
if you strum  play softly then pluck  tune each string softly
ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day
nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible
this little amp kicks major ass dood
i sold it after using it for about a year or so
same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with
nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your back
output is not a problem if you are amplified
sticks are well organized and always in reach
definitely a great value for the money
right now its a mere 45
and oh my it records good
i own several acoustic  electric guitars
this shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick
not sure how they will last time will tell
some complained about each band boosting others
the best sound i got was on my lp
nothing but the best going on this guitar including this plate
i would recommend to anyone
vox has never really made great modeling stuff
considering i spent 600 for itit rules
besides that i am totally stoked and happy with these
admittedly i havent had the time to try this one out
compared to my other tuner its rigt on the money
overall i think this is a great product
guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features
i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol
a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar
this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
you cant go wrong with this
not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar
one reviewer says its made by fender
the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust
the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords
it is portable so i always have it with me
i would recommend this to anyone
no issues at all and would order again
have used them for years
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
i know ive owned another set for more than twenty years
record using a headset or youll get too much feedback
i have used it for several months with no problems
warranty runs for a year
but it definitely gives you the effect
fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar
the snark sn1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate
they are very longlasting and sound great
each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky
for those folks these will elimiate the resulting pings and such
not the end of the world but i just dont understand why
im changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star
its essentially a 9v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light
its made in china but isnt most everything these days
there is such a thing as too much
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do
definately get an adapter for this
pros its small and lightweight
thats where this product comes in
i would recommend it to anyone
it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too
this guy filled the need
this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly
i have always loved line 6
i own and use them both
good unit for the money for sure
is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence
very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue
under the strings and it muffled a few
so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks
you could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig
i bought a second one
brings your instrument into deadon ringing true tune across the instrument
but good product and price
this is without a doubt the best guitar tuner i have ever used
onebutton operation makes it simple to operate
the martin name is synonymous with quality
theres too much tension to do it with your fingers
i am however an electric gitty player primarily
even at the price its sold at the build quality is pro level
for the price and quality i would buy two other ones
one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ
midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasnt cutting it
i have had no problems with them at all
i went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times
great product worth every penny
i got this duet2 instead of the singlelight version as most kindle users do
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well
ok so they are just screws
coulda had a veggie drink
i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses
i only use something different if i need a longer reach
very sturdy and awesome pop filter
i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother
fortunately i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve
these rubber picks metal picks etc
this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound im looking for
i do not know if it will fit other guitars
i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage
in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have
however i found it can only be attached in one place
it goes from slapback to space shot very easily
it is adjustable for standing and sitting
again i feel line i work for dunlop
they are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible
your guitar will be fixed surely
have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar
fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time
for a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat
the guitar fits it fine
that having been said im pleased with them as a string for guitar practice
clean low noise im used to the controls and love the sound of it
i purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason
ive used these strings longer than any other strings ive tried about 7 years
it is great that amazon stocks these making ordering convenient
i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy
i would highly recommend this especially at the price
these are very well constructed and function very well too
several other combinations are excellent too
and roundwounds just didnt have that acoustic sound
it gives a variety of sounds
its at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe
what more is there to say
only thing make sure you read the description well
despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely
this kit does the trick and truly was easy to use
but do consider you means of mounting carefully
i own several small tuners including the enote nano tuner and the snark
theyre fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent
the downside for me is not the guitars fault
they are much better then the original strings
i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires
it has to feel right
to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way
i surely will continue to experiment
switchcraft is usually a good product
theres enough reviews on here that state the obvious
tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect
it leans wayyy too far back
this helped them all to stay in place even better than before
while being light and portable
i just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference
i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus
it is very sturdy and very stable
the 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone
nope doesnt fit a squire affinity just fyi
only slightly better than 05
large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch
it is very snug on the strings
these have become my favorites
they said well mine was only 45 and mine was only 40
not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well
something i didnt consider when ordering a uke
i find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things
really these things are great
they tuned right up with very little stretching
so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something
it has lasted for over a year and the battery hasnt died yet
i have more expensive cables but rather use these
this capo looks great and does the job
i really like this strap
it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case
the high gain channel is really fat sounding
tons of useful information on this wheel
the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar
i bought these strings to try on my guitars
i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band
the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome
i would look for something else if i didnt already have this
the 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel
it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right
these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion
it has a great tone
and the adapters never used em
the display is nice and bright as well
good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ xd
it fits the guitar nicely
great customer service and love the pics
i have never been much of a fan for coated strings
now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter
sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work
this was the first time ive ever used a string winder and cutter
like it can do all this crazy cool stuff
crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous
but unless you are new to guitar you know that
the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar
i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit
ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job
they are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding
it worked out of the box
cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable
they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager
i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good
and this thing is easy to use squeeze put on neck done
might be some sort of powdercoating as well
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design
it also allows you to knock the heck out of it
so i cant speak to its durability at this time
filters out noise well when using the mic
the push down applicators dunlops dabomatic applicator tops are horrible idea
i bought this unit because my amp doesnt have reverb
these guitar picks are just the best
the board itself is made out of welded metal and its very sturdy
tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank
they are stainless steel and very smooth
im neutral on this one
got them today and put them on a wasburn x series
i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician
they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights
ive had it for about six years
he paid about 350400 for his kit still cheap by todays standards
they sound good on a variety of models like sgles paul rickenbacker
i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer
ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings
his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use
what does anyone really want to know about a string winder
may buy another for a spare
this is a really good patch cable
50mm are perfect for me
in fact its the worst contaminant ever
i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one
my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively
works well easy to install and take out
i like this a lot
it also powers everything else and looks fine doing it
sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti
they are quick to release and adjust and fit very well
only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer
it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down
used them for years  always loved them
only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds
this attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter
when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it
whats the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast
the title says it best its a decent basic mic cable
see my previous evaluation on a similar product
try them if its quality sound that youre looking for
these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors
i say why pay more
the price on amazon is awesome
good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead
it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable
but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer
it all came off pretty easily
i would recommend it to others to try
its a must for any rambunctious guitar player
will confess that id like a 12string but thats another animal
not a slam on the productthats just the nature of the beast
this stand really is pretty tough
bought it to hear how my harmonicas would sound amped
i keep one in each case
just arrived in good shape
my go to strings from now on
not so pleased with the sound quality
was recommended to these picks by other users so i gave them a shot
by the way i have a gdec 30 for sale
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws
the frequency band is not identical to the sm57 as some others have said
i cant comment on how long theyll last or keep in tune
the mic end of the mount works pretty good
anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing
it has cushin padding so my guitar is safe  its small but stady
it is a ratchet rather than a clamp
but i probably wont get these again
this guitar with amplug just sound amazing
great deal on great strings
only on first 4 strings may be
how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating
unfortunately theres no 22nd fret on this guitar
these really are a good set of strings
i used to have trouble holding on to picks
simple idea but a good one
however these ones are great
after owning it for several days the draw 2 hole went flat
for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well
this microphone stand it a fairly good buy
i put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise
i just held down the setmarker  record button while plugging the usb cable
so 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction
as with any other boss pedals its well made and reliable
i like much more than the joyo fuzz
it doesnt appear to change the sound quality or tone
i bought these as spares and they look really cool too
it is a good cheap addition to my effects board
i play 2 gigs a week on average and practice everyday
hosa makes good stuff this is no exception
i use it every gig now no problems
i placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer
seems a tad flimsy but time will tell
highly recommended for the adventurous uke player
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
i had never used strap locks before and dont think i will again
i am quite pleased with this product
this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack
a sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too
anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill
this is the best invention since the wheel as far as im concerned
its construction is extremely solid and its heft gives it stability
wait you can call people with an iphone
these were a very nice find
theyve got a great product for the price point
i have tried it several times and it just doesnt tune right
in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient
it actually reclines back fairly far
these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people
would recommend this brand to anyone
the grips come off the neck on my acousticbut works better on my electric
features  stable base good extension easy hand grip to lockunlock for adjusting
speaking of those knobs they seem a little rickety
this is one great looking cable
a must to keep wood looking fresh
i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out
i have used a few different capos this is far and away my favorite
would not buy it for my own guitar
the light from the leds has a blue tint to it
regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing
but first some details about the tuner
the only string ill use
i tested the microphone on a phone call using google voice
highly recommended also fits on my guitar stand very cool
after reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what i needed
saludos  a todos desde venezuela
i tried it for ipad
newer models seem a bit beefier
i think these will be what i play from now on
i only just received these but thought id give my first impression
a lot of bands i have seen on the road use these straps
i have 4 guitars and they each get played once every couple weeks
ive had this pedal for about five years
could choose any note since its chromatic
well made feels very strong
the replacement amp exhibited the same problems
i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination
got this for my electric guitar
if youre a froosh fan like me than look no further
keeping the pick clean and dry does help
all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last
this is not an easy fix but it is doable
a lot of nice features
this one is the worst
2  it wont clean up when you turn your guitar down
i would definately buy more
i know daddario loves the color coded ends
there are other brands but our reputation is at stake
this is really a great amp for the price
other than that the strings are just a little squeaky
you can program it to whatever midi values you want
prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping
im a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher
ill decide which to use round or half wound after my experiment
i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply
this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut
i think youll like this guitar enough to not knock it around
ends are not too bad and it works for what it is
oh and and the cost
you guessed it  distortion
the light is twolevel  normal and bright
but without it i felt cheated
at the time i had never owned a big muff
so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything
after each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers
the playback sound is very good quality
use them all the time
got the fender ft004 instead
the eq effect just kills the pedal for me
im using it more then i thought i would when i first bought it
to use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks
id give this baby six stars if i could
these are durable but i get some noise from the cables
oh did i mention this is a very good looking guitar
fast response on all strings including the low b on several five string basses
all the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid
only thing keeping it from 5 stars
is the the best pedal ever
i replaced the factory strings with these
you simply attach the dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar
i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming
and even play your mp3 player while you play and sing
theyre easy to get on and off
they will be none the wiser
havent had this long but so far its just about perfect
u wont be happy either
they dont cost a lot and they work well
this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass
the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish
after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case
thanks to amazon for the quick service
i have always loved hercules products
definitely provided extra gripping surface
cons tuners may or may not slip when playing hard
theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which im happy with
i was surprised that it was good
the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there
has great pockets to carry your picks strings and tuners
very nice grip on these
overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother
i prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway
not much else to say
unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin
it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic
played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now
that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all
features i like  lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
i played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonationfret buzz etc
one doesnt get much better than daddario strings
the plastic is pretty lightweight but it is a big help
someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid
buy one learn how to use it and youll be happy
works as intended and maybe more
the music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion
fast accurate and a joy to use
only issue in tuning drop d or b on a 5  string bass
i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r16
try it and i think youll like it
i prefer it to the 58 seems a bit more bright and natural
you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner
again it works perfectly for my situations
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good
i think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles
second would be an fx loop
they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone
i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps
i like the right angle connectors
they play and sound softer
i got this item much quicker than i expected
does exactly what it says itll do
install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze
i guess im just too used to the big pick
i bought anew bow for 62100 so
ive been using these strings for years
its all about personal preference so
alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like hendrix
it is exactly what it says it is and works fine
think lightning crashes by the band live
its so simple a child can use it
a nice extra piece of flexibility
not a big deal but worth mention
these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing
the result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars
i also gave it the nose test
pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument
i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings
the clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built
i used a 38 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully
it isnt completely black though
never fear you need to see this film
im a beginner harmonica player and this was perfect for me
do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers
they dont know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings
it is a euro stand so it has 5827 threads
its a fingerprint magnet but thats about the only gripe i have
i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on
ive got another one on one of my banjos
ill have them with me for spares
i know it can do standard tuning i just cant figure it out
no complaints its quiet enough and the price is right
they complement my washburns very well
my fender stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag padded well too
i used it for several years but it is only a backup now
hard to day too much but it works great
these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks
update  this pedal has since been returned
another thing is the price point which is simply amazing
very good tray to put small items
one section of this wheel lists all of these different scales
like a cranked tube amp
i bought this for my new 12 string guild acoustic
changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore
i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars
this came today and i must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly
i play a taylor 414ce
now rocking and basic recording its how its supposse to be
i like the feel and the control it provides
nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all
i use this light for music sheets documents and books
these sound good by that i mean they dont have any sound at all
the evans pedal patch will work for you great
this review was for the old models
when it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner
about half the size of a regular pick
my only small complaint is that they dont use a center punch
i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great
it is easy to hold and is a good product
the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things
have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker
firstly let me address the 34adjustable backrest34
had the battery not been an issue i would have rated this 5 stars
i cant brag on them enough
it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment
thats not uncommon among studio monitors
i love having two mic inputs and the cd input
in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box
this one offers almost no protection
this little recorder is absolutely amazing for its size
for 40 its an awesome deal
all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups
thats at the 25 gain setting
easy to navigate and understand
the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should
daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money
it wont break the bank and it wont break your back
will buy again with other size
fits in most guitar cases  is lightweight
some days i hate it
you open up the back of the pedal  choose you own setting
the only drawback is you cant have your ipad in a case
the sound is a bit brighter
there are however a few limitations
this bottle will probably last me 10 years
i figured he could start simpler
i only use aquila strings on my instruments
but lets quest after some serious bigleague sound
should last her a very long time
the implications of this amp are really huge
using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks
that being said the materials are decent
it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space
it was an 34uh duh34 moment
but i am sure other people may disagree
i feel 100 secure that my guitar will not fall
i cant really tell the difference between the sn1 and the sn2
i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner
as it stands i give them 45 stars
you will not be disappointed
it also appears that the tuner wasnt reliable on the pitch end either
this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
the leather is thick and supple
my capo could not even hold them
therefore after playing i always wipe down my strings to extend their life
first i dont know how they sell these for the price they do
the amplifier use three tubes  1x 12ax7 and 2x 6v6s
so theyre good sounding strings and they last a long time
like i said i love these things
worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed
i have a 57 reissue strat and i cant tell the difference
will purchase an extender to use with it
the secondposition for the harp in c is g not terribly common
34  but i lost it
the microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand
fantastic for slide or capod high
line in  usb buttons somewhat confusing nonintuitive
but i do like the rotation of the display
dunlop makes good quality products
but this product was a waste to me
this has also help me in tuning the violin
snark solves all of these problems
even though i ordered large
if you have no sense of smell get one
playabilty is very good with low action and good tone
that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light
you can lock each strap button with one hand great product
at 3 for a dozen theyre worth a try
c level control provide from ve to high ve boost
many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed
this is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment
i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks
i hope there had been a closer picture of the product
so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar
cannot go wrong with this one
went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle
i have returned the unit
im glad i purchased this when i did
you will not regret it
the one i got kept cutting in and out
im not sure about battery life i havent gotten there yet
i compared these and other daddarios to other manufacturers
i always use martin on any acoustic
these were purchased for my parts bin
however at amazons current value price for this particular monster cable its a nobrainer
is a great way to change the sound of your guitar
is it typical of jj to have more headroom
this multiplug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what id been searching for
perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar
all in all it was a good upgrade and id do it again
the price is also right and i recommend
im an older guy who has been playing for approximately 50 years
the hardware is decent but i wouldnt expect the hinges to last forever
bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer
i got what i expected with my purchase you will too
otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me
it has great tone and sustain wonderful harmonics
but for now i am very pleased with this tuner
annoyance 2   this is a 20 watt amp right
i only use about 7580 percent
the color is nice and bright
this fender cable is the perfect length for me
i write and record my own music
i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike
works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from amazon
the seat is very soft and comfortable
a dab will do ya
im so glad i was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago
first time using item and it broke
i break high e strings on occasion
its clean bright and loud
purchased for hanging two rockband pseudo guitars
in all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick
i had changed my strings with some new martins i got recently
it was cheap and affordable
if youre boss you need the info
some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway
highly recommend this for the guitar player
my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them
and this is the best price ive found
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved
ive used daddario strings for years and they never fail me
update  july 8 2012
an all around tough mic
i used to buy leather straps but not any more
so i returned it and they lost the sale
nothing more to say but it said i needed 1 more word
accurate or inaccurate not good or bad theres a difference
this is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp
thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasnt very happy
only complaint is the stacking of the six effects onto just two knobs
it feels like the iphone of delay pedals to me so far
they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter
i have played full time for over 27 years
whatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture
compression smooths over these problems and levels everything to a polished presentable sound
try different brands to find what suits you best
its a really good deal at the price
im satisfied with these picks
seems to work just fine for my needs
there are also with two dimples
i am very pleased with the 34new sound34 of my tele
they make two  a 3430034 and a 3440034
for 99 it is a steal
i first used this pedal when my green screemer died
it is solid but light weight enought to move as needed
this is the most ive ever spent on a guitar strap
but not if you use such a device regularly as many homeplayers do
you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp
it feels well constructed like it wont break if i drop it
after looking at 34reviews34 i like this one the best
is sturdy and good for price
only downside is theres no neck support
does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal
press again and it begins playback
little harder to read than i would have liked especially in sunlight
i wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didnt
nothing but chinese crap for sale anymore
for it being pretty cheap i had to get it
i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit
they even had velcro reuseable tape to hold them 2 each
does what its supposed to do
the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge
then your oktava will fit just fine
that is an easy fix
it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune
it just uses vibration of the instrument
outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time
the case is solid albeit plastic
at first i played it with my line 6 15 watt amp
the behringers go for 15000 while the mackies go for about 25000
most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for
very playable right out of the box and very beautiful
some say that the grip is good
assembling is simple and fast
i grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed
very solid and i feel comfortable hanging my taylor 414ce in this
the dimensions are  41l 14w at bout and 3 deep
he can create jamclick tracks and play along
however i would not change out a working 3way switch for this
the stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe
this one is just a waste of money
i highly recommend this petal
it gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft
holds the strings down perfectly too great capo
thats not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps
nice sound in the acoustic too
it actually holds a couple of picks less
i have the kt7800 which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust
easy to get on and off
this does what you expect it stands up a guitar
as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means
i needed to run my boss gt100 and vocals through it on stage
i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about 2 years
amazing the besti cant believe
most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass
i was also hoping that it played well
i would recommend this product
if i lost this box id immediately order another one
final blurb  my feelings about this amp are mixed
i will stick with the schaller in all 3 colors
since purchasing them they still ring nicely
it comes two in a package
first is the bass and treble controls
i wish it had at least one more inch
anyway ive been playing guitar for about 15 years
i dont plan on moving it so it works for me
a must have for any guitar player
1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack
why are you still reading this
that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time
i gave these strings a try but i dont care for them that much
sure there should be nicerbetter product but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks
it doesnt do many different tones but what it does it does very well
all i own are mogami cables
this fit the bill perfectly
in fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days
i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did
obviously not everyones head and neck are the same as mine
sound is clear and crisp
it hardly generates any dust and gives the bow that extra grab
the behringer monitors do the job well
great sound quality and durability
it has a nice big pedal for big feet
i got way more than i bargained for
i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness
just found out the best part of this amp
it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for
perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyones pedal board
although its a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while
i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot
theyre holding up very well
tried others but i prefer these
ive been happy with all of gls products so far
the back clamps firmly to the guitar without maring the finish
it is very annoying doesnt work very well and looks pretty dumb too
it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying
for the price however you should not expect any better
these are 3999 each at a local music store so
i read the reviews on ernie ball strings
but the main this is that it worked
well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa
i have it custom mapped for multiple softwares
this thing uses tiny smc components in the circuitry and therefore isnt really moddable
but that means the guitar is very secure so i am very happy
but you cant ask for much more for the price of 399
bought this rosin to see how i would like it
i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this
i am old school and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful
this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed
the major problem with these is they arent large
i have no complaints about the construction the looks or the price
with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use
this is a great little tuner and i am glad i bought it
great sound quality meets full expectations
never owned an ocd but i dont need to
this is a very accurate tuner
its easy to uphook one and hook the other
i could not be happier
otherwise a wonderful product at a great price
anyway it all comes down to preference i suppose
also each instrument is different each peg is different
but a quick dialin with the electronic tuner brought that right
but you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you
and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc
i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti
amazon had it and at a good price
maybe thats just a matter of taste but otherwise this is a great stand
i bought these because i wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming
ive always tuned my ukuleles by ear
visually they dont appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings
now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice
i would have preferred something different
these strings are great for a 12 string
the only place is on the box after you have received the item
this is as good as other devices that cost 34 times more
the english instructions arent really useful as the pedal itself is selfexplanatory
supposedly a new tightener design is on the way
a nice strap for my lower tier guitars
for this price 15 you simply cant go wrong
i am really liking the size of this board
this is exactly what i was hoping for
it sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made
my favorite is this delay and the echo
it really seems well engineered and made of quality material
take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music
the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesnt move at all
aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful
i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap
you can also just clip it to a nearby desk
the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside
for regular sized picks its a perfect product
build it to your specs and have a solid stand
this polish works well for what i need it for
i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink
i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings
why not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffs
i did a little experiment
and its so cheap it wouldnt matter if you lost it
this is such a simple great tuner
pulse there rocksmith endorsed lol
helps keep those ugly microphonics away and you want that big time
not that many good productsaccessories for ukuleles
and these headphones fit well
the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders
i really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it
then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output
itd been about 6 years since ive had an electric guitar
other than that the strap is of good quality
youll wonder how you ever played without it
they now ship without the clips
the product itself is excellent
i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound
and it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my ta50r
these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good
the only problem most people find is the material that its made of
easy to see easy to use easy to get used to
latest review the product is back at 5 stars
i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends
i am very satisfied with these cords and would highly recommend them
its very cool that it has 5w 1w and
these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool
this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied
these are my favorite brand of strings
the bars are easy to see and are accurate
this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for
as you can imagine i need to practice a lot
there is a double sleeve and a single sleeve
by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic 300b
i own over a dozen overdrive pedals
ive got a gig tomorrow night so well see how they work then
i think it would do fine in a live setting as well
the enclosure is a smaller pedalboardfriendly size
fortunately things have changed for the better
i cant wait to see what they do next
why would you do that boss
definitely worth the price you pay
how self adjusting can they be
when i got it in it didnt work
simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings
im not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp
nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though
it arrived well padded in a double box
it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe
it goes with us when we travel with our guitars
great value and quality for 11 i spent ever
works great especially for the price
has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too
i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting
sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and its okay
more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for
whats great about the dunlop design they work
i havent used the cable yet but it looks new and durable
ive used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d18 for several years
i shouldnt have to feel like this thing just barely fits me
you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs
i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way
besides batteries arent that expensive
i like onstage and own several of their products
i love the dunlop formula 65 polish and cleaner
but it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones
you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product
very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable
i have to say it is one good funny lookingclip on tuner
uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter
the secret is always use the least you can get away with
i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings
i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music
would i get another one
havent found any others that sound and feel so good
i choose this one because it was very durable
especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable
also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove
we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it
stable and precise pick attack
keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lintfree cloths
and the sound is good
they shorted me a gold screw
install it and you never have to worry about it again
i bought a few for different basses and guitars
they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass
i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well
its a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup
a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceage sounding
save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this
what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen
i just ordered mine two weeks ago
when it dies i will buy another one
top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable
be aware that this clutch has only two positions  open and fully closed
hard to describe but if youre used to playing nickle youll notice the difference
best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals
they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas
and i love the sound of these strings
its a big step up from that one
other than that these are great monitors
plays great to the top fret
for me i prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric probably a
these are currently the only cables i use on my pedalboard
i purchased this to use with my old yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele
i just got this to run my passive pa
it claims to stop 34string talk34 when you rub fingers on wound strings
love their xlr microphone cables too
daddario prelude violin string set 44 scale medium tension is good deal for beginners
behringer used to be known as junk but no more
i occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls
i give them an excellent rating
it does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice
save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand
i have been playing guitar for 30 years and these are the best
i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under 5 minutes
i bought this after watching a professionallooking youtube demonstration of it
i love this little box
save your money and steer clear of this one
i have recently been very impressed with some of behringers products
by definition medium is an in between size
if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it
but i loves me my musicman
i use this capo all the time on both instruments
its pretty harsh in tone  kind of a white noise distortion
great for a quick look in between songs
the more  you spend the better
rarely have to re tune with this one
thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric
i hope you are getting the idea
cutter winder and pin puller
if youve read some of my other reviews you know im a serial hotrodder
the design is solid well made and will go the distance
very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs
it will never stand in the position like in the photo
these are a staple on every single guitar in our band
which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring
watch youtube to compare models
it gives you great sound for solos
this is a good purchase
i was not a fan of this particular capo
all have their good and bad points
supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar
buy it you will have a ball
you can also stack the cm2 with other pedals
the display colors are bright and easy to read
this amp cable is perfect
the title pretty much says it all
im going to get another one before they decide to raise the price
when fully extended the arm cant hold the entire weight of the shockmountyeti microphone
i was expecting a soso mike for the price boy was i surprised
i dont really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described
these guys are rocksolid and really easy to install
it has less granularity in the display for example
bought another one for my friend
for one thing this is a guitar ill always enjoy having around
it is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back
this is a high quality microphone
at the sale price of 119 this cant be beat
especially on the low end
the tuning is accurate the lcd screen is clearly visible it works great
the case is kick ass too easily a 50 value
not much else to say about it
today i had one of those finds
the price is great too
the problem is it doesnt do both at the same time
pro removes friction for faster playing
highly recommend to everyone looking for a case
very very loud electric guitar amp
previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums
they are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet
these clips are 116 in
will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day
first off if you are planning on buying the us322 dont
i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way
many seem to complain about the plastic housing but im fine with it
for me this is the best guitar tuner
ok quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic
give these a try if youre looking for some new strings
if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have
im glad i bought it just wish it didnt come with the stains
made of all metallooks and feels well made
i love these cheap little pedals
i completely agree with that
that is what i notice most from the hds compared to the regular
i use mine for recording and some performance
again i reiterate maybe its just me
ive seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead
not sure why i did not try them earlier
this device sounds okay its usable
i also other boss distortion pedals
i use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg
also  for my baritone ukulele
these strings actually save you money because you dont have to change em much
i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings
the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling
kind of like using a gm part on my 68 chevelle
the 2i2 is a simple setup
i used this along with a dunlop dc adapter and it all fits nicely
the packaging materials said that i should have received a cd in the package
i would like to let people know they are very stiff
all i know is that it just isnt working very well for me
this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound
ive plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too
still i think is a good tool to have
a mono mic jack no other inputs
that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp
it has performed better than i had expected
bright and warm at the same time
however it doesnt appear to hold anyone with excess weight
i got these for the build in pop screen
the em600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps
i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites
very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass
very smooth and lasted me a while
it now rest at bottom of a box
boutiqueesque is how i would characterize it
i can practice without lighting up the whole house
the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control
the two violins we ordered came on time and were packaged very well
something clipon would have been more useful
and yes its still in one piece
would i try another pick if the chance was presented
as far as the sn8 is concerned
the unit itself seems sturdy and well made
its a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it
the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem
ill definitely only buy these from now on
youtube videoed how to do it
i cant believe i never thought of buying colored cables before
the quality of this mic is just ok
it is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock
this is a fun pick
clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well
ive had this amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great
im betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it
its only a guitar hanger
well i must say this thing rocks
first its all tube so it sounds really good
not sure what thats about
with these pins the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it
this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does
ive done a good bit of recording over the years
nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive
my experience with these straps has been great
this guitar is extremely well made and put together right
the reviews on amazon helped as well along with youtube demos and guitar mags
it also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose
a true hidden gem thats actually cheaper than a ds1
pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards
these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them
this is a really nice item and i got two of them
i put a set on my strat and tele
the sound quality isnt the greatest but thats to be expected
this seller is worth supporting
not the best but not the worse
the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm
i actually like this bench a lot
fender cords look great and work just as well
guitar pics as the gods of rock intended
so grab a pack and get jamming
this might be the most expensivefeeling device i own
id recommend it for finding what suits you
this pedal has three preamp settings  ts9 hot  and turbo
tusq saddles and nuts are the best synthetic out there
you could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10
the package was really well don e and arrived in good time
it does exactly what i needed it for
this amp is something else
i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones
my band had no pa or mics or anything
i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58
nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq
but i have to say its well worth the price
this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down
other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing
the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in
this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting
perhaps i got the wrong thing
good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar
this cable only works with dynamic microphones
i have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy
what looks like a spring actually is a spring
mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters
i would expect that from an asian knockoff not from an alist gear maker
b  recorded dr40 and printed to cd
cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound
and its super easy to apply
ive even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water
great chromatic tuner at a great price  i love it
if it works properly and it does what more can you say
i have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way
wow these cables are made really sturdy
so i snapped one up just like everyone else
these are by far my favorite picks
however range of motion is on the wide side
if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model
i love this thing love it love it
i ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass
they work well for that
its also perfect for adding vocal effects to small barebones pa systems
that said this thing is rock solid
it came with savarez strings  not the best ive used but good
easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path
ive only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so
i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily
where else can you get a greatfunctioning delay pedal for this price
this is it right here
i didnt notice any difference to the feel of the string
for the price its amazing
yet it is a capo structured very well
the leads are actually a little too long but thats a good thing
they dont cut the string they shear it off
thankfully i dont change strings too often
if it didnt i would not buy boss product period
it is also handy portable and easy to take places
someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment
this one is harder to lose because of its size
the bench is very sturdy and comfortable  the cushioning is thick and soft
it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl
for the price this is amazing
i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this
buy youll love it and if not you can always return it
not enough of a hassle to send it back but worth mentioning
this thing can get really loud
they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool
thanks guys will be shopping with you again
it should last a lifetime
the double stick tape that came on it has worked well
this is the best clip on tuner out there
i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical
it feels solid looks like a real direct box
the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use
it gets the job done and seems durable for my needs
these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look
seems sturdy enough to last a long time
i used 220 grit sandpaper
overall this is a great pedalboard
great foot rest i recommend it
a great addition to an already great amp
i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar
i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels
this product works the way it should be
the great part about it is the design
but i received this uke defective
you need at least 60 db of gain the spec sheet actually says 59
the a string too doesnt project as much as the standard strings
for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders
this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track
they felt exactly the same in fact
this new fender straplocks make installing them on the strap easy
they just rob your tone
these are great lights for music stands
there is no way this is true bypass
then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me
move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune
what the hell is the plural of lexus
i have dozens of them they never wear out
it is very small  a little bit larger than a grape
second time buying the 6 pack  great deal for the price
but on this profx8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up
this is a black sponge for smaller mics
the arms are adjustable so the instrument wont rest on the pegs
if you play with nails and want finger picks these are for you
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
that said its lovely to see the strings true in
mine broke and so did my friends
this is a great effect
ive played through the amp for a couple weeks now and its great
it was just what i needed to give me clean sound
simply it does what its supposed to do for a low price
then youre left with several pieces to schlep
it does a nice clean job for the recording i have gotten done
works great stays out of the way
not a pretty product but good stuff
it feels a bit cheap but then it is cheap
if you own a dot sheraton or a 335 you should buy this case
you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop
i do not have much to say about this
in that case i would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier
great mic stand for the price
a more odorsensitive person might feel differently
first it works extremely well
another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor
does it give you more sustain
this guitar tuner is simply amazing
i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me
should last a while with good care
overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down
after testing a set i have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars
they do the job and are made well
i found one of these used for half the retail price
i love this guitar strap button
i love em use them daily and rely on them
ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this
this feature alone makes it a musthave for taking full advantage of the amp
i like it as the stars say
sound really nice on my taylor 410ce
not sure if it did improve my sound or not
i have several for our electrics and acoustics
its quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument
these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems
i can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the gb card
i think it is about the actual mass
the electronics are just fine on the guitar i got
another doesnt and is very clean even on the factory preset clean
at this price these cables are a bargain
you wont feel so bad when one falls off the stage  breaks
i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges
endless variations in sound avaialable
its a solid pedal that gets it done
either way it gets you what you want
i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin
no need for a collection of separate tools anymore
at that price its a steal
exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money
i still recommend the mic though
if youre just wanting a toy go for it
these are thin and flexible
its easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not
this cable is a great cable for the price
feels solid and will probably last for many years to come
highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost
i saw this and had to try it
quick release around the neck strap system
for the multi guitar owners i think this is great
this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after
but do yourself a favor and spend another 25 and get something better
for a modest rig or on the road use i recommend this product
its full of sonic options
having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three
especially noticeable in the lower registers
for a cheap pedal i gave this a try
its a bluegrey color and i didnt realize that
i use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars
these cables are just poorly thought out
these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too
i buy these for my son
a real money saver in the long run
this is a very wellbuilt stand
i do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable
i only use this microphone for podcasting
still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast
it does what it should do
they all differ somewhati fell in love with this one the most
the answer to that question is surprisingly good
most manufacturers dont list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed
i really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs
a total loss  and we had no insurance we sure learned our lesson
its not unbearable but if you can find an alternative its probably best
now about the amp itself
i have purchase 2 to see how they were
they should have put it higher up right next to the dial
i bought 4 pcs of these at 8each shipped
other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate
i read in a review that these hold six picks
i have been using these strings for 7 years
after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase
im very happy when i got this gig bag
not much else to say about strings  p
the guitalele measures 2712 x 9 x 234 at their widest points
i had some issues with this guitar when it arrived
ie 12ay7 12at7 and the mullard 12ax7
good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall
unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death
and a hint  some pedals like behringer have a rubber bottom
you dont have this guitar
especially when you take off the guitar for a break
the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for
you can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it
some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation
you cant necessarily go wrong with knobs
i have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on
never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger
other than being a little cheaply built it works great
i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely
i got this pretty fast
but i love the way screen and mount look
this mic has convinced me to  purchase the audiotechnica  at4040
they sounded great all up  down the fret board
it sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords
my bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors
just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last
just one thing  that strap is too big for kids
the yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as youd expect for this price
there is a white stripe running around the outer edge
it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal
for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems
mine did not have this problem
original posting my first mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment
it was an immediate difference
holds your drink just like it says it will
i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon
so these are heavy strings that work well
it is a good fit for the soprano uke
remember to have wifi in order to connect to panadora
all sound really good and completely adjustable
nice gold tips and polished finish for great connectivity
in addition the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob
these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion
they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well
definitely  going back for more
imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity
this pedal is very versatile
even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings
kit that finally went bad
i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage
im always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs
helps greatly to control acoustic feedback
the martin m140 strings are good strings
the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl
its small works well and fairly inexpensive
the only thing missing is a remote
very easy to grip and last long
before we get started i am more pro than amateur
it didnt seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless
i dont know i think so  others may not
couldnt pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price
i really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware
pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion
easy to put on and tune
i was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp
the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand
the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only 20
easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service
they appear to hold up well under constant moving
this pick literally makes you play better
but just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet
i does the job that i wanted it for
this on the other hand is not a lowquality instrument
oooops my bad when i discovered they were only 2 longer
this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money
since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice
but since i solved that problem with the honing stone i was more curious
the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion
i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly
the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen
they took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event
its my go to for chromatic tuner
they give off such a warm tone and are holding up very well
but i have no concerns after using it on two string changes
i expected this shure sm57 knockoff to disappoint me
i bought this stand to mic a kick drum
i will also say that if you can find one used  buy it
the sound from the 65 speaker requires some space to develop
so when my strings wear out i got this
the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well
nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops
replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and im glad i did
this pedal is great help on stage
its as good as it looks
i have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds
came very well packaged and with all the pieces
as another guy said 34not better not bad simply different34 its true
it worked once when i originally set it then kaput
i have finally learned my lesson
these are very bright and clean
especially the acoustic version of these
illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
pretty well in tune up the neck
i am definitely a behringer fan
but for the price 199 its a real gem
bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job
i just cant think of a single complaint
very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals
it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away
the mike in the picture looked bluish to me
it is barely workable for two
the colors and lighting make it very easy to read
but the biggest con is
the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp
lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteries
yes i spent more than i ever have on a pedal board before
flexible good tone good quality
very well made of heavy metal framework
way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic
work much better then the other style of string trees
i am a tech as well as a guitar player
seems like theyll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us
im glad i tried something else
dont know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat
it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer
for instance the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright
never come up short again
this little guy worked just as advertised
the trem function works great
i love wicker on and tone off
think peavey 6505 eq structure
i will probably get another
they are still going strong
glad i chose to purchase this cable
honestly the strings are great
at ten dollars i think its a nobrainer
and im an adult so i can be careful
all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days
it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price
its really the durability that sets these apart
one spot has become the standard
it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely
the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use
i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well
they grip your head snugly without that horrible 34vice grip34 feeling
at this price range this little effects pedal does admirably
all 12 picks were there
you can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually
i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle
the foam fits nicely around your ears conforming to the contours of your face
ive taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately
giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth
the display is easy to read
no fancy designs but a great value for the price
i wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play
i feel like i am playing with a nickle
i was short a shock mount for one of my cad condensers
i replaced my delay foot pedal with the behringer vd400 analog delay
maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit
it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin
the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates
the strings are well made and ive never had an issue with quality
remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor
they wear out extremely fast though
you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task
please please please please do research before you buy anything
the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast
its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie
its kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because its stiff
my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery
switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal
this saves so much time for getting strap on and off
installed easily in 3 different guitars so far
but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar
come with all cables needed
it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion
fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume
i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads
who says ernie ball cant make good acoustic strings
i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar
solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect
the price was the bestanywhereand with free shipping i couldnt be happier
its confusing and i do gain or filter in my daw
i saw some hybrids on amazon and had never heard of them
probably would be improved with a set of aguilas
ive never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion
the tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough
for quiet practice youre best getting a vox amplug imho
perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily
these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently
does not have good sound but hey
i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy
they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster
if youre purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
no noticeable hum at 34concert34 level
this model is a keeper to be sure
they bend but not easily
for the price i dont see how you can beat this pedal
you could say that requires two hands in order to remove it
or where ever you play
make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing
the only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life
if needed i would buy another
it takes some practice and patience
i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target
well worth the price of the product
i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value
in fact i dont hear any interference at all even with a single coil
you can spend hours finding 34your sound34 or just 34the sound34 that you need
even as i learn the notes on the guitar fretboard
since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand
from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance
i would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat
these are also sturdy and look very good
recently acquired an ovation mandolin which itself is hardly 34standard34 in appearance materials etc
easy to grip and as durable as most
this will b my 2nd one of these so to me its worth it
very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight
the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate
the design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on
no complaints with the crybaby
too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly
this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one
havent got to far into this thing yet but i do like it
if you receive a lemon return it and order another
i have a collection of straps but not a black one
i like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar
so dont buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use
i will update if any problems arise in time
nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp
this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years
theres not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing
btw i am a verified purchaser just cant say enough good about this cable
i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass
i have used many clipon guitar tuners
this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars
i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball 4037 black polypro strapinstead
and botique quality at paupers price
i ended up not needing it so
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use
it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying
seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it
go with it and get a set of these
im getting a few more
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
when i wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth
original reviewrecently i got the itch to try different unique picks
easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end
i cant expect miracles at that pricepoint but i certainly expected better
i got and agreethis works better
its a very solid fairly large item made of heavy cast metal
trim and easy to use
earnie balls guitar strap locks are great
but i discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds
if so then dont buy this sample pack
item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed
i was not disappointed at all
my guitar doesnt fall down anymore
the effects are better than id hoped for
every guitarist should have this
these strings do not last less time than the elixirs
the best i8217ve used so far
no complaints with this outfit
i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag
the bad monkey overdrive pedal does not produce crazy train metal distortion
i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn1
the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me
i used this with drums
the one i received was completely useless
good product at a good price
ive owned many effects over 32yrs playing
its a good banjo capo
on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone
would have received a 5star rating had it been in a metal enclosure
if you buy you wont be disappointed
thank you amazon  fender
fender is basically giving these things away
unless youre so amazing you can make it work every song
ive read some complaints about this unit
this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it
it comes with clips that can be used for other tablets
it seemed to work very well in this role
im using this with an ovation balladeer
i kind of wish id have bought that combo kit
if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam
they either use too much or too little
with that baby cranked i spent many happy hours in tone heaven
the neat freak in me hates that
this works much better in that regard
i love the colors and the matte finish too
over the strings it would slide below the nut which isnt good
perhaps a straight to straight would be better
this was for a friend who plays guitar
i decided to replace the saddle with this one
get a few rolls as a meter doesnt go as far as youd think
kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use
awesome value for the price
are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts
that said the pedal is great
now i have a lot more guitar for my money
good strings and not overly prone to corrosion
for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install
for 30 there is no reason not to try it
the capo was easy to pop out of the package
great recorder on so many levels
for being so cheap this pickup works surprisingly great
ive also got over a dozen capos dont ask
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
it does what it was made to do
i have a 5 watt combo amp
i love these little guitar stands
pretty simple it does what its supposed to do
i have another headstock tuner that ive had for awhile
just sounds flat and boring
it removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately
ill probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon
snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find
the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely
we use those widethreaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall
will work on any instrument
these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first
i love the design and the strap holds up very well
the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards
nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price
ive been using dunlop tortex picks for years with the
and the carrying case makes it very portable
downloading is quick and easy
i have a vox ac4tv
throw some strap locks on it and away you go
get it youll love it
dont buy the one from the store this is cheaper
i have no complaints about it
the fender and the deans were very nice
move the switch down to the low midscoop mode
it is also small and portable
this works very good on a silver flute
certainly do not get the rc 2
im crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last
good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly
this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good
super stable and doesnt take up much space
a couple tips to tuning a guitar  tune it like you play it
this box does the trick
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
also the price is right
so far it has worked beautifully
its a great little tuner
however the prices for these on amazon are absurd
overall this is an awesome product
this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well
blue tape both sides as to prevent marring
however youll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse
you may see it differently
if its past center the string is sharp
an integrated flip out kickstand would make this perfect
im very pleased with the product and the price
but atleast for me it does the job and does it well
quality is really outstanding for the price
very durable and gets the job done
once you get the hang of this capo its wonderful
i purchased it for that reason
just dont use this for guitars
not sure what else can be said about a capo
if its not good at least youre not out a lot of money
a simple device yet so useful
its built like a tank and its nice and solid
so this item is three tools in one
i do wish it could rotate both directions
the locks work great and give you an added sense of security
i plan to stick with them
they need to improve their quality control
its decent sound and decent build quality for a good price
since it died that first time it doesnt seem to perform the same
it hasnt seen heavy use
the tuning is excellent and so easy
each song have a chart on which chord you will use
he also likes the small size
i have many different makes of power supplies
highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar
i have a few planet waves products and i can safely recommend them
bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable
not sure yet on the new line
it makes my strings last longer
i eventually put back the original el84s and that didnt help
overally solid pedal as youd expect from boss
ive written a review before
brass tacks  is this the greatest mic in the world
they use the same chip
i am super impressed with this little thing
picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology
works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar
thats like the only downside i can think of
money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground
the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it
the response of the exps sounds very consistent to my ears
yes this is a great overdrive
give good crisp and live sound to my acoustic guitar
if you need some 6 cables to connect your pedals look no farther
it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap
designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job
it works perfect with cakewalk music creator 5 and a digitech vocalist
you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc
will and have used it since
quick to clip on and off
i think its better than the sovereign
a peghole reamer might have done a better job but i didnt have one
i am happy i bought this
why else would you be reading this
hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music
i had to send my first one back
like most nickel strings do
this one has a great display  full colour and easy to read
so if youre looking for a vocalpodcast mic this is a great cheap option
standard built like a tank boss construction is renowned for
take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean
a friend had and os2 on hand and let me use it
it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem
and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do
ive used hosa for years they have never let me down
no matter how i adjust it it has a muddy sound
this is just what it looks like  a very economical strap
way cheaper than i saw in guitar center
i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now
ill try the dava picks again later if i feel the need
its springloaded so it comes back up by itself
i have a 1918 chezch violin and its sparked my 11 year olds interest
sonically i found them to be the same  or to my ears anyway
elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my guitars
i really wanted this to be a great product
what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device
it gets thumbs up for the soundprice ratio
i use to use my sound card
6 this thing is heavy and rugged
the ultimate guitar cleaning tool i love love love this kit
but the elixir sounds  feels better
sturdy welldesigned and frets the strings well
this guy really had me believing in smallvibrationtuning
it should just take some getting used too
not the best not the worse strings but an improvement
apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception
i have a lovehate relationship with compressors
the bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut
its fairy thick and the material doesnt slip around on your shoulder easily
i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on
good locks i like them better then the dunlops
one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired
arrived early and is of great quality
my guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug
i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag
it is very well made
id say the effects are just soso
especially for the price range
i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker
that means you get one position
talk about a false sense of security
i definitely recommend trying out a set
i expected this to come with a dc adapter
these headphones get the job done
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools
what about the boss me70
this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components
martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow daddario just shines
i still pull one of these out every once in awhile
we custom manufacture insert cables for custom soundreinforcement fixed installations
no problems with slipping and tuning
and the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other
then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages ibooks etc
but i still have a 70 mic that wont work with my computer
on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for 360 to 380
this came in the mail today in a rather large box
and i have a ton
i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit
however compared to elixers the sound just isnt as 34full
this is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments
no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck
almost the same sound as the pyramids and a lot cheaper
of course none of this means i will stop buying od pedals
if it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick
i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless
good sound and the feel is good
it also looks great to talent in your studio
i will stay on with the exp16 right now
for that purpose these are made well
ive been using these strings for many years
i knocked it to 4 stars because they dont match up
these do it for me
thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best
comes with dual locking strap holes on each end
it works fine but its inconvenient
he would definitely purchase from here again
i am six feet tall
i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage
i have it as the last on my pedalboard before my gnx4
but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong
this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand
i immediately bought a 2nd set for my small hafler speakers
looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for
the fitment to the power supply is there
they are about halfsheet size
her reason for her opinion is simple
they dont feel as secure as the schaller locks
the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys
not your average giant clumsy guitar stand but it works
to your guitar amp or from it
the screen is also very bright and easy to read
i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner
its plastic thats 1 star deduction but in this case very pleased overall
there are better sounding strings yes
it must be from a product like this
i then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended
it has excellent bass and treble tuners
it is basic and not fancy
leaves board clean and fast
i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon
i love my levys jacquard straps
so slick and last forever compared to standard strings
i went with the mediums
for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these daddario strings
it is built solidly and looks roadworthy
all i can say is wow
this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is
it puts guitars into the best tune
very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong
they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics
on the positive action and intonation good
that huge box is then inside yet another huge box
great as a primary or backup cable
it kinda wobbles up and down
same with the sm 58es58
i bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project
this box is very well made and will last a long time
just find a stud and drill in the screws theyll hold just fine
chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out
sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play
easy to use and accurate
the two things i was looking for
always add those rubber gasket strap stops too
the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic
theres no breakin time required
being able to angle the unit is great
the samson is the more delicate and refined of the two
i also own bose quiet comfort 15s and ae2s and the grado s80is
in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact
pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments
ive been playing with this a lot since i got it last week
i consider this also to be a nonissue
it was absolutely worth the small investment for me
all seemed to function perfectly well
without those picks its just black molded flab
this strap is very comfortable
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others
i defiantly recommend them for everybody else
the mic imo is fullyvalued even at its singledigit price
i dont really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a 34ukulele34 setting
i ordered this one and he loves it
years ago i used the clayton 34small teardrop34 picks
i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp
good height adjustment for sitting or standing
easy to install strap locks
i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt30
these are a good value for quality strings
although the snowflake doesnt use a spring clip it suffers from the same limitation
nice bright screen perfect and the price is right
a must have for any folk player
i know this is a great product
fyi  parchment is slightly off white
i like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to
with not much left i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro
so many functions and just a great design
i have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all
this is a nice cable
very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar
buy a pack and try them out
as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in
my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item
the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls
divas will not use the red ball windscreen
i wonder how i ever lived without it before
it could be thicker  it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up
although the cloth i got was black and not yellow just pointing that out
i would definitely buy these strings again
there is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start
however ive purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less
i like many things about this tuner
all the hype and positive reviews you read are all true
i am able to see my music
works well for my guitar
whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true
switching to these 10s made a huge difference in tone
the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp
i still use this for practice at home
even the crunch button is just a louder sound
the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a lightmedium
the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze
it is light weight just the right size
this piece of plastic is just terrible
in those 7 years i havent broke a single string
sounds great on my sg and my acoustic
decided to try the dunlop
the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6
ive used these on the reg for a year
i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems
it is lightweight but is still sturdy
this acessorie is well builded and dont change the guitars pitch
the quality is obviously high
used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin
if youre really an acoustic guitar aficionado youll want to try these
lots of folks like them but not for me
it was defective in more than two areas
i dont even have that
they are even smoother and easier to play that i remembered them
the photo makes them look weaker than they are
setup is finished and i can now agree with most reviewers
take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy
sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems
this is not one of those
that tube is an excellent storage tube
high quality product and very easy to install
i cant really go back to normal sized picks now
they could have done better on that end
i originally purchased these strings because of the 1152 gauges
this is a nice leather mandolin strap
good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones
i used a different color cable for each function
i hope that doesnt happen with an adapter
but you can get them ultimately
they work no issues handy to have on hand
easy to use easy to see
they work like a charm
this fender mini guitar stand works great
something else that weighed into my purchase was durability
i always buy this brand
just dont ever drop it
enough grip to stay put in hands well too
i really should send this pos back to amazon
im using them with both acoustic and electric guitars
ive done it successfully for years
you cant blame a chicken for not quacking properly
the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched
this is an excellentsounding pickup
we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent
that being said using the looper was an eye opener
i dont think the cat would appreciate that
ive tried them all and i like the shubb the best
this capo comes with a pick holder
in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57
while it is very adjustable the intell folds flat which i really like
i replaced it with  mini modtone type delay
they turned out to be just right
i recommend this capo without reservation
this is a good quality capo
the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched
i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural
they have a high build quality and work great
theres also three switch positions  off on and fx
this guitar stand is as basic as you can get
then it had some stuck notes
my cpu is windows 7 but it worked on my msi netbook also
you can pay more and get less
anyway focusrite does which is one reason i trust them a little more
i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place
they have a very comfortable feel and great sound
i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts
7mm and thats just right
all these harmonicas in one case and they sound great
very satisfied with this one
exactly what i needed for testing guitars and playing at home
this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hardearned callouses soft
but i hope then would run on batteries next time
is all i can say
if you need it theres enough wiring to have space between your pedals
the dura picks have more variety theres only one in each thickness
i will have to fabricate some protection
the honeytone is aptly named
works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time
havent had to change tuning once they settled in
im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
well if you do you need strings
you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal
the switch is a click metal button similar to those used on mxr pedals
imo you cant go wrong with this tuner very pleased
they dont wear down as easily as delrin tortex or some other materials
its well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to
so i put these on my 1978 musicman stingray bass
25 whereas the same string in the exl111 set is
i also bought a lesson book for drums for myself
added 08nov2010  the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing
this is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich
and this guy did the job
yes because i usually have spares
for the money this thing sounds just fine
i highly recommend these tuners
the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings
red light always stays on and ive never seen the green light
i like the extra heavy picks
all a at reasonable prices
they fit in the factory hole without a problem
i tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards
its sturdy reliable and to the point
but you dont really need it that much anyways
i guess there was some mild crud buildup you cant see
this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality
not a finger print on it anywhere
i have recommended this stand to others also
the amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings fuzz twang etc
both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses
wished maybe they came in yellow
they make a strong connection between pedals and dont sacrifice any sound quality
good price and works well
either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost
these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with
i was surprised howsturdy it appears
i will be buying these again
you cant rely on the product description or packaging to answer that
but this will more than meet your needs to use at home
and it is not a toy
i recommend this mixer for your home studio
im not a switch whole patches on the fly guy
the attack heads that i bought though are single ply
i really love monster cables
we love having it around
a great purchase and built like a tank
the potential for damage here is very high
this is the pick i learned to play with
big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel
nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght
i have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic this being the second acoustic
and the build quality is solid
i have run both aroland rd300nx digital pianoandroland vcombo vr700
hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though
well it fits but just barely
ill use nothing but snarks
i recommend this to anyone who records at home
besides that the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic
this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever
cons its too heavy for my mic stands
it would keep me from buying another one of these
my c5ce washburn has been a very good purchase
i put these on an epiphone les paul acousticelectric and it sounds so great
i have four snarks and one other brand
schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap
exceeded my expectations on quality and price
i dont use auto gain
it replaced my roland boss tu12h
i find myself wishing i had ordered more
you can do a search there and hear what it is capable of
this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured
ive purchased many snark tuners
but thats sort of what youre getting
after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin
i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk5 drum mic packagefor details
but as a platform for greatsounding mods you cant go wrong
these would probably better suited to guitarists
fits nice and provides good protection
i just finished putting them up and im completely satisfied with their solid construction
great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp
makes rotosound strings really sound off
i adore the sound and the reliability
used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr
this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out
i just learned last night how to coil them up
this pick holder works for me
this is a very good and stable stand
the strings came very quickly and are of very good quality
this mixer has great audio
mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use
i may try those next time on my les paul
it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase
no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min
now i power all my pedals with one power supply
then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on
i guess thats because they are cheap
even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew
more than enough decay and wetness
i cant see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all
not at all what i expected for the money
seams strong  seams like it will last
8020 strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar
its a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well
now get out thereand play your heart out
this daddario micro ns tuner tops all those with ease
it performs as it should and appears to be quite durable
this mixer handles it all perfectly
this is a decent pop filter
with one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have
overall good strings and ill probably buy them again
watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok
fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff
anyway besides that they seem to be decent enough quality
if you dont mind the heft you will be pleased
do it have a decent quality sound
these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness
it should work very well with any size acoustic guitar
put this through an ac30c2 and prepare to be amazed
again light went out and back to the original
nope no flaws noticeable to me
one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these
if youre considering buying this just do it
i do recommend some snap locks for it though
i did not  expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitar
when they say mini they mean it
one other thing that i had in mind so ill say it here
theres no substitute for the right part
feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever
the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder
over all i would not recommend this product
so its a give and take issue
i returned this because i wanted the script version instead
i will keep this short
sturdy material nice draw string to close it up
of all of them i especially like lopera jade
i hope if yall get one
it works different than an eq
it works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar
i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago
042or save some money and go withdaddario exl120 electric guitar strings super light 942
never really had to mess much with this item
storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks
i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings
understandable as it was made and shipped from indonesia
i bought this microphone for youtubepodcasting and it does a really perfect job
after a little break in these brought some new life back into my amp
note   this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack
i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit
i tried it and the light wouldnt even come on indicating usb
nice and loud in a small package
this is a great pick
alot of zoom h1 users put this over their mics
these have the sweetest tone for batterybased abuse
does it get the job done
theyre also awesome for live recording use as a monitor
great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great
i do not know anything about guitar
actually its loud enoucht for home
this needs to be plugged directly into a computer
switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck
remember this amp is not for metal
but they really dont do all that great a job
it does what its supposed to that other capos dont do
it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder  adapter
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
i believe its zinc alloy but thats fenders fault
mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue
i will try to get a replacement
the finish on this product is very nice
the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards thats well known
what a racket it is
i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong
id definitely recommend this product to a friend
it gives wonderful string balance and sustain
i use it with my fender mustang
if you really want a capo get a keyser or other decent capo
very well made with good padding
with the snark any of them
received them in four days
somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain
the base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it
not sure what else you could want out of it
when it comes to noise gates this definitely does the trick
i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues
im very happy with this purchase
but the adjustable clamp is really
amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive
these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles
it stays in tune and dont let the laminated top scare you its great
the sound quality complaints are no joke
the build quality is outstanding and its true bypass
great for vocals and guitar
i love waxing my guitars
dont drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime
i like snarks and think they are some of the best clipon tuners
a im very impress with the precition of this tuner
cables are working really well for me
ill look silly if it lets me stay in tune
wonderful price and great product
it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product
the applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified
the jp02 frees me up from any other wall warts
for the money its a crazy deal
i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect
ill take ernies over martins but not over daddarios on my guitars though
no issues with the screw not tightening either
this capo isnt quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar
the guitar came in great shape
bass only  take it or leave it
i kinda demands output to another devicemixeramp if you want to play loud
at least thats what she told the police
these flatwounds were a perfect choice
im not kidding  it was one of those finds
just in conclusion theres basically nothing this amp cant do at least fairly well
it works as expected and has not given me any problems
works as advertised for my purpose
for 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion
and for the fact it was cheaper than most
lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound
what more can a guy say about a little box of screws
the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation
i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs
i always go with elixirs
very glad i bought the  planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter
it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that
the tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones i can find
qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins
i certainly have no complaints
these strings feel great and sound fantastic
they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are
it does do what is supposed to do
for 2400 this compressor does just what its supposed to do
this is a great music stand
i havent noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about with these cables
for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height
in fact its beautiful and totally functional
i did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size
ive had this set for about a month and a half
when in the studio this is where the pedal shines
for 50 im very impressed
i will buy one of these again
not sure what other than complete failure would take stars away
if had to do over again id pass
i had them on my yamaha fg700s
immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away
wow yes that is it
but why not use the best when i can
very disappointed in built quality
i am not calling him or her out or anything
case in point  pure nickel strings
the dials and everything was easy to understand
presets tap tempo and a nice feature set
it might work in a busker situation
ill update this review if anything happens
in this case you can look forward to getting a great product here
it also holds my water bottle with no problem
im a 62 yo newby to guitar
i use this clamped to a table and its a superb product
this is the best at combining two tools into one
this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal
the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck
good quality for my casual use
this little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size
youd be silly not to bite on that right
good thing i had purchased the 9volt power adapter
i wear a large sized glove so assuming that would translate i got these
altogether im very satisfied with this tuner
i am very pleased with this music stand
this was exactly what i needed and worked out great
especially if you use tubes
works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect
pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price
with a bit of tweaking is fine for studio work
i hope this helpsjps  the currency is in us dollars
solid well built and should last
came in time worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic
the sound quality is amazing and its very easy to use
the sound is great and it is easy to play
quality sounding and durable for a great price
i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great
ive never used strings that bend so well
good value and good function
if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley 4 knob
this is a great bargain too since its certainly not an expensive accessory
ive watched friends  bandmates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps
the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play
fast delivery and a good price
theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedals
the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar
so add 10 to get more than 30 minute in tune play here
if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy
it works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal
you will only get a muddy garbled mess
this interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint
i am extremely pleased with this amp
very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth
i own a number of guitar hangers
the strap had a small stain
did the job for what i needed
it came with entry level strings
be careful when you hang it though
bone does make a considerable difference i have found
overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs
feels good to switch positions solid and quiet
i purchased four and they were all delivered on time
some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdmausbinf
its not going to unlock on you
an inexpensive but nice set
i always say half of video is audio
this thing has so many uses its ridiculous
it picks up every smudge smear  print and leaves nothing behind
i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recordingproducing
again the us100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities
i am about 59 and a trim 155 lbs
i have run into the 90 deg
every note will have the same volume
ive had this for 4 days and so far its still working perfectly
this is a nice leather strap not thick but very functional and nice looking
i thought it wouldve lasted a little longer
the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport
if i plug the us100 back in the settings revert again  very reliable
these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets
i use these on my acoustic washburn and they stay bright for weeks
shipping was fast and no problems
my hunch is that a good powered 4port hub would be equally effective
it was the strings and im very glad i replaced them with these strings
this stand does the trick
i love these picks and the
but i love the gated reverb feature among all modes
very nice protection for my luna
fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability
100 e they have a
but there was one thing wrong
i bought epiphone cases for all of them
this seemed to be the best choice for me
if you have a padded leather strap i dont recommend these
get a snark and you will be happy
the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tinlike
either they feel good in your hand or they dont
i have been playing guitar since i was 14 years old
these little tuners are amazing
bought the focusrite unit instead
in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection
the best replacement for fender tuners by far
note  we have the burgundy color one
simply fantastic piece of equipment
the uke is a solid little guy
i think this patch looks cool on the bass
once you try these picks you never go back
in case one wasnt good enough they double it up
this little tuner does the job
not high quality but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks
its cheap and it works as advertised
also the clamp works well
i just put this on my dot hollowbody
i only play elixir strings
my connections were on and off i thought i had a dead pedal
my sons mom thought it was a toy 34its so small
they screw in and hold things
i play mostly blues and classic rock
this thing is like a magic spray
they are always good quality
otherwise its well built and works
it is built very well with long lasting parts
i ordered a couple from my guitar seller
but still 2x the cost of the jimi
i have two of them
it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned
easy to use easy to read and has options that i dont even use
sounds good with both guitars  especially neck and center positions
i thought id try these out and i loved them
if i wanted it on there tho its got a peel off sticky back
my fret board looks so good to
what more do you need
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
this was my first shoulder rack and i didnt know what to expect
given 5 stars shipped on time and at good price
cables are good my only complaint is the connectors
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
upon comparing the resulting  cds
its definitely flat and natural sounding which i like
instead it produces a warm oldtime overdriven tone
rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7
i have other tuners but this one is the best
the top portion that rests on a table surface is about 14 inch think
and another comment in 2013
the e and b strings never have enough coating but still
not the best but not the worst
but you need to rehearse
this thing is a little jewel
i also use it to tune my violin and it works great
i dont often use picks but when i do i use these
well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions
wider than a 6 string but not much
i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp
overall pretty good and very simple to operate
i didnt need the fx
in 40 years i have had every kind of capo out there
i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices
because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5
virtually every genre is represented here
it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings
idk why gc does not carry these
they are getting very very close to tube sound
this tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument
anyone who works with pa and sound equipment needs these adapters
brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking
it doesnt sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine
they worked fine at a great price
although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction
ive never been disappointed by the quality
this is a fantastic product if you understand its limitations
made of durable nylon with pick pocket
small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practicesrehearses etc
its got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust
this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments
as for leveling it seemed ok
i had some noise even at moderate volumes
the springs are almost always missing
its also the cheapest one i ever bought
youll still have a nice cord you can use on any mic
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a 341 spot34 brand plug
trustable quiet good materials durable etc
im gonna try to heat these so i can stretch them a bit
it also comes with a nice polishing cloth
a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power
but if you want something that is 90 close well this is it
fantastic product that every guitar player needs  period
a single dot of superglue fixed that
construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis
dont forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder
well it fits the rode m1 mic i was using nice and tight
it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones
they are good to go
oh that reminds me the casing is plastic
its exactly what you would expect from behringer it works
the product works perfectly and is durable
my first 2 units have a very bright blue ish color led for power
if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain
when done simply tap again and the led goes to green and plays back
i am very pleased with the product
nice to see something well made for a change
the best way to describe this stand
the construction is pretty good
i like the build and design
schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players
lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp
why do i like this bag better
i like fender mediums always have but i gotta branch out man
it was only one and it was red
they do look particularly good plugged into a marshall half stack
adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument
its getting easier with these
they last for months without a change in tone
much better than plastic ones especially if you stay in the light thickens
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
there are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators metronomes etc
i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price
what more can you ask from a tuner of this price
hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone
this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance
a little story to back these locks integrity
this looks to be well built and should be reliable
i have them in chrome in every guitar i own
they last a long time and my fingers dont hurt when i play
then come the newbiesa few models from mxl etc etc
it sounded brilliant while it wasnt broken for about the 4 hours of runtime
i needed picks so i ordered an assortment
its not rocket science to make them work
a good cable for the money
cable would be ok if the end connections would stay screwed together
this little box is great for metronome use
i would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel
it really has its own tone i must add
first off the shipping was fantastic
so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet
they work and are fender parts
these dunlop straploks are amazing
i like fender bullets on it
ill always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board
id think its was a cheap knockoff childs guitar
that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing
the unit is extremely small but dont let that fool you
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
i guess out of sight out of mind
this is totally unnecessary for a footswitch
make sure you order the right size
the reason i bought this one was because it was cheap
these slow me down way to much
but for me they are still tops
daddario is my favorite string hands down after almost 40 years of playing
i know that pick choosing is a personal matter
will but another one if any of them die great product
glad i got this one
just to make sure you have the proper humidity level
for the price this is a pretty nice strap
i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal
effects  there are 9 amp models ie 57 deluxe metal 2000 etc
it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear
but i havent dented anything yet so perhaps im just too skeptical
no guitar effects or drum patterns like bosss br micro 4 and 80
very nice guitar picks for the very fair price
it serves up great tones into either one
it uses one cr2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included
they are certainly worth the price
so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again
i have used it for years
it compares itself to the ts right on the box and for good reason
but they just keep making them
this pedal is tubescreameresque but not as midrangeheavy as a ts
it has little geckolike protrusions that grip the e string
the second issue is actually a very concerning to me
this strap is very well made
wet means more of the effect and dry means less
606060 be warned this review may not help you
very useful for connecting rack components between
not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are
the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive
so not much selection there
they are large and  well  plastic
it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions
almost time to order another set
lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound
and for the price this is a solid 4 star amp
i needed 220v power overseas and so i ordered this
however the bag was ripped in 3 places
the sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next
if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out
our teenager really likes these
i have yet to try them with my microphone
rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the daddario flatwound
i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain
there are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings
for the price this stand just cant be bet
this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs
yes this guitar has an oiled finish
some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has
he is thrilled with this guitar
i have always had trouble holding onto picks
it does not vary the pitch
its incredibly easy to use and very handy when restringing a guitar
with intensity below 50 it was usable
at least thats what it says on his website
bought several of these and they worked fine
this guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble
it also helped my boyfriend decide also
they are all awesome in thier own way
used this foot pedal for a and so far ive had know problems
because they are led the batteries last a long time
for the price its amazing
until i crank the dial over and shred some faces
i usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session
tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay
i like dunlop products but
this seems to be a nice rugged stand
it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either
but thats way too much amp for me at this time
i received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar
im not sure about a transistor amp
three things for the benefit of other newbs  1
in the tonal category these strings fell short
i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on
all of my guitars are strung with daddario 10s
there is some noise but i dont attribute that just to the power supply
no problems with distortion or noise
the title says it all
what could possibly go wrong
i swear by these strings
it is similar to skb and fits my guitar very nicely
it is still a good dealtoday  if you can find one used
for such a small combo this amp really packs a punch
its solid and works well
they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups
keeps my case at a nice 6070 humidity
this arrived a week sooner then expected
thats the sound ive been looking for out of this amp
my guitar is safe now with this hard case
much better than standard industrial strength velcro
with these flats the sound is gone
i was sure glad that i ordered this cable as a backup
i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic
the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts
no scratches or anything on my taylor
so what is the difference between the 235 and the 535
i have big hands which may be part of it
will buy this brand again
kind of a gross plastic smell
could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os 106
the included ableton live 8 lite software recognized the unit as well
no fuss no muss no fooling around
i hate their new packaging
lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors
does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar
it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less
i havent regretted the purchase
fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage
and if it doesnt so what
very durable and not uncomfortable either
just got this in this week
very lush and sweet to listen too
it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board
this is my guitar pick of choice
the cable is good and normal
have been very happy with them
you wont be let down
so i ended up using it to hang my rock band guitar
ive been using this polish since the early 80s
this of course doesnt have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing
just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced
they didnt solve any problems or make anything better
the planet waves capo definitely gives the kyser a run for its money
youd best be served with dot stickers
for the price of these strings you cant go wrong
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
as i said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen
this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair
love the price and they shipped quickly
basically the value of your guitar andor the age
tonesound quality  the sound quality of this effect is outstanding
i would definitely recommend it to a friend
the truth is they will work on anything
sure the od is there but it isnt worth losing your tone is it
you cant go wrong with any snark
i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation
well long story short this is my fourth vox wah
its a great cable for the price
if you can afford it the peterson is the best clipon tuner out there
i bought i thought it was cool and different
padded so does not scratch finish on neck
now i know i would love a better one like a fishman
amazing lowend output for such a small cab
i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to redo the board
it really is a great product
high quality and great sound
009 string or 1st string was not in there
the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f47 rc guitar
the base of this bone nut does not have a radius
i am not an expert on guitar strings
it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amplike
my favorite brand of strings right now
bought verbzilla digitech rv7 and the verbzillas ripoff   behringer rv600
very easy to hit the wrong one
should last a few months at least
built well its casing is made out of metal not plastic
it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it
very happy with this item
i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed
i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player
i first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks
perfect for my home studio holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard
not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions
and how it goes out of tune fast
it does what it says it does
if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software
after three days the battery goes out
they work great were easy to assemble and not expensive
i highly recommend these for around the house use
it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target
i have used these picks for years now and i just love them
he loves to play his bass and sing along
this one fits the bill
rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain
btw  12axt and ecc83 are the same tube
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
the photo cannot do it justice
i finally concluded that there was no difference
even came with a couple of velcro straps
what to do with it
base is heavy and sturdy so your mics wont topple over
however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems
these are my favorite strings for electric guitar
the chorus effect is a little weak
it has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister
incidentally this pedal like any other digital delay or digital reverb will eat batteries
these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well
luv it i had version 1 and this amp isnt much different
this strap is perfect for those needs
this is a great little tuner for guitar
i would look elswhere for a different product
like noticable and just horrible
im not especially particular but do like good sound
fwiw i like my snarks better
i change strings quite often so it really doesnt matter
i wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that
and works well for it
money very well spent and highly recommended
just what the guitar doctor ordered
i8217m really glad i did
they translate better with the correction curve active
these kind of clips can break
not too hard not too soft
the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence
not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string
well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around
ive tried others   always go back to ernie balls
filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup
this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for
i bought three and am purchasing 3 more
works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch
these mediums work well for playing electric guitar
let me start of by saying this tuner is great
overall great entry level interfacesound card
and it puts the name 34martin34 on the lowliest box guitar
edit  apparently this thing fluctuates between 2030
tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want
i have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables
i figured i had nothing to lose
i love these picks for playing my acoustic
great idea in different colors
i am now on my second set of strings and i am hooked
it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid
that frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff
it can do anything and sound any way you want it too
well i hated each other one i tried
modified is more scooped saturated
i would purchase this unit again and again
it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident
this is my second 4 way switch and it wont be the last
my seagull now sound mellow with brightness
the only weak point is the somewhat thin mid cut toggle switch
it was time to replace all with frest strings
the next day the guitar neck looked and played great
no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing
nice tone last a decent amount of time and theyre cheap
what can i say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal
i have been a gigging musician for over 20 years
but low quality is low quality
you can tell when theyve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling
so youll need to decide what songs they work for etc
for the ts pedals in this price range its the most useful
it worked with my windows 7 starter acer netbook
also i like the first day of new strings look shiny
rich but not too over powering
the neck has to be thinner though
for the money this mic performs very well
the tripod base has been very steady so far
the flex is just right for me and they last forever
this is intended to replace a mim 6 screw stratocaster bridge
obviously any small bump into the stand will once again set this off
i didnt need no adaptation to install it on guitar
i bought him a set of these
dont worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound
yes you really replace your strings very fast with this winder
i would have no issue gigging with this unit
for a comparison mic i used an akg perception 420
if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts
far better than any light weight chrome stand this has guts
at this price how can you go wrong
both ended up in checked luggage
as usual an excellent zoom product
probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide
they look good and the paint lasts great for a performance space
hard to beat it as far as leather straps go
i always keep a lot of these on hand
the possibilities are limited only to your imagination
should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord
works greatgreat little tuneri would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner
happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to
ive used this live since i got it and it works great no problems
from patch cables to guitar cables i simply trust this company
well worth it for the price
i own a red blue and now a black one
when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill
i just wish i had found this guitar sooner
love my assortment of picks and the price was right
if you like acdc you would like this
these are great picks and yes they are slippery
there really is nothing not to like about this pedal
quality of manufacture and assembly great
ive been using the daddario strings for about 10 years now
a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it
no problems with it at all
excellence once again from tc
read the other reviews this is a really nice value
over all i think daddario is great for warm balance tones
31014 edit  looper control is flawed
you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen
it is exactly what i was hoping it would be
at 2000 this amp is a deal
besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe
if you want great strings get fender strings
this stand does the trick beautifully
they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country
if you need a longer cable buy a longer cable
once installed you are good for life
it holds your guitar up
i taught her the cchord and i play the gchord
so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that
one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair
dont worry about the 34thing34 hanging inbetween your strings
yes the housing is made of plastic
nice case but doesnt provide the protection that i need for my guitars
but when i grabbed this pedal i was blown away
bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from
its like having a loose connection inside the cable
it could be less dense i think
i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty
the local shop only charged me 5 to shave them down
in fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set
versus the godlyke id say this is the better purchase
then to my surprise the squier strat was delivered yesterday
its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy
so far the so good used for almost a month now
ive used these elixir strings for years and i would never change
the item came quickly and as decribed
the sound is great and is easy on the fingers
09s to try on my strat and the
the angle does the job
the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it
its a nice thick cable
this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length
this product is not what it seems
but over all this amp is a most welcome deal
i figured she pretty much got what she paid for
the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find
easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft
and it matches my tweed amp
this is my second order of the 10 pack
if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub
it doesnt have that 34cheap34 feel about it
anyway it doesnt seem much more then a normal gig bag
they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product
this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system
this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned
colors are abit too flashy
so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing
from blues to hard rock  metal
if the puppy murders this one ill order up another one just like this
does not sound good with updated equipment line 6 equipment roland units
these are really cheap strings but how they sound
the coversion cable didnt work
they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal
it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface
been buying them ever since and love them
15 days later it finally arrived
i love this microphone stand
cant always get what you want
onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things
this custom gauge set plays great
the amp has light sound and not much control
i thought the size of an altoid tin
but always come back to this one
you have to try it to believe it
but im not certain these last so much longer
great upgrade for squier telecasters
i have to say it is spectacular
id recommend to save some money and buy something above 200
dont hesitate to get one
this is a great little ukulele to have around the house
i am using on a yamaha board
just play one acdc riff into the 70s amp and youll recognize the sound
thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try
this has been commented on before
real good variation from full out rat like to not so much saturation
i purchased this pedal with good expectations
these are very clear and fine tuned
the lil suckers are all about tuning  stability
probably one of the reasons its so affordable
my gear used for testing  fender american deluxe stratocaster
i ordered one the next day
it was not what i wanted
martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar
so just make sure you get the right one
i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite
the work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple
i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model
first real harmonica i have owned
it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case
a couple of bucks more than dunlop
you wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick
the pedal itself is built like a rock
just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical
ive been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30 years
however they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use
occassionally there are problems with this set up
couldnt ask for more in a momentary switch
another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power
one star only for this product
mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones
super tight and very accurate
for home and garage entertainment is good enough
he was very happy with his gift
the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much
works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks
not bla bla bla this joyo pedals are the best any you get
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
everything is tweakable assignable and flexible
actually it was really easy to install
i honestly didnt notice anything different
easy to understand with responsive controls
recently i switched from a blackstar ht5 to a fender mustang iii v2 amp
the goods are up to scratch and fit properly
i looked at all the wires inside and they look ok
cant go wrong for the price
but for the price this is one hell of a deal
i just move it around the house wherever i feel like playing
it does it job very well
and nothing happened to it or the guitar
the speeds are from 40208 bpm
the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product
this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves
all youll need to get your pedal train wired and running
i tossed it aside and bought a fender gigbag
its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way
it sounds great with little of its own noise
when the unit first arrived i was concerned because the box had been damaged
very comfortable in the hand
these are a musthave item
the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes
from experience it never hurts to have extra picks around
i have not noticed any sound degradation from using it
no matter for me since all i use is the tuner anyway
the capo is pretty good
id suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions
so i worked on my technique some more
i shouldve bought this to replace the original switch from the start
8 guitars now are fitted
not sure how well it holds a tenor since i dont have one
i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on
again its very good at what it does if you dont power the microphone
the strings that come with it work fine and none snapped
the last string winder you will ever buy
consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand
i needed light without the heat
they always provide vibrant tonal quality
the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be
just a note of caution though
but recently my life changed a little bit
otherwise  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap
with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever
but locking tuners are not really for that purpose
says so right in the manual
the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display
i repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikes
it also has a 14 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well
they are solid secure and they look great
well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations
great for a beginner electric
i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s
im so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool
the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks
first it did not appear that anything was coming out
the snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat
otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of frail and bedazzled
the nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference
i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area
this is what i have been looking for for my accoustic guitar
he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there
my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications
the output latency was a tiny 43 ms only
they seem to get bad marks now and then
works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle
the topend professional compressors keeley pedals rack units etc
no trouble stringing or tuning either set
id say its a little expensive
for the price and intent i almost gave it 5 stars
its pretty fast and accurate for its price
ill do this to my other acoustics as time goes on
since i first got it ive rearranged once already
it nails those sounds well
ive owned this mic for 2 years if youre curious about durability
you click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop
please refer to my review of cakewalk music creator 6 here on amazoncom
the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism
small light and stays out of the way  it just works
this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing
whereas this does the job
buy it and you will see
its made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great
perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms
make sure you dont buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead
padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion
my only complaint about this guitar is that i didnt buy it sooner
it does exactly what is expected of it
this is a cheaply built cable
i used this product and it really soaked it up fast
the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options
this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster
hell even my cats cant do that and theyre porcelain
its a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful
so expect it to be a different color than what you order
if you havent tried em theyre worth a shot
pretty precise meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy
so i decided to get a set of strap locks
on my wifes a style mandolin it fits but barely
i was really surprised by this
overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended
this product has a monomicrophone input and a stereo headphone output
no further action is necessary
elixir is a wonderful company
dont hope to take chords on it
if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while
my uke is very cozy inside
a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try
these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings
ive been using them for years and they work amazingly
the ditto is great for practice though
this one works fine so far
right now i am just writing to get the required words out
but find myself using this even more often
it only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy
its not the best strap in the world but its not bad
these can take it and come back for more
arrived fast had them up and running in minutes
the product arrived within 23 days i couldnt believe how fast it got here
i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one
its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more
well worth the money spent
these are what i use on a regular basis
once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different
ive paid a lot more for a lot less
easy on and off and stays put
but then i tried this
running straight from the mixer outputs to the h4n works perfectly
hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation while lowering our labor costs
this one is the best yet
obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad
the cutter snips the strings with no effort
it never sounds 34thumpy34 or unnatural  but always musical
amazingly it is made in canada not china
he found just what he needed and at a great price
then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag
for the money you cant beat this cable
every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers
i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin
they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while
there is no need for proprietary or expensive strap locks
crisp and fresh tone for a long time
i immediately noticed a difference in the quality fullness and volume of my amp
this pick is so good to play electric guitar
my buddy likes the case so i am happy
i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day
frets were smooth rounded and played nice
these deliver on both counts
i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings
and daddario never produces junk
god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified
the capo is solid on the neck
i play harp with some some that i perform
they have great sustain and sound nice and chunky
please dont listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldnt keep tune
its an amazing tool for keyboard player
its not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives
great little controller for your daw or whatever
solid state just isnt the same
but once open they stand up well
have had tons of compliments on the sound
these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality
im amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs
if youre looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model
two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability
at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds
wellllllllllll just give it a try
operates with one 3v 2032 battery included
best of all warranty for life
im happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas
i began reading online about muffled audio on windows 7 pcs
i like it a lot
it was made for the military
i thought this pedal would do the trick
i am sorry to say that i returned it
i would have much preferred a device that has a twoposition switch
not bad for the price they have it for
much better than trying to rolloff the volume
grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack
my bass is an sx jazz bass
i like my phat strap just fine
some strings sound dull right out of the package
i bought it to keep my fender strat in and it works great
with a little sanding this fit my fender american strat perfectly
good product for a good price very comfortable
the pick holder work as described
it changed the whole way i play now
you can not go wrong with daddario strings
ive been using ableton for 4 years and it never crashes
overall i give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars
thanks to amazon for offering such a good product
my guitar had an 11hole pickguard
it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp
ive never had these before until recently
i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service
the pics also shed easily making your instrument dusty in no time
great strap durable and good lookin
it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar
so i sent it back
this seems like a nice high quality cable
just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly
i also really like the daddario pures
you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger
its working great but it does not work in stereo
excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal
fresh strings do sound better
the tone it gives isnt bad either
the 12pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity
windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately
but they said they love it
i love mine  so do my friends
you can run any number of power sources to it
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive
both stands showed up in good and working condition
perfect retrofit for my 1989 american strat
the locking mechanism is strong
go with the planet waves lock straps
i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action
i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box
if yore looking for a new strap i highly recommend this one
the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep
it is holding a shure sm57 microphone
notes are pretty mixed up and not separatedclear very loud though
this is my second fender polish cloth
problaly exist betters pedals but its produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything
im a blues guitarist so they take a beating well
whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way
the only problem i had is voltage
think i ordered it twice
i have nothing to compare these too except my lee oskar
all their cords are quit and are quality produces
it works for what i need
my old mic just wasnt cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface
i just wish it had a little more 34give34 to it
ive used boutique strings for many years but always come back to these
the effect is there then its not
the construction itself is ok
ive bought these daddario strings a few times because they are a great deal
so far it is working well for me
i use this on my takamine and my tele
i thought i had chosen a different capo
i figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze
they sute my needs just right for the takamine acoustic
if you buy 34items sold from amazon34 you can depend on free shipping
the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good
i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way
i use to protect my microphones
you cant honestly ask for more
intermittent issue indication  this is what made me choose this model
im giving 5 stars because daddario makes great strings
nice texture and it doesnt affect the sound of my mics
49 for a 199 microphone at amazon
never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers
included with the interface is a 5 foot usb printer style cable
my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks
in addition to all the other fx too
at the price it sells for i consider it a bargain
i dont own a strat so i cant comment on single coils through it
i wish it had a power button
i liked it so much i bought a second
theyre functional durable and can be setup within just a few seconds
i have a yamaha f335bl and a hohner hc06
on my electrics i love extra light 8 gauge strings
the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins
so its kind of like double trouble
purchased for my epiphone electric guitar
for the fender stat it works just great
i bought this not knowing what to expect
for my needs this one works
they arent bone brass wood pearl dont expect them to be
i think they are worth the premium price
push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep
this mini telescoping boom is the bomb
anyhow i digress but for a reason
if it can tune that it should handle your guitar or bass fine
easy to install and works like a charm
its relatively inexpensive small and light weight
and in that regard these are excellent strings
roland fender line6 and others still have that niche dialed in
just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq
it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously
ive use it for years
however chilling them did work well enough
i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats
switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot
on this guitar they sound a bit too bright
i ordered two of these stands and they work very well
and no surprises works like a champ
this brings us to the 4th and most expensive zoom the h4n
this is my second one for my other guitar
however it doesnt even show up in the product picture on amazon
well obviously that depends on the strap
they stil play great sound great against steel strings and last a long time
anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad
another reason why i love this is its noise free
after that the guitar was splendid
when you remove the strap any picks in the pocket fall out
these strings from daddario are a personal favorite of mine
5 stars because of the price and what i was expecting to get
but it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all
this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it
the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from
only thing is that it is big
and you will need a longer usb cord
the sound is a little too electronic for me
i will purchase again for my next build
the locking diecast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure
the tailpiece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing
the design is such that they will wear well
i love the open feel from these picks
did i mention this sucker is big
overall extremely happy with this purchase
90 degree trs is a nice touch
solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly
anyway i have had this tuner for a few years now
i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole
the autoclose function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger
compared these all in medium
there are much better ones on the market
just got this today and im experiencing serious install issues
all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist
this is a modeling amp
i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick
both my hot rod deluxe and blues deville came with foot switches
i go around to different venues and sing
as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired
you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model
definitely not the strings though
i recommend this if youre in the market for one
this is true for either one of the models
this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon
they are still supple and easy to wind up
my only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold
i have used these strings since they first came out
long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate
i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations
some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly
go and buy the dunlop nylon
if it lies flat then so is the fingerboard
not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still
i got it for me and my dad
buy it if you need a wall wart
these tend to last me about 3 months
with this new capo i am happy to use it
i love metal rock classic rock etc
almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials
oh and tight strap button holes
every microphone has it uses
these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are
i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great
this is a great value
as you can tell by the title ive got another of these little babies
im possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20 years
the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch
they last a long time if you wipe down after use
had mine for 2 years now and no complaints still as good as new
this thing has phantom power just in case you didnt read that already
this one is very thick and solid like its supposed to be
powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc
the last two of these that i have owned met untimely deaths
this is everything you need in a record brush
lighter than a full boom
i think so as well but i cant quite quantify it
in short   its a winner
i use this for working on my guitars mainly
very little instructions at all actually
bright easy to read display
you take the packs and put them in the sleeves
96mm or prs 10 picks
this saved med at least 40 instead of getting a traditional preamp
this mic is well made heavy on the micend
im not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagonwheel
they also dont distort out side sound
a quick word about behringer stuff
heavy if thats what your looking for
its also a noisy pedal
summaryacoustic sounds 34ok34 but noisy in weird ways
i used to buy all shure productsim switching to gls
the price is so low you should own at least one
they play well and last reasonably well
i have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons
nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick but its not for me
im a daddario man myself but hey free is free
they offer good middle of the road accessories
the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily
im using it for so many things including a music player for my truck
its very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer
a new batterry lasted me almost two years
this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratchproof stance
it presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack
still i needed a distortion that could cover of the marshall soundlike roar jcm800
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them
cant say much more than the description
some sheetsstand units cost 50
the strings didnt sound betteer or brighter
i dont want anything else
i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week
he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar
im very happy i bought them
these strings are as advertised
it plays well and the sound
the build seems very good
sound nice but very unreliable bx5a deluxe
who knows maybe theyll wear in and improve
if you fingerpick this is your amp
i can trust that i will be in tune
so yeah best of luck with that
i am totally satisfied with the stand
i am glad i bought this
my friend hated that part too and i agree with her
i opted for the 300 and got it for 25
i usually only have to change my strings once a month
everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing packageing and shipping
i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap
you cant go wrong with these guys
not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic
also this thing is huge for the back of the neck
best 3 ive ever spent
it makes you not easy to put back the mics
there is no added hiss hum or distortion
ive had a set before
also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys
the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more
it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments
i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar
i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line
it gets in the way and is hard to stay stretched out
deep storage pocket and more
i have 7 of these bad boy tuners and i love them
it was way too short for my seagull s12 coastline
i wont be buying these again
the action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up
like the black and it holds well
most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned
if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing
it tuned up very easily and for me it holds tune nicely
by far the most versatile pedal i have ever used
even the other players checked it out
the design of this product is innovative and excellent
but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too
its way better built than other pedals in this price range
they are definitely more comfortable
haha it made me laugh
id be happy using this on a welltraveled pedalboard
this thing is fun to play with
what you see is what you get
this is a super bag
the protector needs to be longer
snare kick and so on
specifically it has an output impedance of 50 ohms
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls
these original bullets are great for my strat
these are outstanding strings with great durability playability and exceptional sound
youll need to buy an xlr cable on your own
this is an excellent strap
i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky
this 2nd one im using to hang up my beats pros
easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings
it is heavy which i knew going in
i searched on amazon for a banjo strap and this came up
i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program
it still works but thats a design flaw
i also got black knobs as well
mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
cut the strings like they was made of paper
very easy to take it off holds the strings tight
but i do feel confident in what i report here
theres lots of gain available
i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness
it just didnt provide any plus at all anywhere else
mesa minirectifier amplifier mesa rectifier 2x12 cabinet with celestion v30s
this stand is very stable and useful
this pick holder is awesome
perfect for its intended use
sounds amazing in any combo
for this price you cant beat the item
for something but not a guitar
ive been thoroughly impressed with this pedal
while i wish the bases came in different colors i really like these hangars
i told them mine was 20
i dont like it hanging in my guitar
they clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced
would the adhesive dry out on this and 2
this stand does its job quite well
this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail
you should listen to both to know which is right for you
to my ears its not in the same spot on all presets
are you kidding me at this low price
it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob
then i recheck with my other brand and its not even close
i got this to use with my 12 string
theyre better in a thicker size 10mm or larger but the
this product worked very well for my needs
i think it would wear quickly with lots of use
then i tried the digitech rv7
and i agree and i add to that total
no bite to it at all
no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more
once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised
the behringer reputation pulls through once again
it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet
this thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well
if you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star
theyre fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying
it is a small thing but i dont like it
these do very nicely for that purpose
its solid helps with mounting and will be well used
i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound
this is my favorite od pedal that i have
no frills just a plain black strap
if you are looking for s nice rich sound this is it
it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase
but it will cover a good size room also
second unit too had the similar packing but no damages
i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc65
much less surface of the string touching
is the mini sent from heaven
to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
but this is a bargain and small
i would much prefer a round base
its about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability
i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner
thats about the only pro
bonus its an active device so it can boost the signal
this little snark is easy to carry around and works great
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply
i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster
no audible hum detected when using this mic cord either
i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help
he was right  great product
it works just fine and im happy with it
but these picks are pretty amazing
just leave the midswitch on the flat setting
the finish is much darker then the pictures online show
more tubelike sound than a toprated tube amp
the treble and bass control make huge sound differences
get it if you need one
over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made
i am going to be waxing now on
then switch to aquilas for playing
i think this is understandable though
now you wontactually find any actual 2x4s
its as well made as most i think
put them on my daughters guitar and she enjoys them
there is however no mounting point  no captive nuts or such
if it rocks the fingerboard is radiused
this is a good thing  its sensitive
i bought to use for my squire strat
my challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room
i have used all kinds of strings
ive had many mic holders and this one is by far the very best
quality german manufacturing as always
my goto string brand for any stringed instrument
i am done thinking a good pedal must cost 200 and above
if you dont want anything heavy this is good for you
provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars
the case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush
takes some practice to appreciate all the features
its kinda small for my hand but it works great
i think black looks better with my guitar
ive heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit
everything was good except for that one microphone
it is very easy to apply great results and very little effort
no but it doesnt cost as much either
until i can install it i can only really vouch for 45 stars
i may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already
these are what they need to be
if the answer is 34hell yes i deserve them all
the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok
its probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes
i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables
digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible
some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet
seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far
the snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me
it is not too short as one reviewer complained
they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking
it sounds good natural and spacias
i just save the fast 34lower played34 songs for last
i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends
works great with my on stage keyboard stand
switching to these was not a problem at all
the installation takes 2 minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play
the vox model is also really jangly sounding  like its supposed to
it seems strong and stable
i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail
good deal just get it i highly recommend it
these work that well and are almost undetectable from the front
im glad that i bought it
i bought this to replace an actual fullout pa and was very pleasantly surprised
this strap works fine on my fender strat
i am pleased with my purchase
the quality is always the same
i would buy it again
guitar slips a little off my knee
its inexpensive and easy to use
im now a zoom fan
the volume knobs are handy for sure
i have not had one fail on me ever
i like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out
i got mine for use with some behringer mics
it does the job well
i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic
well ill man up and buy something else
this one was a good deal through amazoncom
of the three the phase 90 has the least versatility
authentic replacement screws if you need them
with the exact same settings the fulltone will actually sound much brighter
but they really are cool little stands and i just bought another one lol
i use compressors quite a lot
i use mine with ukulele and guitars and both get tuned accurately with it
a strap is a strap what can you really say about it
the difference is quite noticeable and good
not quite delay not quite reverb
these fit snug on my shure sm58 beta a mics
still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick
update 232009  these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time
the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds
the daddarios are excellent strings and this price on the 10pack was unbeatenanywhere
the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made
this has saved my bass drum head from many holes
works perfectly with ear buds with miccontroller
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
and i like it for starting out learning
i kept it because to be honest it is very cheap
i use this as my 34clean34 sound without the overdrive
4 be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself
i love having the colored cables makes set up so easy
the high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep
i cannot shower enough praise on the lpb1
these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums
they are larger than i expected and rather thick
will this replace a pro fret job
it is very lightweight which is also a plus
additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar
at 220 id have to love it to keep it
i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables
warning for beginners dont get this
the bargooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model
it is better than samsons inexpensive gomic which i also have
drop few more bucks and get something else
maudio was a much better company before avid took them over
no foot pedals or expensive addons until you really have to have them
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website
cons  none to speak of
cons wish i had this 20 years ago
i got what i ordered
they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap
i have this on a cream colored stratlike guitar and it looks great
pros  fits on any guitar
unbelievable instrument a pleasure play
ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it
just buy the product and get on with happy music making
the stand works as advertised
ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly
i will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal board
just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it
i was getting hum from some of my cheaper cables
in fact i typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull
i just dont care for them
the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off
the locking mechanism is great
it does a great job
the price seems fair enough
these strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter bronze nanoweb
these are good cables at a good price
the primary use is for a laguna acoustic
i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin 016ny
these monitors have 70watts powering a 5 woofer and a 1 tweeter 40w30w respectively
i dont hold it against the pedal though
it works and it works well
the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey
electrons go through it and dont leak out so its perfect i guess
so it easy to quickly tune up
i love the fit and the sound quality
ranging from a 12 musiciansfriend promotional item to a 200 rack mount
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
these switches really are very handy
the joyo is an exact clone of the tech 21british pedal which costs 189
plus the price is right
i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound
more importantly the sound doesnt deteriorate with higher volumes
i love this its do fun to play with
i got these because they were recommended replacements for the fostex t50rp
well i must say i am very happy with the purchase
the mic has a headphone jack
but im glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test
these will not be used much
for the price these cant be beat
even using a capo 100 recommended
i use neither of these so i have no comment on their usability
so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables
bought these for my squire strat
the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable
its light but stays in place okay
too bad they made this decision imo
hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes
after consistent use its going strong
this is the last of the cool from shure
the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob
these strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat
this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal
to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
the c1 fits the mount perfectly
it takes up a very negligible amount of space
i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster
it does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back
i have been very pleased with it
you can do it yourself so easily
you can still monitor your playing using the ipads headphone jack separately obviously
i tried these and they make for much easier action
i like the speaker on this amp
it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers
i found the screwon connector to not be that high quality
this stand is worth 1000 tops
i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything
ive only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic
back light on knobs shows clipping on volume green and red and connected green
chorus is on the mellower side
these are pretty soft inside and fit most astyles pretty well
folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag
they bend too easily making rhythm playing impossible
using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
other than that it is what it is and does what it says
i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them
lets be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes
yeah i think a few of these would be nice
my young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one
i dont own the srh840s but rather the srh440s
the bm might work better with solid state
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
still a tight fit though since theres only 834 of wire
im amazed at how good this amp sounds
i can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke i want inside
they work well after adjusting them to fit
quiet  much quieter than other compressors in this price range
it seems to work okay for that
reverb sounds great as well
these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality
i have a dreadnaught resting on it now ready for use
i use it on all my condenser mics
five for tone highmidlow and five for gain
virtually invisible from the front of the guitar
the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb
they last with great tone for a reasonable time and dont break
the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless
the guys prove that the hype was legit
so far it still works well
not my style but they work ok
i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube
ultraportable by using a 9v battery instead of the ac adaptor
the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go
i like this speaker system behringer makes good products when it comes to this
but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before
the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great
this fits the bill perfectly
i love the neck and the back
if the end leathermaterial is too thick the lock wont fit
had i gone with a more expensive model id feel locked in
this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop
they also last quite a long time maybe 7 months
i just keep coming back to these
for most vocals recording i dont use the closet
the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options
they even come with a clamp for your cable
always good to have a stationary mic on the floor
they are fun and kitschy
think i will get another one for the stage monitors
this is simply the best power supply out there
this is a very useful and quite educational musicians piece
they look good and perform well
later saw this one and decided to try it
they are a fantastic mic great quality and construction
ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal
the shielding on these planet waves cables are great
since then ive used nothing else
they work perfect and look good
great speaker stands well constructed easy adjustments for different setups
first a word about joyo
well see how helpful they really are
i stand by my logically opinions of this item
sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother
simply put its well made and works great
very happy with my purchase
i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat
this is a super easy to use pedal
seems great need more time to explore what it can do
and its heavy and not stylish in my opinion
they say 24 months ive never come close to even a month
so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument
there is a gain knob
its easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly
i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss
i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome
i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money
i play 5string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff
i got this pedal recently
good upgrade fender vintage springs
i say perfection because this amp does exactly what i wanted it to do
i bought these for my new strat
really nice looking and heavy duty
for those unfamiliar with voxs amplug products these things are amazing
i had an old wallwart laying around and put it to good use
i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited
it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port
there is an oring to seal the top portion of the threads
at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth
behringer products are good for the semipro
also i read several comments here that this isnt a high gain distortion
not much else to say
there is a metronome function which i havent used
having an fx send is awesome when using it live
my last thought on this this is a secret come closer
i bought a 2nd one
50 and thicker in case youre looking for very thin ones
they shipped quickly and didnt break the bank
i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued
so thats four broken strings in less than 20 hours play
thats not the case here
what about the eh metal muff
the jf15 was a curiosity purchase
most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot
a 2 item cost 1770 for shipping
good material good zippers good design
its crazy but that is what i am experiencing
it works well pretty good buy
i gave it five stars
thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok
it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order
great for gigging remote events
so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand
the max grip just is very difficult to drop effortless to hold on to
this is a pretty decent guitar
im glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup
great product and one that i will continue to use
i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board
get it and see you will be blown away
i bought new strings but havent replaced them yet
i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one
these are a new style of guitar pick to me
so again another reason for the 5th star
or so the historical theory goes
i have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so its probably fairly wellshielded
in addition this one has a metronome
i have been running it with pro tools 9 since 2011
i have them turned all the way down almost
distortion pitch shifter chorus then out
when not in use i keep it parked on the headstock
string sound is a personal thing
but it seems lacking to me
no more chasing pitch for me
however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet
well i got a recording without sound
i prefer a standard pick for that
had issues before with company but they resolved all issues
i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space
having the pick pocket is a neat feature
its lightweight but very stable even with a heavy bass drum mic
its inexpensive and the padding is excellent
60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the same
if you need cables these work great
great deal for the money
such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz
it is better than my intelli 600 which i also like
i got these for my dad for christmas
ive had this for 4 days and im so glad i bought it
ive even put them in a vice and filed new points on them
in fact that may be saying too much
i am playing out of a peavey but i hear a tweed
try to practice for about an hour daily
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
45 db isnt much at all for any decent mic preamp
the negatives and why i cant recommend it are as follows
and there are two clicks to choose from
the display is bright and clear
most of my recording lately has been done with various apple platforms
i still have open leads for those other pedals
i did find the bundled cakewalk software useless
i am very happy with the elixir brand strings
i can bend the gstring easier than a super slinky
its like playing a silk guitar
i could not beat the price
pitch black is so cool
i had to tune my guitar and i bought this
a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design
ordered a few of these
these are my favorite strings to use on my american strat
excellent sound quality and i would pin them against bose any day
they fit great and plenty of screws
my thumbs arent tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average
i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well
other than that they appear ok
link to a bass amp or subwoofer and you definitely have full sound
aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound
i shouldve just got this cable the first time
all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort
plenty of sound effects to mess around with
customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this
if it matters to you the white ends are very well white
a few months later the high e string unwound from the ball end
some of us arent that luckyor giftedor smart
this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric
the ultimate in low tech
the sn1 senses frequency through vibration
great strings and they last well
analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy
if you understand what this is for i think its a great idea
this one is my favorite turn on and go
it will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the master
between these blues and the yellow im covered
an hour after its applied it sets up and doesnt get on your hands
fit and installationregarding fit these have 2 little pins on the backside
i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them
it even comes with a matching polyester gigbag
you just cant beat the speed and convenience of amazon
no dropping guitars around here
dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument
i guess as long as both are still available exl111 being phased out
the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly
this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price
excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic squire strat series
great design easy to read works better than 2 other brand tuners i own
as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built
this is not how the world of music sounds
they hold a variety of guitars just fine
however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity
you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves
my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding
actually much better than i expected for the price
it does the job as described it though
it also worked perfectly on my roland rd300nx but i expected that
but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too
other then that it works just like it says it will
ive not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking
this is one great piece
if youre looking for some good trs cables
its very good quality like all planet waves products
then carefully drilled two holes per tuner
these great little accessories are a nice convenience
ever since i started playing the guitar ive used the nylon dunlop picks
the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well
the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones
i have been using these for months now with 5string bass
this is the first quickchange capo ive owned
its soft without being limp
good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around
so i used the builtin microphone to tune my guitar
white thin picks by fender what else can i say
however i have loaded the software on my laptop
i like this one a lot
updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses
i am going to be finding picks in my files for years
plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch
well padded and will not damage your instrument
either way once plugged in it sounds great
i couldnt be happier with the purchase
i have no complaints it is my go to mic
it is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects
this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right
getting ready to make few ukes and it will tune them also
this is a really nice thick strap
what a great aframe stand especially for the money
it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me
the bright colors make them difficult to lose
ive owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw
it did what i wanted  then some
for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so
even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same
like they were custom made for your guitar
i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners
then choose comfortable straps that wont scratch your guitar like this one
id say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection
it also has a lock on the case in case one might need it
you may be careful around it but its hard to say for others nearby
to my ears this is a sm58
better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen
i put the nyxl set on my ibanez artist with dimarzio  humbuckers
great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers
i bought this pedal to semiretire an older ibanez ts5 soundtank
the cloth is just what i wanted
i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc
i prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord
i use these on my fender strat and they sound great
i will definitely recommend these
i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great
power is about 46 hours of continuous recording
the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand
i wouldnt buy anything else
i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight
i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life
it leaves very little rosin dust on the violin
works well since i got it
60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick
kidding aside this thing is really nice
fender medium my favorite guitar pick a dozen should last a while right
i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythmlead work is required
this is a very nice tool
it works great with reaper
never got this shine in my guitar with any other product
i was immediately struck by how solid this case feels
its easy to read and dead on
its regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard
i was very suprised that it was this effective
eventually i ended up uninstalling it
i like cool gadgets  and this is no exception
thats where the yamaha really falls short
it does what is supposed to and it doesnt have a cheap look
bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction
as others have noted the finish can vary drastically
the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate
ive used all the ins and outs with no problems
i use a onespot plug to power it
i have heard that some are too long for it
bucks for an 8input mixer
this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great
i will use these for my lower end stuff i will probably sell anyway
time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick
and at 5 why wouldnt you give them a shot
not much to say about this one
ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time
this will last a very long time
if was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood
they last for ever and never cause buzz or noise
the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb
secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp
i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products
he said that you can hear the guitar but barely
you cant go wrong with daddario strings
you can easily connect it to a computer windowsmac with the included usb cable
my daughter had a great time getting used to it
finish your serch and buy this one
not on my newer sg thoughat least with the new screws it comes with
no metronome but thats what im keeping the korg for
i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough
purchased this for my son to use on his guitars
i play guitar and stand behind the vocalists
although i ordered three of them
my other snark is still going strong
this strap is really beautiful
i dont think i can say enough good things about the samson sp01 shockmount
it also occasionally fails to register at all
the stand can be used with or without the upper brace
the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use
i was told it was just as good as the fender case
i either use the 9s or the 10s and detune them
this product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
it looks better in person than in the pic too
a guitar player can never have enough of these things around
dont recall if i purchased it on amazon
best buy on the market
i used to be able to deal with it
or if you like both equally
i bought this strap for a esp ec1000 les paul style guitar
fender heavies what more needs to be said
im more than happy with it but just dont know what else to add
solid attachment to bass drum
i used to lose a pick every other day
it will overheat the amp and start acting weird
the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound
but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume
the tuner works amazing as well
used on my acoustic guitar
too low and it does not sound right
the system is a secure locking system
i would pay the price again in a hartbeat
microphones cables straps tuner etc
the snark sn1 is by far the best
okay back to the explanation
i would definitely buy this brand again
very stable clamp mechanism works very well
they are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers
i am very glad i made this purchase
there is a rich toney presence to these springs
good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly
never thought itd be my goto pedal
i use this cable for small home recording projects
recommended if your budget is limited
the result is quite appealing
i decided to give it a good set up
i will buy these again
so far ive been super pleased by joyo pedals
is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet
if youre an active performer maybe
this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away
this plug works very well
i own a native instruments maschine mikro
i am a novice guitar player
i wont hold it against these windscreens
just a great chorus with not much to tweak
best looper for the money
the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move
his old one lasted about 10 years
when they work theyre absolutely great and theyre so cheap
youll definitely want to check these out
grips soft loose and yet well
retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied
the quality of these guides is not what i expected
so far i am a very satisfied customer with this cable
practice amp this is the amp for u its definitely high quality its got
i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there
they engage and disengage without binding or looseness
i store them in a little sandwich bag
and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars
the pics and description dont show just how insanely large this is
next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing
i am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip
i bought this based on video reviews on the net
if you have a lower end guitar this will make a huge difference
70 db would be better
i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost
allinall i found no flaw in these strings
ill post an update if this speaker fails
i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results
its nice and easy to use
so i suggest you to use the power adapter
it changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar
this was a great purchase
this one produces a great tone and is wellmade
the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated
i always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal
it sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches
simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime
this is the one pedal i cant do without
a bit invasive and awkward
the great thing about it is the length
i own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there
so it will work the same with both
if you need a simple normallength strap this should work fine
what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently
but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica
its the least obtrusive and best capo ever
however i did encounter one strange thing
i actually have the same criticism of my tech 21 triac really excellent pedal
the casing is made of heavy duty i dont know what gauge solid steel
so i got these and they are awesome
neck and frets are straight level and do not snag
they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time
item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging
they function well and are inexpensive
it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at hp level
fifth comes with an ac adapter
guess ill go back to daddario and ernie ball
i would buy from this company again and probally will in the future
same thing with strings that break while tuning them up
but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok
will be updating when i get the vintage 12ax7 tube replacement
this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
so why have i never tried their egit strings
what more could you want
it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear
for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal
i have one thats over 4 years old and still going strong
my level is usually around 25 to 40 and is still very loud
good price and selection here
these strings are the best
the good this box is simple and welldesigned
the classic vibe 60s strat really impresses me through this amp
i have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet
it sounds great for recording
yea it was coming from vegas to ny but 10 days
i will buy it again
seem to be of a good value
then the intellitouch tuner hit the market
that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words
now im buying another strap so i will have one on either guitar
operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass
second is holding its own
other people will love them though
i also like the capo tuning feature
so choose whichever color you prefer and go for it
within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt2
a spring clamp type capo would serve better
five stars for being a better jazz iii
the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong
i like to ride my bike and take my uke along
it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now
it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box
they just dont feel as solid to me
fender tends to make good products
like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros
the grill and the frame around the grill are solid
this is the tuner you want
its just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph
after a dunlop lock failure i decided to change over
i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house
this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod
even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results
that is if it lasts that long
ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not
i have not used any lock system thats perfect
the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about
having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier
you get what you pay for
the builtin effects are probably its weakest point
i really dont like this
and was actually pleasantly surprised that the snark sn2 had a mic
correctly tuned this very old guitar for the first time in years
and thats a good thing
bought bass case for stratwanted extra space
i cant find a single complain about this amp
i have used both and i am satisfied with both
behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality
when it arrived the volume pot was not working
i have a 1993 taylor which is in mint condition
its simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality
they mate perfectly with 14 receptacles on guitars and amps
clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out
many great features including an onthefly samplerlooper
it sounds for the most part in tune and its tone is great
however i may have added too much humidity
i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end
and yes pop filters are a must with condenser microphones
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more
the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less staticlike etc
the tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are ok
i am impressed with daddarios electric strings
terrific trippy pearl tones and azures
it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold
oh and did i mention accurate
i cant let on what ive done to mine because
i have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar
and by similar i mean clip on
a heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged
at that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy
its well constructed and i have not encountered any issues with the twopiece bottom
heres the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender
cables even good ones eventually break
sooooo everything i said initially is still true
it operates on two aa batteries included
for a clipon you cant beat the accuracy this little unit gives you
it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away
but chances are both will sound good
i am so happy she did
i really like these things
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs
they are a great idea
the 2nd one works flawlessly
you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher
these strings speak with a bolddefined and powerful voice
personally i just love the daddario strings
the guitars do not sit very well in this stand
this is what i came to
this is the second clip on tuner i have bought
used the 942s for years but thought i would give these a try
i own two of these
i havent tried many different strings
hey if it makes our son happy so be it
ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid
not expecting much i adjusted the tension
works with downloadable xedit software
10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp
mics i have tried yet
well i dont really know what else to say
the clamp is strong enough that it will stay put
i think thats the way it really sounds
for the price its definitely worth it imho
lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived
i have had good luck with wd40 too but it is very flammable
34  ive been used to the traditional 3position switch on my other telecasters
i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment
dont waste your  on others with similar specs
great durable foam contact points for cradling baby
lolwould allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice
i purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear
i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now
this pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless
this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described
no humhiss from these units at all
it is smaller than a snark but not by much
both ends are the same  leather
but otherwise worth the price and a good doodad to have around
is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
im switching to the planet triaction
in particular they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars
if i had the money id stick one of these on all my guitars
this is a great little addition to both my violin and my mandolin
but on my washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there
its not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me
i still play this on almost every day
long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod
i compared this against the fostex mr8mkii which i also own and like
ive had this pedal for a number of years
easy to use with one knob
recommend for small budget studios
you wont find a better deal than this on a basic headphone ampmixer
speaking of power adapters  a previous reviewer is right
what more could you ask for
tried it didnt like it returned it
dab fast fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced
replace it with another broke a product
i would suggest the snark sn1
i only paid 299 which is simply an outstanding deal
taylor logo makes it look good and official
the clean tones on this are just great
it does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality
i dont need to worry about batteries any more
thats been a few years ago
for the price id expect a more durable product
at this price why not
more mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack and less lows
all the proline shure mics are top quality
ill likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts
is that weird to say
have tons of picks  but seem to use this one all the time
not too thicknot too thin
additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door
i bought these recently and i love them
this is the second tuner i have bought like this
at first i thought it was the noise suppressor
tried everything i could but its gone
its quite expensive for 4oz
i have never broke a daddario acoustic string
its easy and clear and everything a tool should be
this capo fits so easily
having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation
the run around at the post office of getting it resent was ridiculous
its about one and a half inches wide by the way
i would recommend it to those who can afford it
it is one of the best value i have purchased
other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss
as a matter of fact i ordered 2 more
i feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks
well this cable certainly didnt last long as the title says 8 weeks
this is a sturdy case that looks good too
this is a lovely wall mount for your guitar
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
the 34fingers34 will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly
plenty for classic rock and blues
do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this
the carrying case is also nice
it saves you so much money
i have never had it go out of tune while playing even when stringbending
they go in tune and stay in tune
to me daddario are just as good
id give it 4 stars
well made cable with bulletproof molded ts protection
i seem to like them all
i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it
anyway these seem to hold up a little better
i got 2 of these for my electric guitars
cant say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design
they are cheap and look good
they have all the features and versatility youll ever need
distortion is incredibly subjectiveit depends on your rig and your tastes
2 the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged
just like every other strap of its kind
it has a durable metalic case
i would recommend for sure
but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the deans
i would recommend this to any guitar player
on its tallest setting this gives me the exact height i need
i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these
i love the fact that this controller has full size keys
be sure to check out all the dimensions though
you have to install the battery which is no big deal
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
i know it will come in handy sooner or later
despite appearances this mic is no bargain
but the price is right and the stand is solid enough
sadly when i tried to use them amp it didnt work
i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing
so far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough
i have owned two of these stands
they tune well and hold a tune well
it began to tear on my guitar strings
any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it
pick wearing is virtually nonexistent and i utilize altpicking a lot in my practices
this simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables
i carry a backup pedal
i purchased a power supply to go along with it
while the delay is surprisingly good you cant customize it
turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when youre not playing
i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods
we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out
i didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is
sometimes i find it a bit too long but i dont mind
these are great strings for such a rare instrument
wow a bench that really holds my ass
ive swapped out the tuners and have never looked back
a lifetime warranty means youll have it forever
this amp does almost too much for the money
i expect the pick to wear down from use
it doesnt come with a foot switch
guitar pics what more can i say
the answer is it gets 4 stars
the size is 34just right34 not too small or big
if youre looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely
i work with a guy who has played guitar for 30 years
its safe all latches match up well
they are a little scratchy on the edges
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel correctly
another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass
i feel that its a good deal and  recommend it
another great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v18v
its simple built well and and fun to use
so i got my full order
so easy to use and portable and cheap
i still need to read a lot of the users manual
it has a good ring to it
hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last
in fact it works really nice
when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldnt be hype
this is a pretty good nonexpensive capo
it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much
im not sure how its possible
lastly these plugs are huge
this was my first fender amp as well
this is great but i needed an actual soundhole cover
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
the good inexpensivecontains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etc
i tried every brand until i got to these
the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control
the base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy
it was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront
it will tune practically anywhere   loud rooms etc
only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps
but its a very good strap
then i saw this one
anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic
a great investment thatll last quite a long time
2nd updatetried out several compatible tubes
check it out the reviews on youtube
plus its fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas
and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own
i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay
the term stomp box isnt supposed to be taken literally
im sold out on joyo pedals
i own several gig bags and this is my favorite
i wrote the company described the problem
doesnt say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned
perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes
i like them a lot
only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort
another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot
they used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves
it does what a guitar tuner should do
this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received
edit 10232012i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board
60 nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection
elixer definitely still has the edge
material is similar to my messenger bags strap
the name says it all
a little disappointed with the cable
this is a great buy under 10 bucks for a quality cord
i dont know how a pro would rate this
ok ill add a star your right i should add a star
i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews
i needed it for nothing else so im happy
this discipline once a habit is good enough
i have an esp eclipse
planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product
i have had zero issues with these
other than the price the strings work great on my guitar
this 25 watt amp will get the job done
however i hate the plastic housing and how the inputoutput jacks are located
very happy and pleased with this one
very sturdy and very well made
34  just get one that doesnt get in your way
tried this and was not happy
the quality is good the smell was funny when first opened
when i take the batteries out no problem
the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great
this does the job perfectly
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired
a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings
i really like the h4ns design the menus and controls are nicely organized
the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package
a lot of options available with this goodsounding pedal
whenever i played with traditional strings my fingertips would turn green
but these were trashed in a month
the flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked
ive been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels
this is a good pick
id prefer a better stand however i question its existence
play an ibanez acoustic electric
i prefer a bigger pocket but aside from that i cant complain
tried as i might i could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of
these arent diamonds or gretsch but theyre fantastic
volume pedal you need to use an effect bank
i am happy with it
this was a great purchase
me not so muchill just leave it hang
perfect for my beginner studio setup
perfect for the garage band
you really cant go wrong for the money
i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked
they havent changed much dont fix it if its not broken
he badly needed an upgrade from his ludwig jr kits bass pedal
most 12ax7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should
with the humidpak you have a lot more security
the ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way
currently theyre 1199 on here compared to 499 or less for the regular version
will try other brands next time
im happy with the reults my 40 got me
i like daddario strings but these did not impress me
i tried different cables with it
after twisting on it twice i stripped it out
a good solid piece of equipment
it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine
its great and stands up to much more expensive of its kind
their differences for your  ears
they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place
there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing
pocketsized headphone amps and so on
the wire could be a little heavier but you cant beat the value
holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording
5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer
they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable
so far it has lived up to my expectations
that just means it will breakin that much more quickly
dont force me to buy an accessory just to power it up
now could you use it for a gig
it is definitely worth the few extra bucks
wish id have gotten something a little nicer though
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
i will buy these again for sure
the quality of the locking tuners looks great
they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone
this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand
unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop
check out the video reviews by the userscompanies goldhat3 samashmusic giggear and shadowfw
these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick
this is a great microphone for 10 bucks did i just say 10
battery runs out fast so get an ac adaptor
also the case is nice
this is a quick easy improvement
from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit
i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo
lets hope this is just a shortterm fluke
i do need a boom to keep the mic
other than the above excellent pedal
it fits my jasmine es31c dreadnought acousticelectric guitar just fine
all and all a super practice amp or micable performance amp
overall a good deal for the price
my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs
i will definitely be washing my hand right after using it
overall though itll do the job
does a good job for a basic delay
i was rather skeptical of this little box amp but it works great
not cheap or poorly made at all a great value
attaching it is a snap
installed on two guitars and i love them
these cables are good xlr noisefree cables
ive used ernie balls slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades
i tend to use cleaning sprays
but its much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that
you can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh sounding
the missing38 of an inch is a minor detail
it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost
the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support
by now in contrast i would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones
pin 3 then ties to pin 1 with the ground wire
it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up
follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension
it gets the job done easily and very fast
i going to see if i can return them for store credit
but i had serious questions about the classic rock amplug
which is good if you are as clumsy as i am
i like the tones i get from these and the price is very good
remember this is overdrive  not distortion
this is a sweet guitar strap
nice to keep your mic nice and fresh
ive used shubb for years
so because of the limitations i rate it as above
the tone as i say is pretty darn good
is a high quality instrument cable but low cost wont break the bank
no more unpluggingplugging inbetween songs
sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss pedal
ive used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps
this unit is well constructed
ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists
the padding is good and soft
this is too short for most adults that play guitar
big and wide enough to handle any guitar
it is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way
im very satisfied with my purchase
they work just as well as the more expensive ones i have used
not a lot of white clipon tuners around
the best sound i got was on my strat
i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it
just click the buy it button
is a nice cablegod quality  as always with the fender brand
i ordered three of these
this unit is quiet and very handy
that might thow a few folks off but its a little thing really
great little pedal economical and worked flawlessly
looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered
i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here
this pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound
suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these
i though it would be like the pianos sustainer
wow  it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities
i think the price is a little high for what it is
you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time
i also bought the green one
what you see in the picture is what you get
so i decided to sign in and write this review
this amp is perfect for me
i would recommend these to anyone
never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft
the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable
my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products
luckily i have no need for the clip
it doesnt come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like
the real treat is the tone switch
great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
that said i find it useful for composing on the road
i restrung my martin 016ny with these strings and found them to be excellent
it could be from shipping
this is a very well made guitar stand
no i do not work for tascam
no they do equal to my boss counterparts
says its easier to use than the smaller cloths weve gotten before
pedaltrain makes a great pedal board
this stand holds up my ukulele so yay
that may have damaged a contact
i imagine ill stick with them for this machine from now on
the overdub layering is simply superb though its saved as mono
but aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound
it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem
the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone
the range of this delay fortunately is quite wide
i also received one without a battery which upset me at the time
and it looks very professional
great strings with a good feel to them
with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly
i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background
did what it was suppose no need to say anymore
also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables
think of it as a supplumentary effect
my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug
the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday
you get what its advertised to do
instead its in a landfill
the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping
good display and very easy to use
the colors punch out nice and will1
as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price
guess thats why the price is so cheap
this product puts my older laptop besides newer ones
i figured it would go the same way as the threeway  wrong
i absolutely love these strings
cheap accurate over mic even better over jack
it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for
oh well it was cheap enough to have around
so why this particular capo
one thing you will need though is a phantom power unit
i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar
the korg is the perfecttuner
did i mentioned great value
if its a new project always drill pilot holes anyway
the ds1 does not warm up the tone in your amp
i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one
i ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks
i own three shubbs a kyser a dunlop and one of those rolling capos
will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only
the tascam dp008ex is great
with the xedit you call up a canned sound and start changing it
i love it when i am the only one using it
i have these on all three of my fenders
it really makes your guitar shine
this proves that easy helps
casual part time guitar player here
it works and does at it is supposed to
nice mids and ringing highs
bracing is light  the entire guitar is light
i love these picks they are my favorite
i mean my computer is really stripped down
does what it should as expected
i like ernie ball strings
buttons and sliders and great for the price
the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though
once you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhere
very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer
this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard
the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very wellmade
ive been playing for 8 years and i own 4 electric guitars
you have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere
originally i purchased a behringer eq700 equalizer pedal for my rig
i ordered this as a spare and at this time i havent used it
for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once
very good tunner with bypass switch
using this on my ibanez art100 electric guitar
quality can be found behind the fender name
the old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and 34alive34
cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke
for some reason i thought theyd have different thicknesses from a previous review
at first the e overtoned the b and e
they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with
you really should try it yourself to understand
this pedal works but doesnt have the depth of echo i expected
these assorted picks are really all the same just different colors
the picks are great and i couldnt be happier with the order
if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it
the guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case
i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more
for 13 its hard to say anything bad about this gadget
the craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb
it seems sturdy and well built
mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark
the nanowebs went on my 1970s guild d35
able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily
what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand
very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price
this is a quality product
the reproduction of the sound was very good
ive had similar problems with other pyle products
i would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze
best i could find for this time of hard case
even without strap locks im comfortable going crazy on stage
these are the only ones i buy now
ive found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more
the strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets
my hats off to joyo
it is simple and does its job well
wonderful piano feel piano action
this is usually a little more than i require when jamming
all speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot
the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze
the handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles
this will be more than fine
i give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated
ive been using this item for about 3 weeks now and i love it
i play in small tight places
unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand
works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well
but since i found a good solution i dont think its worth the effort
my guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65
im really surprised at how well they perform
it just slides on the tip of the tripod
but i just cant get myself to do it
nothing gimmicky or faulty just perfect
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison
nowhere is it mentioned there wouldnt be any or i could have ordered one
you wont find that in anything else under 300
very serviceable easy to use sturdy
the buckle doesnt seem to bother me
these daddarios have worn quite well and still sound excellent
and gavemy grandson a shockblue one to go with his american flag painted uke
a great amp for practice and beginners
the neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing
manual should have been include not sure about the cord
ive just got the shure sm58 microphone
the switch well we will have to wait and see
once hooked up i was very surprised how flimsy it is
i love this mic as an indoor studio mic
i use ctype snapon strap locks but they will no longer fit
i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights
he said he loved them
calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red
just forget about trying to use the display
their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception
they all need an external windscreen but only the sm7b comes with one
the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand
do you want to play master of puppets by metallica
folds up easy fits great
low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11 00
just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord
my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings
but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses
good product so far just wouldnt recommend it
individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth
i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed
they even work on cymbals if youre looking for a quicker decay
you will not be sorry with this purchase
makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy
i got the sound i wanted
the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on
and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner ive ever used
this is a proven classic
this is true but isnt a complete description
they are perfect for rhythm flexible
one of the connections broke that is
it sounds great right out of the box
and i got a string cleaner by fender
very happy with these cables
ive bought three for gifts
i have a long way to go
further more do i stick with the same brand
thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web
it does a marshall pretty well
my wah wah a morley power wah was almost useless with it
this is a 5 star stand considering the price
dava 6024 grip tipitem is as advertised
however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely
too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead
plus its on sale right now so snatch one before theyre all gone
and theres a reason for that it isnt
ive bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet
i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely
it fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes
it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish
so for now im good but in a few weeks ill need new strings
nothing bad to say about this strap
the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life
no damage at all to any of them
the extra adapters are a nice touch
the actual cable is horrible
now i just need to get used to playing with 5 strings
the mic holder has the same issue
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for 80
the 9s are super slinky just like the name says
i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support
10 picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company
crystal clear and it doesnt color the recordings
very well made although the bag is a little lower quality
haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks
so what are the presets
i am in the process of returning it
but i just need to stretch them out
what works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another
otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel
great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin
theres no instruction which is fine
but thats a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument
for the price this is a fantastic buy
this is lownoise compared to the mxr and simple to use
this little tuner is made to be left on one guitar
the coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure
the wire cutters also work really well
the build quality seems questionable from mxr
so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money
when it comes to the low end these are lacking
it does a good job for the price
just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job
played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better
sounds good and the action is smooth
they do not have any detectable noise or issues
below is thewarning verbatim from amazon
stays in place well and is very convenient
meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee
i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one
the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard
this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter
a backward sustain pedal is not fun
none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying
the product is well built easy  to use pretty straightforward
anyway my pros and conspros1
more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs
i thought id try something else out and settled on this one
great price from the seller as well
the best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3pack
this has more features than ill ever likely use
i have owned just about every tuner made
its solidly built and i dont imagine it will break easily
i use earnie ball strings as my backup strings
feels like wearing a 10 casio with a 1300 suit
a couple of the marshall settings arent bad either
spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier
it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances
ive been using one of these kysers for a good while now
these jjs work really great
overall this is a great board
a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories
the only way to shut off the power is to unplug it
i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture
the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing
but it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects
ive tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best
its a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose
i wish i had more of a passion to play it but
after hearing how great it is i decided to buy it
amazing what a 20 piece plastic can do
it belongs in front of a tube amp period
if i ever need another ill be getting another fender gig bag
the sound is very natural and true to my voice
it is comfortable around my neck and shoulder
very similar to a ehx memory man it does it all
because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone
no cheap way is there
i expect to buy more of these in the future
the picks have almost zero flex to them meaning the player has solid control
as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on
i have a mim 2012 strat every thing went together with out any issues
these have not rusted so far
for that i gave four stars instead of five
used these while putting together my personal bluesclassic rock frankenstrat
for me it sounded better than sm58
the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video
power to the pedals rock on
it is usable for applications like speaking
it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable
strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle
i will probably pick up a white cotton strap
this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul
i must first state for the record i hate strap locks
it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin
for 10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar
using  the 12vac output on my fuel tank chameleon works great
id buy this again in a heartbeat
id buy this again without hesitation though
no issues at all and they look good
ive 34first act34 brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed
the little limiter lamp is awesome
the reviews on all joyo products are extremely polarizing
my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a nobrainer
i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday
constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment
or so their packaging claims
rogue is musicians friends brand
first the good   this instrument is a good beginner piece
however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible
my fingers were squeeking  sticking on the strings  back of neck bad
nice cables for the price
this mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears
i didnt realize everything else this pedal can do
this thing is simply beautiful
for my desired application this guitar was great
i dont ever worry that itll tip over
they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing
however i had to give the tuner a try as well
these strings are very nice and sound great
loved the fender super champ probably the best but there wasnt a headphone jack
you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those
attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice nonslip surface
they may wind up damaging their guitar
i have used dunlop straplocks for 32 years
and the tascam th02 keeps up
the best deal for recording beginners
they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise
if you love delay and want variety this is your pedal
i prefer no cheap imitations
its not so 34digital and bright34 delay like boss dd3 or dd7
several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck
the metronome will drive you crazy
it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound
the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs
last distortion pedal youll ever need
the other are for me one as a backup
thats either an annoyance or great
as good as a hard case
like i said the build quality is outstanding
whatever the waveform is its not a sine wave not smooth at all
it has geared tuners not friction pegs
it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat
also bought the 25 length and used them on an assignment recently
the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money
i get a good clean sound on my vocals
overall they are attractive wellmade hangars
they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability
this one sticks well to the guitar
probably wont be a daily driver but interesting none the less
i couldnt figure out the different tunings on it though
also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little
i didnt use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable
behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc9
initially the product didnt work
handel is very comfortable too
the behringer headphone amp was only ok
i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear
i can say its pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer
they were just what i needed
i say they sound great and are worth trying
i point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and gibson electronics
because they feel good against your fingers
this happened at least three times already
this is a great strap
want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good allround metal tone
came in a timely manner from sam ash
i havent seen much more expensive ones with these features
this item does not travel well and is best used at home gently
i had it up and running in a few minutes
good quality parts on an essential product
you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop
i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them
i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine
and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare
i had signal loss using these cables
go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered
tuner is right on overdrive seems fine
its easy for him to use and adjust
the whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube
a great buy as the price was perfect as well
my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin
i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk
a power conditioner will sometimes help as well
pick that is i did have an older brother
just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal
it has a very natural sound is reliable and amazingly strong
its small and conveniently stored too
to them i8217d say these are worth checking out
this a very clever idea
this works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three
also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth
try a set and see what i mean
i couldnt get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal
ended up i picked dr07mkii for slightly less
i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good
i often record one part of a duet then play along with it
fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant
the real jewel in the crown tho is the instruction book
its easy to use and it overdubs
grip is good and the thickness is just right for me
this is a really amazing portable midi keyboard
i teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele
when these slip away ill order more
yes the battery is difficult to replace
thought id give it a try
i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac
for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth  lol
its virtues are many and varied
clamp it on press the power switch and then  pluck a string
for 20 this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation
in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively
the first five have three different levels of style each
2 1534 speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet
if you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out
theres also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level
this one i like for my vocals live
and yes i double checked the packaging to ensure i was shipped large
the light works really well and that was what i was looking for
the sound is great good balance between highs and lows
the exl110bt strings are about 500 a set
i might have done something wrong
if you are considering this instrument dont hesitate
it delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me
i wasnt expecting it to be such high quality
im glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available
you need to view it head on
i bought this on a whim
for those of us who find acoustic guitars difficult to play this is solution
this holder grips the ipad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue
i highly recommend this product
does what its suppose to
these picks break way too easy
not much else you can say about it
i didnt run it without this power source that seems too ghetto
money well spent on this one for sure
these big stubby picks have solved that problem
cheap and easy to use cant beat these picks
i was looking for a financially good deal
i have a gibson les paul that i bought used
it looks really good sturdy and well made
i have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades
this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar
that alone can cause problems
sorry if im rambling but seriously im in love with this pedal
dont have adhesive to bind on the surface
reed plate replacements are about 19
it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with
sometimes its noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible
but it may not hold up forever
you will not be sorry
it has no headroom even on the 5w setting
i strayed briefly on a fender smart capo
its a 20 amp it does what it has to and does it well
bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine
unfortunately it doesnt fit on top of our harp
how can you beat that
you cant go wrong with these
one person may love them the next may not
maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on it
i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal
the stand is worth the price and more
over a simple usb headset without 34breaking the bank34
all in all 7 very well spent
i broke down and im glad i did
this is super warm and can get very trippy
often cheap cords die within a year or so
put em in your case and dont be unprepared
works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course
even a kid can use it with a guitar
same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new
ieutf8psc1 planet waves patch cables theyre listed at
i use this little guy in connection with my daw and digital piano
the graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it
no other choice on the market imho
every one in my band uses this tuner
i dont need to use them myself
wish i had found this stuff sooner
looks cool but thats it
especially if you like to save your single strings for use
constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp
these strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
these sound good on my electrics
as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
i have two complaints about it though
so in short id buy it again
finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple
get something better that doesnt twist up an ravel into knots
blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product
nice clear tones with this pick tips
it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast
if youre wondering how to get neutrikmogami cables cheap make them yourself
here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller 1 bulky
and the blue pedal isnt any different either imo
works as advertised but the keys are stiff
i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers
very close to the sound of an sm58
dont write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind
when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly
its really smallnoticeably smaller than the red jazz iii picks
you cant beat these for the price
i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible
this is not worth the money
i recived this guitar today2813and its perfect
this is made with a moveable arm between the tuner and the clip
i also love the daddario make
if you get stuck using batteries plan on 34 hours worth of use
longevity yet to be seen
come on guys not all of your customers are 13 years old
so it works well for that
and i saved about 70 or 80 bucks
is working very good 100 satisfaction
other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal
as a result i feel im  either too tall or too short
it is an excellent backup capo
it may not be a 5star intrument but its a 5star value
this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had
ive also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better
many musicians use two delay pedals
i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word
we both seem pretty happy with it
works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room
use a shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing
i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot
the sound quality is also very decent
perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart
but its really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise
not really concerned about that but its worth mentioning
make sure your mic holder fits
it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar
when i tested it out i was blown away
the dorky pad around the handle
this amp is non stop fun
great stand for managing multiple guitars
sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that fatal blow
i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions 1
its totally silent very bright display sensitive meter
i have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetishcom which works well
2 i use the black white and blue colors
note that there is no guitar cable
these make me a better player
no fancy expensive flashy grip features
seems like i made a good choice
i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model
i have used daddario for a number of years
great tool and has two different modes which is cool
i have an electro acoustic martin second hand but without a scratch
then id try a different set every 3 days
nice unit and works perfectly for vocalsguitar bass guitar and keyboards
nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone
there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box
relatively transparent and controls are responsive
the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks
i did not need it for that
it also has a nicely padded handle
ive been stringing my guitars with daddario for several years
simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end
ok so i just installed these things for my krk 6s no stands
its easy to forget its there
they are easy to play
the tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement
it is great for a quick way to get electrified
i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable
without debate this will add weight to your guitar
nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great
if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it
so the padding material coating could have been better made
also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning
otherwise sound quality is excellent
i cannot recommend it strongly enough
lightweight small simple to use and its easy to read in broad daylight
so the sample from the vine
i didnt know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps
i wanted an amp that would have overdrive and i also wanted some power
perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle colored
the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools
anyways i buy it from amazon and the packaging is great
it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around
it does what it is supposed to
but thats been my overall experience with digitech stuff for a long time
be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however
i play the soprano concert tenor and baritone
really satisfied with the chair
it fits exactly like an original fender hard case
i normally use my korg footswitch tuner for my guitar and basses
i dont trust it and amazon has it way over priced
this model is the lowest priced but youre buying a reputable brand
anyway i figured since the pedal was so cheap why not try it out
heres an entertaining howto video that will walk you through it
its pretty easy to overpower the computers input and cause distortion
i have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords
fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky
this is your best option for a top flight pedalboard
i figure it tells wouldbe thieves what theyre getting
come on i wont bite
but the sound just lacked warmth
i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily
i is accurate just doesnt respond to the string a fast
of course i am just a beginner
not happy with the sellers description or the product
its great to have sustain again on my keyboard again
it runs fine on batteries also
make a note it is not a metal pedal
now we have the beehold picks
couldnt be happier with this product
and it is the best bet for the money
it looks and feels so high quality
a boss eq is solid and all yes but cost alot more
too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch
i bought this for my son to clean his guitar with
excellent quality and is very comfy
its a cheap speaker stand
for a cheap eq it does great
i bought a washburn rx40 with duncan usm
the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use
i will probably stick with daddario since i dont find any difference in them
i just got the 3rd monitor
that at some point the tradeoff does indeed make sense
of course its not great
the length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children
good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner
not special but not disappointing either
all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark
i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro
a pick that stays in hand
great deal for the very low price
this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne
well worth the money spent
it might even be over 34engineered34 it fits so well
i really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening
the leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps
you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this
the display is bright and the interface is very intuitive
physically it is built strong too
i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal
the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well
i still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner
i was shocked by how well it works
i narrowed it down to 3  korg aw2 snark sn1  intelli imt900
this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound
holds sheet music as it is intended to do
but i think if youre lucky if just might get the job done
not the same as a mxr so dont get your hopes up on that
as i strummed each string to sound was so clear
when this showed up in a cable search on amazon i jumped on it
i use these on an old gibson semihollow body
capos are not something that i shop for
definitely try this before you buy it
thank u joyo im your number 1 customer
strings are not just strings
the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand
it is very stable and solidly constructed
still needed a nice touch
i like the brit setting
i would recommend it as a good economical all around amp
its built like a tank
i do like this set of speakers
so whats then point of all this
its a brilliant idea haha
here is a comparison of the jp02 chameleon and the onespot
i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound
have been using these for years now
it also has a different size connector
so i gave this to him to save some time
works great with my new mixer
some may need a clamp
this is one awesome guitar
there is no onoff switch this really pissed me off
it works like a champ
great purchase especially if bought used
this mic is really nice
so you can wind and unwind
easy to adjust with reversible mallets
behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass
the stiffness is just due to preference
hosa products are a good bang for the buck
hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands
otherwise i really like this harmonica
i dont expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me
might even get a blue mic
other reveiwer complained of the excess space but thats what i wanted
we didnt really expect much except a quick way to record ideas
this are a great value for your buck
id allways come back to daddarios
the cushioning is nice and thick as well
the bass attack pedal did not disappoint
holds 810 picks depending on thickness
i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off
according to the ad copy this pedal replicates fullstack marshall crunch
despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use it
i love this little guy
i was not happy with the sound of these strings
the whole thing has a good weight
first i was fortunate enough to buy one for 300
very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime
aside from the passive electronics
i bought this not for the tuner but because i needed a metronome
single layer of fabric providing no protection
the plugs are also of the highest quality
it is accurate and easy to use
takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar
next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected
it also is bright and is very accurate
on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing
ive added a photo of my board
this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop
how do you get that much noise out of an 834 speaker
i guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy
the regular ts9 mode adds some low mids and a little more high mids
summaryif you arent using locking tuners youre wasting time when you restring
the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck
they recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge
this set is not for everyone
adds thick creamy distortion enhances harmonics and maintains great attack and definition
definitely not a flimsy stand
it sounds great for blues and rock
playing weekinds and practicing they last a long time with the same sound quality
addendum   i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributormanufacturer
what a great little gizmo
i am looking forward to using more of the effects
the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies
tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end
i would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar
purchased these for a new heritage h575 arch top
might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses
recommended to one and all
the review below is wrong
it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp
no complaints at all for the price
i wish it had a bit more gain
curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate
you can jam for hours with this thing its awesome
my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks
it costs 12 bucks great microphone for someone on a tight budget
there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market
perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do
i use it with audacity
this was a cheap capo but it does its job well
but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else
ill probably get used to it eventually
sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here
all in all a great capo that is well made and will last forever
the mustang iv is the same as the iii but with 150watts
this does work as described
i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
otherwise pick these up  great price and certainly gets the job done
the box already fell down 4 times i got small kids
these cant support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily
it also protected my mic in a fall once too
germany company manufacturing is in china
easy to use very tight and doesnt get in the way
by far the biggest change was the 34pointyness34 of the picks
you will pay up to 4x more for similar stands
the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest
you knew that when you bought it
music 123 is a musicians friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars
the mixer arrived early which was a lifesaver
guess thats why its so cheap
it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but
i dont have any real praise or complaints about this
a string winder and cutter
many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price
not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso
buy its bigger brother the us366
the unit is very heavy and rugged
but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell
i did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference
i will buy another one of this
free shipping for prime members
this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear
even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online
thats without the fuse software
i give them four stars
this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new
that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip
transparent in your signal chain when off as well
5 so what does it sound like
overall sounds and looks awesome
ill never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this
i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals
i have not experienced the tonesuck or buzzing that others have complained about
as long as you dont drop it all the time it should be ok
if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased
its supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasnt tilted back or fallen over
it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars
lack of a mid control
but oh boy i like it
i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment
its working for me ill be buying more for our studio
i decided to give it another 24 hours
but he has good taste
didnt look tapered to me and i cant use it
i would recommend these to anyone both experienced players and amateurs alike
i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel
exactly as described and very affortable
thing is great for multipedal use
i will be buying more of these
besides that ill more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers
just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water
it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect
i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around
at first it seems like it might be less accurate
plus its easy to see
if yours has this problem send it back while its still in warranty
in my opinion the ypg235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck
its definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this
this is a beautiful guitar
strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded
my acoustic guitars seem to like them too all except my 12string
both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks
its also very easy to install
for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect
pros  works really well and is easy to use
i didnt remember where id gotten it or even the manufacturer
i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings
they sound great for my style of play equipment and setup
latest review downgraded from 5 to 3 stars
the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments
i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily
i got the wrong size holder
you could also leave it attached to your camera
good buy for the price and nothing else is required
i tried airing it out for a week with no success
this is a fun and very good guitar for the money
get the 28 strand for a thicker snap
not here plenty of room for everything now
dual track with lowhigh volume sliders
for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules
i have always liked the planet waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy
the key to using this pedal is using it correctly
didnt test microphones yet but i think this is best price for 7 microphones
if i was really good i can see the need
for the price this lil guy does the job
first the bass e 11th string broke while tuning it up
everything about it is exactly how you would want it to be
certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily
mine lasted for a couple of weeks
i like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases
the sound is clear and warm on my yamaha and my martin
it picks up sound ok but not great
this is a nice strap
this a great instrument cable
it clips to my guitar strong and stays put
hopefully this review will be usefull to you
but hey they work so why change them
ive tried and replaced several
easy to use and perfect size
simple but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case
i use mine all the time between different alternative tunings
back plate has a greenish tint and is single ply not 3ply as advertised
most gig bags dont come with all these storage pockets
i have written other reviews about elixir
grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones
they also seem to make a good clean sound
so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over
think its bucker size upgradable top and bottom didnt measure i like single coils
only slightly better than 05
but ive used it and its easy
i would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap
these headphones are wonderful to wear
it is exactly what you need in a capo
does lengthen the strap a bit but works
this pedal in short sucks
i actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus
that said for the price it is pretty good
5 stars and a nobrainer
ive used ernie balls on electrics for even longer
very happy with my purchase
have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state
sounds like and plays like a les paul
the problem is its just not responsive enough
the dunlop does not have that feature
i use it on my taylor 910ce taylor 718e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
i found the mic tuner isnt as accurate
i will report on that
in comparison the shure clips are 14 in
these are miracle strings in my mind
crank this baby up and it moves air
you should have one of these in each gig bag
i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great
there is a problem with the design
pretty standard vs all other straps
anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all
it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly
but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less
if your budget is below that dont bother and save more
so not really a con
i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price
the good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them
good deal and i will purchase again
the photo shows no onoff switch however this does not catch any attention
this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read
saw this in tv yellow and had to have it
wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh
also theyre on the bottom end of the price range
its almost like having a new guitar
i store my picks in there and i put it by my table
he has been getting less callous on his fingers
i probably wont buy again for my other and future guitars
will review each one as they come in from amazon
almost no effect provided by pedal
love the case and shockmount being all inclusive
im not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should
a local store wants 2999 for one set of these
i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair
this amp really surprized me
it feels sturdy enough lightweight aluminum
just not a fan of the cheap shiny plastic versions
their microphones do a great job for little cost
the tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great
havent put a pad there or anything
its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it
i am able to adjust it to the length i play with
they sound awesome on my acoustic
but for the price you get what you pay for
does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick
some people rate this above the snark devices but i cannot
the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play
this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard
this seemed like the best option for that
it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen
i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned
currently the h2 is my backup unit
it comes with one free disintegrating pick
puts out pretty good power for a little 5w
wood finish is nice look on the wall
as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur
this one fills the bill pretty well
i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting
for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product
it fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle
a simple delay looper will suffice
the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear
overall i recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp
i bought it without hesitation
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
preamp power works well with condenser studio mikes
you start with 8 fxsubtract effect banks for
the curly cable has fared much better
from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only 40
there are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly
thats the problem with mail order
this microphones quality is amazing
easily worth the extra dollar
you cant go wrong with behringer pedals
if you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle
its a fine 34first34 guitar
there is no better modeling amp for my needs
i will still use a strap lock
took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye
but no issues besides that
i certainly recommend daddario nylon strings on classical guitars
its not very compact when folded but im still giving it 5 stars
the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still
if you are looking for a regularmedium string these are real nice
i did replace the strings shortly after getting it
this is just good common sense
based on those criteria the digitech cm2 is perfect
unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem
delivered in a timely manner
the strings are slightly smaller than the j74 and deliver a great sound
it supplies my microphones every time i run out
they are high quality great durablity and a great price
it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe
this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string
so i dont know if its a fair representation of these pedals
b  recorded dr40 printed to cd
i use p90 single coils on my godin lg and these strings sound great
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet
this stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way
i was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down
my son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings
the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are
light weight but holds a lot
i love this little device
very light very sturdy and at a low price
there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well
possiblyfaulty logic but i went with it at the time
for the money it does the job ok
they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings
no buzzes no hums no nonsense
it is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece
the first ukelele was a lanakai lu21
i have two and would buy again if i needed another one
cheap price and does the job
it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville 410fender mustang floorboard combination
this is not a wooly splattery vintage tone like the dunlop fuzz face
especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time
it worked just as it said it would
ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences
maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes
cant ask for more than that
sturdy with adequate padding to protect my 34babies34
for a ten spot ya cant do better
i love this new one
both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars
simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed
as with any pedal it wont make you a better player
anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good heres a few add ons in case
when you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost
works with my boss ds1 ac adapter too
ive used it to record my garage band shows
this is the only tuner you need
great price for good mike
this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way
this chorus is just about right
maybe its a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric
looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way
im a fender fan but this beats their single switch
i rehearse often with this thing
not much but a little
however buying behringer products always require crossing fingers and hope that they last
easy to pack easy on the instrument light weight but sturdy
over all for the cost you cant go wrong
unlike product photo and it doesnt match all my other gator bags
you really need a tuner for this step
and they dont move around so much like with the bigger triangle one
this clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use
spend the extra few bucks on these and smile
overall looks a nice piece especially for the cost
i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay
i havent used expensive rack units etc
you will not be disappointed
it cuts your changing time down drastically
not even holes for them
what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound
its marketed as an overdrivedistortion
the construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts
it is so accurate and works great so far
id definitely buy more cables of this brand
that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does
a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar
the plastic is thick and of a nice material
without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case
i like the ability to customize tension
nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends
should the need arise it is also easy to disassemble and assemble
i never had a problem with their stuff
i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill
this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without
but those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself
they have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity
pretty doesnt count for much with me
i have ordered several of these  like 6 or 7
this is a very good strap lock system
i like the look of it as well as the lightweight feel
a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also
power switch is on the back
this is a good looking strap
what about the stock pick guard
im an abhorrent violinist but i teach mariachi band to elementary school students
it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well
im sorry but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive
for the price you cant go wrong
cons   very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days
also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring  and inner
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
i dont think it would hold up long on stage at a venue
well built and looks even better in person than the picture
this is the first and only tc electronic product ive ever purchased
ive played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos
they are made well  last
i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly
dont forget to buy strap locks you will need it
i am enjoying this guitar
i am happy with the quality of all of them
so you cant use this as a clean boost pedal
it sounded just as good as those other amps
one was an ev and the other a rather costly older peavey
the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors
the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case
the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others
i usually buy the elizir but i thought id give these a try
anyway the bottom line is that daddario phosphor bronze are my go to string
best 12string capo i have ever usedand thats over decades
will probably have to manufacture something to replace it
the factory presets  61120 are not modifiable
it is of average quality but for the price i wasnt expecting much
quick to set up  tear down  adjust
want to get serious about a wah
applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets wipes right up
i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget
25th i think others have mentioned problems with pylepro audios customer service
i like the pick pocket too
and they produce no audible hum into the circuit
works wit all my guitars and for the price it is a steal
however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon
bass into one channel ipod into another headphones out
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
this little amp will sound great
we can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future
this is the best capo we have out of three
there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short
the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time
it holds where i left it over a year ago
it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well
a perfect match for the original i replaced
it does work but the stuff i used to have was much better
these make my cheap 50 acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my martin
very nice product great quality
awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced
you cant beat the price for such a great little tuner
i suspect most folks are in the same position
this really is a great deal
i just losen 6543 string and just put it in and it was over
what else is there to say
will not hold a blue yeti  yeti pro microphone
seems like it works just as described
you can count on me for future purchases
be advised though that it only registers natural notes and sharps
a great bargain for a very sturdy useful product
the muff is a lot more noisy
it works as well as other more expensive ones
old tech bungee type of capo
im looking to upgrade after a month
none of the problems onoff that plague the cry baby
but the arm is so fragile
the main issue is the sound
it drains batteries almost overnight
dont believe this is what it is meant for
im still in search of the perfect set of strings
if you are a bass player just buy it
its simple and works well
two disasters for classic rock music
it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties
other wise you are shifting the clean signal
this is a great quality microphone and at a good price
i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks
great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal
i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isnt my thing
great value and a great tool
dont use a bigger bit
im happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price
not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some
i dont like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes
if not break out your philips head  tweak your intonation
much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer
though it has no motorized faders it doesnt make my work uncomfortable at all
if it works correctly ill update this review after doing a few recordings
didnt have to install any kind of driver
if you need more than this i dont know what to tell ya
std power supply a plus
i dont and they arent for me
you also have to get ra taken altogether this makes it a deal breaker
but id expected more robust on your structure
i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review
it is a mandolin case
the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong
i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem
shouldnt they have a 599 one for 5string bass guitars
light takes up little space and easy to use
i also perform live in a cover band
i got the brady bunch musical here
the guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible and that means
the picture does not do it justice
simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band
shipping was fairly fast and its ready to use straight out of the package
not too difficult to get the hang of
overdrive that wont drive you over
great stuff to have for a great price8230i like it
i turn fx off and on
a much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers
i just cant trust it
almost compares to a monster cable
but the material is awesome
i did this for two days in a row
takes up less room on your pedal board
on no setting could i get rid of
would like to have a thinner one
i replaced a bone noncompensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this
great product would recommend to any guitar player
already ordered a different one to replace it
so i am not the authority
this pedal has an extremely high output
i ended up switching back to the 12ax7
the clear ring of the martins i normally use
any flaws would be quite noticeable
what else can be said that isnt implied in the title of this review
the shoulder strap makes me feel important
it works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes
some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges
it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really
this may not be so great for smaller amps
works right out of the box
3setup the intonation using a tuner
the only solid white leather strap i could find that didnt have any ornamentation
these are good picks and produce a great tone
i never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag
shipped free as an add on item at the time
the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny
works for a cheap bridge on my cheap stratocaster knockoff
it accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer
i got the package of two
i cant believe what you can get for the price on this one
facts is facts thats all
purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me
ive been sad ever since
no problems works great and doesnt tangle so it stores easily too
they still tune but i have to hold them against the guitar
when i got the strap i was impressed
the finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel
thanks for such a dependable product hosa
fits my behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine
other than that its fine and pretty well constructed
i only spent 859 for this and im mad at myself
other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends
my son plays electric and acoustic guitar
they are a little hard on batteries but not overly so
ive been playing for about 17 years
suggestion   find a wall stud and use 3 screws for heavier instruments
ive been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now
its a great idea but not well executed
this blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole
if you need a practice amp go with the jam
replace the tremelo arm with the one offered on amazon as well
i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is
i got it to have it if i needed it
many thanks and may your camels always have two humps
i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model and after only one week
i ordered these for my husband the guitar player
i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much
i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin
got it a while back but have just started to explore its capabilities
the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most
but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character
i have purchased six of these over the last couple years
it is extremely silent save any noise i would generate anyway from my rig
it came as well packed as a brandnew guitar and looks like one
overall this is a really good bargain for an extra backup or kids mic
man am i glad i did
recommended if you wantneed a nice little bag of fender mediums
i bought this becausehey a wireless mic for 13
i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out
overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume
i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect
although i should have just got the universal instrument tuner
i am glad i got the ds1 but for other reasons
if it only came in mink it would be perfect
i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time
pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit
and proceed to jam on maggot brain
good product and got good price here on amazon
it is as good looking in person as in the pictures
at this point im not even sure that i will use them
unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black
you dont have to worry about mixing up your strings
do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only
chances are its in working order no matter what
scratch free durable machine washable
quality product for a good price
some electric bassists still do this
there are a couple of annoying inconveniences
i have a few shure sm58s which cost more
at least these guys listen
the rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone
if you want to spice up your board go for some color
youre more apt to grab your axe and play more
otherwise great case highly recommended
easy to use  it is what it is
then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow
had to buy another one
ive never had any issues with this
i have very similer straps that have lasted 30 years
cool pedal on a clean amp
good bargain though for 699
strange for this particular usage scenario
dont last but a couple weeks
does the british sound succeed at that goal
the light should go out
i would buy this again
over the clean channel of the fender it sounds very full and smooth
anyway the attack on this pick is so just
i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly
i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection
so i figured what the heck
on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble
though be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software
gls is great quality and durable
the plugs are the standard screwdown type with well soldered  joints
it fits tight but its fine
on vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you
it uses a normal 9v adapter jack thank you finally
these daddario exl110 strings are light responsive and make my gibson guitar sound great
but for a small room its great
this is a great winder
you can get them for less than 3 per pack if you shop around
that is where an amplifier comes in handy
im a typical overweight american
mounting holes are drilled right screws pass right through and fit perfectly
this guitar stand does not find hidden treasure
there is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too
anyway through the gcs3 the fullbore basically sounds like a mesaboogie
zero hum or buzz from the unit
and the price aint so bad either
id order again if i needed another one
i sincerely like the concept
its really an excellent pedal
i can say that the brands8217 reputation carries over to bass8212these are phenomenal strings
this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables
getting he harmonica unto te springloaded holder can be a bit tricky
to me this was a worthless purchase
i could not ask for better for this price
if you place it on your music sheet stand thats great
i tried all three modes  carodid carodid  10bd pad and omni
but darn it this is one amazingly nice pedal when i consider price
this stuff is the best bargain on the market
the lead cuts clean 34mostly34
this is a great little uke for the money
it matches the mic well colorwise and fit
light weight allows you to remove quickly
the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth
easy to build and breaksdown for transport
cant b beat for the cost
overall a good buy for a backup strap or your primary
good quality for the price its a mic on a stand
i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar
the models of the vintage fender amps
they look nice and are easily worth their selling price
these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics
this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing
i had a friend with one of these and he loves it
not the most beautiful thing but worked
my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing
i look for guitar cables that will last
limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me
they are great strings on any guitar
they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine
anyway two thumbs way up for the uca222
stays in place and cannot slip out
if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is
it is so durable filled with options
plays 34dead34 meaning it will not stay intune
it was a good purchase
just squeeze and slide it where you need it
good thing i didnt trust the plastic anchors
these types of pedals are toys
i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek
this strap is pretty thin
the result was very sore fingers
matin coated are good too
but that is okay for practice and rehearsal
the color is sort of a metallic red almost candy apple red
spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks
at the most competitive price available
damn good for a bolt on
rogue g10 10w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing
the arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching
rubber washers come with to size for different necks
the product works as advertised and amazon has the best deal
if you play cw look no further
ive been playing guitar my entire life
if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up
i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great
amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students
for 7 dollars its a really good deal
this stuff will lube up your strings pretty well
yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect
the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light
very pleased with this purchase
no good out of the boxplug it nothing
regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book
roll of the dice i guess
there are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well
this item did the job its made for
flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster
used this to dress up the saga tele kit i bought on amazon
my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item
i highly recommend this guitar stand
it holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments
you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item
this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewines books and it works great
id use it for lightweight guitars
since i did not see similar comments from others perhaps mine is not representative
this has been very helpful for me to check finger position
id be lost without this tool
normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long
for the money this strap is as good as any other poly strap
im quite disappointed and it sits here with no use
the picks were exactly as described
it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument
for the money this ones a nobrainer
ive reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them
thats what you get with this
im sure the huge boss distortion box comes close but for the price
id recommend it over more expensive capos any day
its halpfull in stage because you dont need to test each string individually
if you are an angry stomper go elsewhere
no problem very standard one
what can you say about a pick
it fit my ibanez acoustic just fine
the davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control
but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me
perfect fit  they look great
giving these 3 stars is being generous
i also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big
its a decent tool at a good price so buy one
imho you dont need a click switch
as i get better i will upgrade
it is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream
88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues
i own 18 guitars 16 of which are electrics
none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string
i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul
made my little martin look almost as good as new
well made and a fair price too
cons i wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me
i consider it cheap insurance
i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this
i dont see this one wearing down anytime soon
sound was good and it was easy to set up
wide range to the tone controls
i do have my eye on a martin though
i use it put mh guitar and harp mic through the same rig
i dont think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold
these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass
average to 3 i guess
the name is somewhat misleading
i used it on a first act me501
i need some less expensive equipment to play on
holds your trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends
this is a great stand and highly adjustable
its very articulate and gives you good marshally 70s80s crunch
if its short of center the string is flat
they look nice and do the job perfectly well
the tone is much bettter too
love mine and have recommended to every musician i know
i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons
and it stays in tune nicely too
i like those better and theyre cheaper
id say the level is beginnerintro level sound and quality
i replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it
i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room
this is a great mic
no better and no worse
for classic rock  this is perfect
true meaning of the us dream
great guitar companies dont always make or sell under their aegis the best strings
good deal as backup capos
weve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job
this is a very good general purpose strap
its very heavy and seems sturdy and well built
i am still searching for the worlds perfect allpurpose pick
for the price it is hard to beat
these cans were decent back when they were just above 100 bucks
although the strap ends are light plastic theyve held up well
i have always found their quality to be very good for the price
i cant honestly say its a toy but it reeks beginner instrument
the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs
the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far
this case was not intended for the emperor ii
i been playing guitar for 12 years now
i use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there
that being said they also dont cost 70
ive been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far
this item was received well packed and on time
a needed accessory for any vocal recording period
i read great reviews here and the price seemed good
easy to get that last bit of fine tuning
i have very small hands so they work for me
installed on a tele i built
you just press the button and start plucking strings
i then let windows 7 plug  play the drivers no disk needed
its usb connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity
this particular unit seems to be built pretty well but time will tell
on the other side you cant use boost channel without drive channel
i used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show
consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision
it also has a worththepricealone space feature
by the way this unit comes with a 9v battery
i live on the 4th floor
its ok but not super tight
if it sounds too good to be true it usually is
the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced
a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less
does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound
if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles
these strings are great with my acousticshowever lately ive been using electric strings instead
i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand
its a good brand too
and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces
i lose them before they wear out
as far as quality these are great
the plastic housing might not standup to the road
this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used
the pedal comes with a 9 volt battery
bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law
somehow i had gravitated over to other brands including martin and daddario
i used to use those old stretchy things
so i must say im summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings
easy to read and for the very low price a great value
bought two of them about a year ago and im still happy with them
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new
this was a great choice and i couldnt be happier
highly recommended and 5 stars
so far very reliable after a few months of use
this cable arrived today and i am still in shock
not a lot to say works great as a shockmount
i would not recommend it
the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great
so i just got this product havent used it
if i change my mind about anything i will update my review
how did you test it
i used daddarios for many years
for anyone who plays acoustic guitar  these things are so handy
for 99 of situations these strap rocks
i tried this with regular guitar but its not the same
i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners
the construction is pretty basic
i like that its a bit larger than a 2021 soprano uke
im 511 i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still
cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster
according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well
it is made very nice
it just holds a guitar
this is a winwin buying decision as far as i am concerned
so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick
it was the right price for me right now
the bass sounds more like a real bass
the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark
runs on 2 aa batteries
my pet use to roam the car while driving
no complaints about this hardware
but it is a complete kit
i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows
it was also a tight fit
the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to 7
a tricky process at best
does what its supposed to do so far
spring for the extra bucks and be happy
they sure are portable though
like many i cannot afford a tube amp
their differences for your  ears
maybe adding something to keep it screwed in
i like the quality of the picks
this model has the cedar top
ive had this pedal since the mid90s when i started playing in my teens
the sn2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn1 doesnt
if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it
the tone isnt bad just not as good as a martin uncoated string
my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip
analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic
this is a great microphone
the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly
so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me
they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently
the buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install
i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively
ive had mine for over a year now
it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked
all the soft clipping is there for every nuance
this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps
this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle
it seems as accurate as my other tuners
you check the tuning and its tuned alright but why isnt it sounding right
the quality is great for me
in the mix it was more subtle
these are my goto acoustic strings
and i like the mother of pearl yahama inlay on the headstock
but for the price these are fine
true bypass and no hiss
i like a lot this pedal
i finally got it and saw how great it is
spend the extra 2 its well worth it
does its job just fine
great value and good sound
i would definitely recommend but its kind of expensive for what it is
i bought this for my acoustic
i was surprised at how small the jam is
if you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you
one day id try all 3 playing along with a cd
i just dont like the features of this stand at all
all the notesreeds sounded good
the guitar stays in tune while playing
fast forward a few years and i purchase this little baby on a whim
this is a good stand
it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget
its chromatic so it will tune anything
the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing
no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning
every bass player should have one of these
its a little stiff and im sure it will soften up upon more use
might be a little old fashioned but
do not let the size of this little amp fool you
this is a great item
unlike the edirol the h2 comes with a simple stand
it would be hard to beat
many adjustments to get just the right position
help my vocal mics last longer so singers dont drool on my mics
constructed well works perfectly rolls up nicely with no kinks
like many have mentioned this pedal is like a ts but without the midhump
finally do not drop these
they last a long time
this cuts strings with no problems
apparently they arent easy to make
unit works fine with my digital piano
however ive been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca
i would not hesitate to buy them again
and it works very nicely with the dunlop dual design straplok system
put our hangers in studs but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall
but it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase
simply these are great cables
its heavy enough that it doesnt flex unnecessarily
i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained
imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability
duncan type often suffer from nonpositive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed
tune my mandolin and banjo with it
this is because prior to the mid40smost strings were made of nickel
you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud
the range of thicknesses generally works well and daddarios tend to be pretty consistent
it wont budge once you clip it and its low profile
used this for more than a year and finally sold it
second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser
i am impressed how well this works
if high gain is what your after then stay away
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it
good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind
i was lucky enough to get my hands on one early
all the metal parts look sturdy and durable
was really impressed to see it in action
im happy with this pickup
for a while i had the sn5 tuner
you can read my verypositive review on the epiphone on amazon
a bit annoying but not the slides fault i guess
i should have totally returned this product
it is what i expected it to be
its tri pack with great quality strings on good deal
i ordered this hard case for my fender t bucket
cons  built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped
the input signal is cleanly boosted
id buy it again but they should really include a washer
i love the quality and the sound
i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night
cleans up your gears appearance tremendously
thats why its so inexpensive
they dont taste like grapes however
finally i gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely
of course that could just be my expectations
i give them a thumbs up
and screamythe fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes
low settings not too echoey more like a bassd out reverb
i bought this case for my rogue astyle electric mandolin
i use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome
i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii
my music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much
i still cant get over the fact that it is a 40w amp
there is no click assuring that the cable is in place
they did what i expected them to do
i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises
theres no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing
this works well with the mandolin
the streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical
hey its a pick its 10 to a bag
its choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me
if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one
never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear
it sounds really good on my classical guitar
heres the thing i am an amateur
have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time
lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months
its better because it cleans all 6 at once
the feedback can be to to many other issues
its those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china
i can give these away to beginners that dont have a capo
the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head
overall i would buy again
it sounds just like i hear on tv and it sounds great
cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine
they sound much better and arent quite as loud
works well tunes tight and is cheap
the string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly
other than the radio part
its a tight fitting case
i finally purchased an ebow about a year  ago
i put these suckers on there and wow was i impressed
i prefer that the rings all be brass one color
i no longer lose or misplace my picks
even the packaging it cool
there is plenty of room for all my needed connections
i have a pigtronix philosophers tone  it made a big differrence
what this tuner has  accuracy usability durability versatility
you get what you pay for in this case
this guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money
would like different holiday designs like this
they stay in tune very nicely
these strings honestly arent for rhythm
recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all
the strings were easy to work with on installation
spend more money get some quality mics
its also easy to use
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months
easy to hold on to
seems very durable switch and jacks are quality
for an 8 item you cant go wrong
had one pick inside as a place holder
i also like the xlr connectors on these havent had one go bad yet
let me say three feet is short very short
does what it was intended to do
if you get these and they arent perfect
5 stars just for service
the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference
reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some
however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible
but 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck
it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars
happy to have black connectors on an xlr cable that doesnt cost a ton
a little goes a long way
great product and extremely affordable
cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft
mine initially came with middle position
im on the fence with this product
this makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price
at least i dont want to
34 all of my other cables work with my geetar
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback
i would recommend it to anyone
the exps are nice strings
so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles
this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion
time to open another carlsberg cheers fender
i like that this is fairly light
just put a good analog fuzz after it  youre good to go
provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volumewah pedal that works great
it does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005
still for the money a great buy
i bought 2 of these as controllers for my alesis drum machine
easily fits in my ukulele case too
its a really great quality stand for the price
for blues jazz or light rock its brilliant right out of the box
the strap would constantly fall off
for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat
it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces
if you are picky these are all eye candy
works very well and is portable
all in all it was worth the money
man what a great sound
id seen this one on youtube and thought its little bobble head looked
i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks
recieved set of two stands with case promptly and in perfect condition
these strings are very bright and full
my transmitter pack slid on with ease and i was ready to go
it does what it should
when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also
it really has its own thing going on
thats part of the fun of tubebased od
tung sol knows how to do it
nothing special just the will to get used to it
excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right
theyre 2 days on and sound fantastic already
however this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion
there are two ways guitar strings go bad
these mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response
look the product may be good or not
seems well made for the price and works as advertised
the keys are 85 of standard width which is large enough for fumblefree playing
are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals
but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem
i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks
also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me
i highly recommend digi stuff
my guitar room isnt super bright and its very difficult to read
its quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily
easy to read easy to use
this amp is perfect for that
they are comfortable but not as comfortable as id like
the pdc21 is a nofrills device
almost sounds like a bad recording
use this for my desk mic at home
are usually north of 200 which isnt practical for a casual player
it fits snugly but well
theres not much to say about this pick
i like it with the power supplyno batteries to fuss with
if looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further
this is a hitormiss product
however i like the look of sm58 and it seems to be extremely durable
i use it for both bass and guitar and it processes the signals well
the sound is lets say
i have them on all my guitars
except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels
double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would
it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room
if you want really good quality buy the boss unit
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other two
this holds guitars very well
the case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets
do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings
all of that said the strings are pure joy to play
depends on what you want
it alows you to fine tune each string
instability incompatability and frustration abound with audio interfaces
i would highly recommend this and give it a nobrainer 5 star rating
the percussion loops are fine  at least provide solid guides for recording
if you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases
and it did the same with a usb phone
overall a good value for the low cost of this unit
i would highly recommend this pedal
i like the grippiness of them
if you like muffs youll really like this one
if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you
what do you say about a little chip of celluloid
if oxidationwear is an issue switchcraft makes goldplated jacks
this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar
none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall which is good right
the amp simulation is top notch
these are working a lot better for me
this is a great complement to study theory
sorry  i had rather not comment until it is used
definitely recommend this slide especially for its price
it has its own level btw
jcm800 in a 30 dollar box
just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection
good investment for the price
the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well  it delivers massive fuzzplussustain
these work better for me than any others ive tried
the effects are beautifully done
the unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature which i leave on
when i am plugged in i dont move around a lot
you can get pretty decent sound out of this
problem solved quickly and elegantly
decent cables and arent too expensive
of course this would not result in 20 feet when its stretched
even my digitech rp255 has a built in 24bit audio interface
this is the only string ive ever used that has all of those qualities
it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals
incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it
i might try it somewhere on the strap
if youre a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing
ive heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why
it has a bit different sound obtained when i use this one
tiny and seems to be accurate
also the xlr connectors are of the highest quality
no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in
changing strings on a 12 string less often
this tuner really delivers its inexpensive and accurate  much better than the sn1
ive used both the es57 and es58 for several years now
the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leatherlike material
very beatiful and good quality
my wife made me try this for a gig we had
i like this better than my old snark
my son loves them both
the strap is comfortable and adjustable
this is a good budget uke
the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic
i am confused by this hellish portal of confusion
the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion
one gets in the way of the other
its heavy weight solid construction and very stable
reality  lets say the stand held onto the guitar
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
i switch acoustic strings 34 times a month on my 2 main guitars
this is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes
this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded
these things are great and yes i can shred faster now
edit  the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle
the pockets are very handy
ive been a musician for over 40 years
forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one
this is incredibly easy to use right out of the package
i used this on my last stratocaster build
mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence
has a very solid base
hands down the best cable i have ever owned
but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume
keeps wireless unit very snug and tight
this one is the best ive tried so far
theres a slight hiss too
ive been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems
very good idea and holds it perfectly
i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar
im very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job
i have used that other sbrand on other instruments and really prefer the dunlops
as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same
i use it to wind my strings
i wouldnt trust this strap without a strap lock
these pedals last forever and i only paid 20 for mine
product is a solid build and prices right
easy to adjust to very light on my fingers and theyre built to last
they sound clean and crisp
it is a simple compressor thats it
you can buy with confidence
that would have been perfect
but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package
digital delays were clear sounding but
i thought they would be the same but they were not
the output impedance is less than 10 ohmsrespectable but not amazing
this pedal completed that task
it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty
at lt20 this is a great bargain but it is a very basic bag
excellent product at a righteous price
the sound quality is amazing
great price at amazon as usual
ill post up a picture later
it is really the best pick holder i ever had
promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure57 stays in one place
amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs
my studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs
that is good and seems to hold up to use
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this 34leaning stuff
i dont think you will be dissappointed
the great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost
gotta keep it simple on this review because its a simple item
i tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both
italian made need i say more
it is my tuner of choice right now
wow is what my teenage son said when he opened this on christmas morning
and the fender frontman  not even in the ballpark
goes well with my black squier strat
there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case
but either way i liked it and decided to keep it
easy to use and the clip is sturdy
i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up
do you even remember why you picked the style you use
would buy again should the need arise
this thing really wants to sing to you
it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make
having played guitar for 45 years i have tried and used many many capos
it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones
this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it
when they say small they mean small
same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor
it gives just the right amount of crunch when needed
i got this for 150 dollars when it was on sale
texture is very nice doesnt slip
but it sounds great to me
if your household is quiet this is very much a good bargain
great price and well made
other than that its great
free shipping via amazon prime
i tried this but ended up going back to tortex
it works for a metallica pantera type sound
it lasts a pretty long while too
give these a try and let me know what you think
just what id expect from the company
ive had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing
i dont see how it could be better
so the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight grayblack
based on other reviews i made my purchase
i love these dunlop capos
i think ive found how lazy i am
hundreds of sounds to choose from
until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency
easy on my fingers too
the picks go in and come out nicely
i havent gotten that far yet
it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar
the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension
this guitar cable is very nice
the ends are leather sewn onto the strap
swivel head for ease of viewing the screen
what makes a good cable
want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay
true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound
same basic materials you cant go wrong with either
guess i am not a gimmick person
all of my 734 tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits
these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune
bottom line this is a nobrainer
ive tried the fishman ft1 and the tune tech ttm201
first of all its huge
ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends
i ordered two pdmic58s and they came with an xlr to 14 cable included
it sounds like a cheap mic
contrary to the name it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer
it took me two hours to get it all working
i plan on getting a few more of these
there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i dont blame the device
just too digital and uninspiring
i was very disappointed when i tried this thing
i play and practice a lot and i abuse strings
as ive said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing
im partial to the chorus
the added features are also a plus
its a nice little tuner and my guitar is sounding great
it does whats its suppose to do
i love their flexibility options for colors and ends build quality and price
its just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals
octave  bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers
i can afford to pay twice as much
i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great
its cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well
works well withdunlop dual design straplok system blacktoo
this the second set of strap locks that ive owned
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
some guitars sound best with phosphor bronze
ive read its not really complete isolated but it does the job
so all said i still prefer my kyser
i use carbon zinc batteries in mine
not noisy at all so fits in with other pedals on your board great
i have no plans of changing brands now ive made the string switch
i had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short
fender truly went to 11 on this one
fortunately ive another plus a korg and an two intellitouch
easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in
feels nice and is very light
it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot
ive been playing for 29 years and i highly recommend joyo pedals
going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones
the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down
i have been playing guitar for over 30 years
for kicks try it out with some distortion andor overdrive and a wah
otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great
it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop
i stuck some repurposed rubber feet on the bottom
it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc
overall im happy with my choice
the strap i got was a levys with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable
simple and easy to use easy to carry around
so in the end 45 stars
we try to stay stocked in these picks
i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade
but with every positive theres usually a negative
and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway
these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better
it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos
the two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable
they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably
these are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session
i got this on sale from gc for 80 shipped plus 7 tax arrrgh
one wouldnt fit in my soundboard another wouldnt lock in my mic
sent it back and did not reorder
heres what i noticed  the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range
i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot
thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine
there are many clipon tuners but i liked the following about this tuner 1
these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable
they are wellshielded look nice and handle well
its no better or worse than a tripod stand at twice the cost
also does make the neck a lot smoother
sorry folks but id skip this one
its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for
i may buy some more of them
edit  im nothing if not fair
theres nothing not to like about this capo
affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchase
whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar
i do like these picks too
this unit is like a old blue jeans
vibe is very trower like
no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings
ive been using only kyser capos for many years now
inbetween the lights and mediums
in that environment i thought it a nice instrument
these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads
any lower and it is a steal
a function i absolutely love
i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele
i bought this to go with my shure sm58s
one customer said it did but mine did not
the cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups
however since i love my guitar i use it anyway
this music light has one drawback it doesnt have a master switch
bb is displayed as a
you really will not be disappointed with these
i know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile
they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect
this is a great capo from shubb
really easy to use and well built
they couldve make it a little bigger
they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff
i always seem to have to retune with the spring loaded capos
there are no frills and theres no latency
overall this is a definite buy
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips
all 5 star reviews on this baby
i use clayton 126mm picks a heavy pick but certainly not oversized
the built in shock mount is definitely a plus
if you like warm old school tones youll dig this pedal
it has worked so far
this mic gives a great range of recording purposes
this is a great product that does what it says
the handle extreamly soft to the touch
its no peavey but it works just as good
this guitar just got stolen from me
and has 2 nice leds
you can hear the difference once it is used
its small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk
its very rare thing to see now a days
but i cant recommend this product
that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp
been playing for 30 years and i have used tube screamers extensively
the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand
my upgrades if any will be new pots caps wiring nut perhaps tuners
feels sturdy enough and its adjustable for a man of any size
a rat is a rat whether theyre coming from china or the usa
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
but that costs 2x or more as much
it has low noise clean soundgood transmission
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii
but after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video i finally broke down
nothing but praise goes to the supplier  kdm distributors
i like the sound of this pedal
they all work well are well constructed and are a good value
it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation
i tried them but didnt like them
but all i bought it for was the purpose of tuning mission accomplished
i bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case
the only thing the other has on this one is its size
you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low
added november 8 i put the star back
the 1253mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers
i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around
it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension
it can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion
never had one bad set out of over a hundred
my guitar is absolutely beautiful
may not for very big guitar neck
just make it one solid piece
the tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine thats a pleasure to use
i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for 60 more
that being said this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi
i have a les paulmarshall class 5bb preampep boosteranalog chorus and carbon copy
i cannot begin to tell you how much i love this guitar
havent played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes
sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement
i am glad i didnt break budget here
it holds all my acoustics perfectly
and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
i received my cables very fast
i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they dont disappoint
im enjoying using this pricedright set of strings
i am very pleased with my frontman 25r
the software installation is optional
then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case
tc just does things right
this took a little getting used to but it does work very well
weight is pleasantly light and the semigloss finish is comfortable to the touch
the snake took its place
on stage has a well built unit here
i find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber
the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
lunar lander here we come this pedal will take your playing to the moon
foldsup pretty compact for travel
the great features are 1
i guess you get what you pay for here
i think this monster cable sounds fine
i could not believe it
225 at gc for example
i have one of these in every one of my cases
update  been using these picks for a year since my first review
you wont have difficulties to plug your pedals
its a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle
let me start by saying
not much to say here
no reason i cant make something like that on my own though
may order more as extras
mine wasnt that cracked and it worked great
i tweaked the action and the 010s are fine and ive made the adjustment
best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp
it is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this
not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument
sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can
you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch
the tails tend to have a little unnatural decay or something
i enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars
i highly recommend purchasing one
from aint talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the 80s
this made actuating it a less natural motion
like it even if its a bit long for use at home
but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation
not much else to say it works and looks well made
but it works fine for me
easy to install with patience easy to use
the top part is not secured
very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful
these are good strings but not 5 stars good
after the guitar gets hydrated
they attach to the wall with 2 screws
it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too
the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy
its strong and durable and well designed
i was definitely not disappointed
i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects
i can do a string changeover in about 15 minutes on a bad day
thats all i want from replacment parts
i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason
i prefer a string with a little more volume
this mighty bright is  great
im very happy with the purchase and the price was right
i am now 57 so i have a few years of experience
other than that its a great device
this is a good quality strap
i am working on getting that nice way sound which ive come across somewhat
thats another amp i was considering
amazoncom did a great job too getting this out to me
the 2 important things are not in bullet  the sustain and the sound
this amp out does my old roland cube 60
i had to get used to this tuner at first
they do what they are suppose to do and do it well
i was surprised at how comfy it was at the price
this is too loud for most apt
if you dont your guitar will hang a bit cockeyed
you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box
fits a standard xstand just fine and makes a very secure connection
i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time
i dont know how long it will last
it does not stick on to the guitar very well
this is i think based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal
they dont sound overdriven they just sound distorted
would definitely purchase it again
not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip
but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box
alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flatpick drag
could not get to fit small sound hole
i cant wait to get it through my other amps
it is small enough to be out of the way while playing
i like that its adjustable to various heights
i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download
i started getting nice compliments about the guitar
ive wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently
cant beat the price either
all switches knobs plugs  display work fine
they give them that extra twang
good idea to keep more than one of these around
you might even become the next joe satriani
controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on
fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare
if you cant afford a better guitar may be worth a try
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue
and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul
great product and great value
but its a fine guitar
the amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 watts
seen these and they work great when needed
it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design
i have since gone back to delrin and nylon
i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar
the little knob on them made it very hard to install
you dont plan to adjust it much and3
i have no complains about it
but for the price its not too bad
im new to electric but my les paul does change tunes
great bang for the buck clone of a tech 21 gt2
tends to slip on the strings however
surprised there are so few reviews
this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words
by that time half the youtube video was over
i use mixcraft pro 6 and its working well
while it isnt it the prettiest guitar out there its by no means ugly
these will give any quitar a beautiful voice
nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago
great value for the price
the latest one has a very mellow amber color led
i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues
monster knows it all in quality
remove these rubber 34nonskid34 plates because they come off too easily
now for some down sides
he says its easy to use and is durable
one thing thats less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself
and expect to get it the price was half of what i was locally
work perfectly with my guitar good price
nice lookingnice sound and quality to these cables
i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine
i may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic
you will not want to go back to any other set of strings
with guitars crappy strings kill it
i do like these strings
however this product is wonderful
id love two more ports
hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro
its just ridiculous what is in this for 199
after 2 weeks im still loving the guitar
turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean
the experience for me has been pure jamming joy
these are solid stands for holding your guitars
thats not bad in itself
i like these even better than the martin custom lights
i must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too
this tape will definitely fill the requirement
this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea
cant really compare to the others but for me worth the price
i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics
i may tease and say its and award or art piece
what else is there to say
these people just do not know how to read
stock this tuner was awful
as for the sound  the pedal sounds great
the yeti sounds as good
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs
i would call the black ice picks medium sized
greatly improved the tone over the stock sovteks that where in there originally
my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks
but daddario pbs are a great place to start
as the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all
there are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that
plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking
its especially perfect for garage and bar bands
i used this on noisy hinges car doors etc
it was a pain to take out too
i have done it for you
the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble
stop looking and buy one
but i do feel confident in what i report here
the metronome has a flashing light too
tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice
i was miserable my guitar sounded like s
works well even with a room full of noise
price cant be beat either
they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced
the included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes
there are something special about these strings
i have several and a snark for each one
the colors are nice as well
also picks up noise from your movements
overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is bluesoriented
ive had a few of these things not all the same model
whatever the name this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp
dont buy those other picks buy these because tortex
as of now i hardly use them at all
the hall setting is wonderful
this isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what youre getting
what would that equate to  in hours
and that makes me want to play twice as long
they are solid look good and feel good
either they kind of 34disappear34 when youre playing or they feel like a hindrance
maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable
it took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions
im very pleased with this purchase
put these on my gl s500 electric
if i could make one i would
the strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what i needed
i wanted mymxl 2010 multipattern studio micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it
the build quality is solid  it feels like a much more expensive amp
but the dunlop is better to me
always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm
does all i need it to do
i tried it on the boom arm and it made it topheavy and unstable
i pushed the stand and
well i found out he uses a 990 as well
i like to use different gage picks therefore
ill be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s
its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark
looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand
just was not what i was hoping for
the downside is it is not granular enough to say intonate an instruments bridge
but seriously that little paper wouldnt kill anybody
i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it
i probably have around twelve of them
these picks are kind of thin flexible and have a good rubber grip
purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home
it appears to be well made and durable
im going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light
i would rather concentrate on making music
it worked didnt arrive dead
heavy to travel with also so i dont know how much ill use it
this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap
if youre considering it buy it
this is definately worth the money
my how things change when you can see what is really going on
plus the added gag of tiny ukulele  tiny amp always draws a laugh
i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter
i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy
i have the snark 2 but read that this was the best so far
the rubber housing is an excellent idea
boss dd7 beats the pants off the line 6 echo park delay
great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless
this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners
but this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls
the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think 34perfect34
if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound
that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better
i know it will live up to the finder name
they just seem to sound better to my ears
i wanted to experiment with this item
same manufacturer but different models
i got this for use with the boss dd20 as a taptempo
definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it
with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff
buy one  youll like it
looks great really classes it up in my opinion
the pedal is everything i expected from it
it is built like a baton
nice solid construction and vibration mount included
you can plug it into the pc and customize everything
the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest
who uses flexible mic clips
i like using this clean
i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately
the are the same as came on my guitar
but most on these things leak anyway
these balanced patch cables are great
soooo its pretty much useless to me
it is worth the money in my opinion
this was my 1st decent classical guitar
it comes with a key so you can lock it
because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs
but i only use the tortex pics
as far as i can tell they are all the same widththickness
made in germanyquality musical instrumentnot a toy
have used them for months with no failures
would recommend to any level of guitar player
im quite pleased with this speaker
for the price i was really happy with it
i will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables
when playing at home ill use the more gentle schubb
the string does not corroded but i changed mine anyway
having to look at the beating heart while you play is very difficult
after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was
the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad
the display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate
set echo for multiple head repeats
i dont think the actual 14 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks
but i like the build quality and the speed control
this is not the case
no i would not take it on tour
i dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine
when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune
no more dead 9v batteries
worth every penny and then some
i currenty use two types of capos  the kyser one and shubb capos
had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened
your used to using big picks which strum hard easily
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
the other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear
all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
but this pedal gives me everything that i want
intuitive and the backlit screen is so easy to see
this makes the guitar sound huge
i will probably buy a couple more of these
my first wah was a morley steve vai bad horsie
if you need an overall great set of strings get these
five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs 12 shipped
4 the case is made of metal
ps  i have the russian variant
the quality is great for the money
i would not advise anybody to get this
this mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar amps
at the current price at the time of this review its a bargain
thats quite shocking considering how long the usb 20 standard has been around
the 1w setting is perfect for my studio and the
more for the intermediate musician
this is a great guitar case and a great price
generally dampits can be used over and over for years
two downsides both are about the noise
these sound great and last a long time for me
needed patch cables for my pedal board
it worked great then one night again i couldnt hear myself recording
whats even better is how long they last
still it packs a punch
the depth knob does its job
good little stand to hold your guitars
love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks
it does what it is intended to do holds my picks
the unit is simple to use and the builtin microphones do a great job
these strings are not overhyped
great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price
definitely the best looper ive come across
its for bedroom use only
i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value
the pickup adds a bright clear sound to your instrument without feedback or hassle
it picks up anything it is attached to
60s ive been using them for years and so will probably never change
he liked the result when i switched out the gt 12ax7
ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day
not that its a surprise though
snark tuners are the best
like the title says the timeless combo of neutrik  mogami is better
this capo is small looks good and works very well
nice tone and good quality
just like the ones in the store
i ordered this for my jackson dkmg
i like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it
i cant think of any other pedals ive owned that could do this
when i tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent
i bought this as a second tuner for gigs
the oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl
i love the flat low profile right angle plugs
this is not my only capo but its my cheapest
first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying
not the cheapest but worth the money
i wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference
another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves
this gets the track started before it clears it
it works and like it says it reduces the noise
works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help
i use this all the time
well i didnt expect much due to the price
simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding
this seems like a good product
either way i am happy with them
there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop
the nonslip surface doesnt take long to wear off but i have a workaround
somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom
it will clip on anything you want to hold it
if amazon used halfstars i would have given them 355
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
i bought an ibanez concert size uke
hey r ford uses them
these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality
one last thing  youve gotta love amazon
ive noticed it works better with some daws than others also
ill bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out
playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever
worth a shot if youre on a budget like me
i dont notice any difference in audio or loss in sound
practical useful for drum kit
i have tried many types of steel strings
this harpbb has a beautiful tone
for the price they are awesome strings
you have to get this cap on just right or the strings will buzz
of course the durability is still in question at this point
so ill try to give you the information you need to make your purchase
some people complain about the smell
and before you ask 34is it perhaps your output jack
they appear to be very well built and sound just fine
nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle
both harps very bendable etc
actual description is a blasted 34design34 which is what you get
at the end im satisfied with the 2035
basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion
clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price
i just might buy another 3pack
for this much i have no complaints
i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f335 and they look stunning
just two controls one for volume one for compression
my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit
has a black finish on it
i can report that i have been very comfortable for long practice sessions
plugged it in worked first time no problems
i had other cables on my pedal boards
so looking around on amazon i found this handy little device
however ive used one of these boards before
this one really fits my taste
thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt
this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick
i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at homeand this works great
i wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar
itll do for setup work and the price is right
i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has
these arent too heavy not too light
since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings
i love them on my strats
who cares if it is plastic
like all of dunlop products this worked great
its sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works
highly recommend for budget tuner
it is the best playing best sounding 12 string i have ever played period
jj seems to have a smoother sound than most
best money i ever spent
solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag
so i figured an experiment was in order
i have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them
it sturdy and good quality
these strings are really nice
even when at low volume its tones will fill a room
the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects
it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box
fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners
this guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars
but these are just wish list items
in fact its about time to order another set or three
i ended up putting the screws back in
all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly
all connections are 14 mono
it fits my need for practicing
its fast and easy to use
the latest 34bargain basement34 squier strat bullet is no exception
that didnt come close to working
the lows sound present and clear
so for the price these are an excellent value
its different sounding from the crybaby wah
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
this is definitely a high quality cable
add to this 16 digital presets
who said learning the guitar was difficult
after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great
thinking about buying another one
the look and feel of this cable is excellent
packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use
other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this
ill use the case for my higher end hohners as needed
they also seem to be quality without bulky
the 10 pack price is amazing
mic stands can be a hassle sometimes
i wouldnt touch anything but fender mediums for years and years
books under the head stock
i have bought three of these
unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this
i usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days
the rubber wont hurt your violin bridge or strings
the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween
sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value
i leave it on my guitar all the time
i cant say much about this product
this microphone only has a usb port
its possible that i just lucked out with a good one
only used it a couple times so far but i like it
like i stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality
and its not that im cheap either
theyre great for metal if you like a durable pick
and the pick holder is a nice touch but
its eco friendly and nicely packaged
to conclude would i recommend these
nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively
mostlly notnecessary for me but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too
they hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style
for the price very hard to beat this
looks better than the plain one
you have to be committed to dealy
after 40plus years of playing daddario rocks
for the price this is the perfect pop filter
the sound quality is great
the 65 twin reverb on the orange level is by far my favorite
ease of use is tops ever
i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics
this is my third purchase of this tuner
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
everything i wanted and more
this is not just a tuner  its a peacekeeper for our band
ive played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever
and the price is right
a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar
only time will tell how well the soldering is
and yes this pedal will do that
there is also an embossed model brown offered at minimumly higher price
al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto
im not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish
dont get me wrong though i still like these
a drop of wood glue fixed it
there are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds
great grip slow wearing and they dont break
i am running a dj karaoke system
save your money and time
to let you know what i need in an interface 1
after shielding it is absolutely quiet
stick tape holds it anywhere you want it
i highly recommend this product
behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most
but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings
bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal
the pick pocket is a nice extra
right out of the box
july 20 2012 just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat
not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place
this is a great program for nondrumming one man bands like me
the price is right and they keep them safely stored
some things are great values others are cheap
wow these are some good sounding strings
however the ibanez ts9dx does more than your typical tube screamer
bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube
great gig bag for acoustic guitar
we got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar
good price and it arrived quickly as well
this thing stands up nicely on all three
there are gig bags and there are gig bags
i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery
these things grab the mic and wont let go
i really like this cable
but like i said it good for the price
im having so much fun with it
its much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables
i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great
great product for a great price
only with your guitar volume knob
fails with a 13082 googled the problem
sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications
the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup
the front metallooking grill is mesh but quality and looks great
i was not happy the super champ x2 didnt come with it
great little amp but get a tube amp if youre serious about playing guitar
going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate
worth the money great product
i got mine from musicians friend
maybe try those but im sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops
60mm for a more raw folk like sound
i had to unplugplug maneuver into place
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
i used it and i like it
i think the main difference is the actual weight or mass
ps i use it for my base though satisfied
all and all for the price its a 5 star
the monitor is powered so theres a power cable as well
i hate overprocessed guitar tones
i bought this guitar in 2005
recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges
these do definitely have more output
behringer makes great products at incomparable prices
this speaker has a very clear full range sound
it kept opening up even without a mic on it
i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isnt one of them
it has always worked well for me
that sort of irked me
it is too long and will likely split your neck
now after a couple of months i want to say
i think its time to sell them off
but at this time i am not sure i like what i have done
they are good quality screws
i have yet to decode their colors or naming system
i do a single duo and full band
i can fit all of my 34stuff34 into the many pockets as well
play with the round side for a fat tone
these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise
it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box
order extra to keep on hand
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound
for me not so easy to get beyond the basics
this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product
most of my cables are from planet waves and ive never had an issue
great buy cant go wrong here
i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch
they just are not the sound i was looking for
it looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas
and holds all strings down completely and easily
see my review on the music stand
only two things to gripe with  1
i purchased this for my 10 year old daughter
88 mm picks for that
electric thin neck vs thick etc easily
they dont squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool
didnt want to spend 150 for a reverb so gave this a try
clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone
this guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck
one cannot go without having one for the price
for a regular venue i have an extra marshall 500watt speaker system
this is my first strobe tuner
i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand
and i like those strings better
especially for the 100 tag on it
from the looks of it it complements the instrument well
this capo seems to handle quite nicely
update   i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx 802
my little  vht special 6 came alive with this speaker
well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars
this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action
using it couldnt be simpler and it has excellent contrast
nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well
it works on steel strings
like most line 6 products some features are not highly apparent
the base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly
i bought my spyder jam back in 2009 when it was fairly new
i go through these quite a bot but for 2030 you cant go wrong
this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke
i have been playing guitar offon for about 30 years
thats just not what it was intended to do
lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark
at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price
this cord is too flimsy
are they better than the 100s
my favorite is the 070mm
i should have bought another one of these instead
its literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand
planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff
olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls
its finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head
this stuff honestly works very well
finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it
so i took a chance on this little stompbox from china
this is what i have needed for many years
i feel it sounds really good and has many settings
10s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup
they still work years later
these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are
this one works better than the smaller rubber ones
still a relatively short amount of time
looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst
they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick
one is for my ibanez ak75g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly
it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet
i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine
delay on tuning low e string2
the really important difference is the 34tuning mode34 feature on the hola
i believe it has accomplished that well
great buy prompt shipping great product
i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good
a little pricey but probably worth it
i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar
this microphone works well for our needs
one is the stock reverb
i have several behringer pedals and other behringer equipment
you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard
so i took one star away because of this problematic issue
treat it gently and it will last forever
your hand floats over the frets
if using usb does not need external power supply
easy to grip and are pretty quite
the sound i get with it is very very cool
however thats me and ymmv as they say on the internet
sorry os2  its pawnshop time for you
clips on easily and hold strings down nicely
this eq achieves almost the same results and i paid less
he loved them all and wont quit playing with them
strong as a tiger tank
just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it
i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume
i bought these because they were an 34addon34 offer and im glad i did
these seem very well made
you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it
they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had
thats to be expected in a passive di box and it doesnt bother me
im glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them
this is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times
i have two of these for my acoustics and when i get another acoustic
i have a 13 gooseneck a light condenser mic and small shockmount on it
great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these
and this one fit the bill
its price is attractive as well
i use this when i broadcast from streetjellycom
amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too
maybe if youre using this to run a pa i would recommend it
he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny
solution  hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive
i am not a slap style player so i cant comment on that
this bag fits my epiphone les paul ii electric guitar very well
it does everything the product description tells you about
other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine
its a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny
way more versatile than any other muff
great price for the quantity
there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal
nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb
daddario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time
overall i like it and i would recommend it
but however you use it it is sweet
this is a clean simple amp to use
its very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without
i dont know what i was expecting
affordable technology in the service of great art
weve been only using it for two days and so far so good
this is one lush pedal and its all analog
the top gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well
i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm
i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp
at least its long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures
fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short
this was a good purchase
i recommend this to all musicians
you really cant go wrong
i wrote a least three times and got no response so far
they are not expensive to replace
so this one works well for the price
true bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are good
expansion kit from what ive seen
not your fender quality strap
and the result sounds really right
quality and value all the way
i had the red snark and a couple others
i knew i had found 34my strings34 after a short time playing with these
i own at least 8 of these
the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly
you need a boom stand
behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this
my frist guitar strap i like it alot
these cables are very good quality
if you hear hum its not the shielding its your technique
the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box
i now know what i was missing all those years of not having one
they will sound great for the life of the string
elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price
i do dabble with the bass but im not proficient with it
i recommend going with these
relatively small but is a secure
volume at about8 oclock and gain at about 3 oclock
rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap
it holds up the guitar
if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation
wow wow i cant believe it working wonderful
i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl
i was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself asap
but its a good pedal effect
this joyo jf03 crunch distortion pedal is just amazing
they work flawlessley and tune is amazing
great all round pick one of my favorites
i have been using monster for years
not everyone would have those
good quality material ensures i wont be needing another set for a long time
the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too
i moved the slider up and bang it worked
28to be fair someone did finally contact me today
i use these to play slide
i would try the fender
the packaging was also a bit confusing
this guitar will make you a more versatile player
i recently acquired a vox valvetronix ad100vt combo amp from my local music shop
it appears a little thinner than the original and just doesnt look as 34original34
get a roadie to do it for you
but you can do it
it has a fresh lemon scent
they dont sound as crisp as the daddario strings
i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work
cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist
that is all the volume i need for practicing in my home
say good bye to batteries
you will have to adjust your strap from the other side
good design easy to hang on to these picks
i personally guarantee your satisfaction
this stand is made of quality products
so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update
i bought this guitar humidifier for my taylor
i play while im playing crazy 8s with my son
i will no longer use other humidifying methods for my br243a
the price is right and shipping was right on time
all pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar
surprisingly loud really its amazing that much sound comes out of that thing
grab some extras because you will want more great pricegreat strings
would recommend this to anybody
i bought this just to see what everyone was raving about
a super cool little tin
ill be honest here  i bought this one primarily because of its looks
plus it was made in the usa
i dont use it all that often though
brass tacks they are velour
the shoulder strap tends to move while you play
my experience with the tungsol tubes was very very negative
should have paid the extra 40 and bought the mustang  oh well
works well with every pedal i tried so far
i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics
its the latest boss delay pedal
dont know why i didnt buy this years ago
mine arrived broken so it had gone back
does not leave streaks if used properly
beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck
just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper asian made
these tuning machines are great
i go with the rat
they sound great and hold their tone for a long time
well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio
now lets talk about how the pedal sounds
it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs
yes you can bend it
its important to you to know the diameter of your guitars soundhole
this is now a boat anchor
now its in the effects loop just like my other delay
frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing
its made of serious aluminum and the spring is supersolid
works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument
this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools
if you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin
but overall this is a great guitar
yeah i think i did
at less than 30incl shipping its a steal
i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers
the old amps we had were way too big
the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument
usb powered and plug and play
how many high notes will i be hitting on this baby
makes my crappy behringer amp sound
that was a disappointment for another reviewer for me its a plus
if its an instrument the sm57 delivers
well i just got started playing guitar and needed a tuner
a very good price for an excellent product
a budget this is your mic
it feel like leather but i am not 100 it is true leather
my verdict   go with medium or hard version
i use them when i play with my duet and sometimes with the band
i have never had one break
lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action
but passable id return it if i could
this meant drilling out the holes by another 18 of an inch
i hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done
unbeatable in price and quality
update 4413  added back a star
i re soak it easy 23 weeks or so
good strength  holds the strings down well
all dimarzio products are incredible
the strap button has a radius about 316ths of an inch
it runs on electric so no need for batteries
does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply
very inexpensive yet reliable cord
its not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing
microphone preamp is soso i guess
at less than half that its a steal
the capo is very easy to use as well
adjusted for inflation that would be 800 when i bought this jasmine
this music package by led zepplin is historical and put together well
keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking
its a feel good guitar
thank you fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size
the leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps
that couldnt be further from the truth
tip  these picks are great for high actionhigh gain guitar solos
d one love fender mustang you rock
shame on martin for such a piss poor product
when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them
there isnt any and it does not color your tone one bit
last week 4813 one of them wouldnt power up all the way
and all martin products are second to none
i have little experience with tube voodoo
lately ive become enamored of thekala kaubassfs solid mahogany ubass  fretted
this is very accurate and also very easy to use
48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain
great for back up singers
its won a spot on my pedalboard and im picky
this is a really strong capo
i mean really work well too
they arrived before the promised delivery date
much better sound perfect fit etc
so you just record as quietly as you can
not impossible but not terribly convenient either
this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver
when i asked music123 about this they said oh
this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more
i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp
daddario strings have never failed me
it is not meant for heavy rockmetalgrunge type music
new strings and scratch free
my son was very happy with this guitar strap
the price was right im happy with it
very high gainfits in all size soundholes
i dont use a long delay time in fact i dont max it out
not a huge deal but a consideration
the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings
ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all
its a good quality case
clamp it on and play
long lasting and great tone besides
closing thoughts unfortunately there really isnt a usb interface that has a good driver
i figure i got at least 249 worth of guitar for 99
this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig
i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise
they work well for that
unhappy with it actually i already replaced them
weight and sound is the same
i use them as room mics mainly for which they perform admirably
it tends to go distortion to the point of garble
this has come in handy many times in my studio z108net
i had this misconception that my hands 34just werent designed to play guitar34
dont get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable
this item really speaks for itself
good  power supply for the cheaper yamaha keyboards
the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal
normal plush fake fur inside with about 34 of soft foam all around
basically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound
rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard
suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment
they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand
my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand
i play while im watching the news
it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice
so it costs less because we dont need to use it as much
with the sm7b you dont have to
again nothing that cant be fixed with other effects
good  cable works for me using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch
but i guess you cant have it all
this is more common in vintage guitars though
got a vintage instrument you dont ever want to see hitting the floor
mxl really should reconsider its association with reaper
dont know why i waited so long to get one
most tremolos have it but not all
im a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished
plugged into my 65 twin reverb not a reissue but the real thing wow
in my opinion daddario is the standard by which all other strings are measured
i would highly recommend any plant waves cables
the pick guard looks a bit cheap but thats just nitpicking
34 then by all means knock yourself out
my next one will be an sm58 but that will be awhile from now
this amp probably is not for you
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
martin is a name that means quality
the other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built
i like the product a lot
all in all the h4n is a great field recorder
i did not notice any additional string wear or damage
i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail
i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat
it will probably outlast the guitar
ive removed 1 star because of the 14 casing
the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides
have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon
i bought two of these one for each of my sons 12 and 14
it was a good deal did the job
see if i could improve the situation
maybe a little clearer cleaner sound
this made me take a second look at schaller
very sturdy and light enough to easily carry
the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright
i recommend this little amp wholeheartedly
forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too
works as designed on my acoustic
these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables
took me about 15 hours
it doesnt feel like quality leather to me
in addition snarks customer service was very friendly and helpful
dont expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you wont be disappointed
works ok for the price and features it is fine
for the price its worth it i guess
it works nicely and for the price it was a steal
looking at the tension table daddario publishes its clear why this is the case
but they block sound so well you dont have to blast them
it has the same 6 strings tuned the same way
luckily one of the band members had another one
pretty simple even if youre technically challenged
one worked the other didnt
not too tight snug but not confining
i use it at practice and during our live shows
the second one is working fine so far
the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide
it feels solid wellconstructed and not very heavy
fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 60 amp
im using these with the behringer 1202fx mixer
but despite those limitations the bad monkey is awesome
i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome
what im loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like
all are fast and accurate
the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting
very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar
do you like to shift your booty around on the seat
they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in
its different and just worth having to mess around with
maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying
i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine
i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players
i own the black silver gold and camo kyser capos
its a simple cable what can be said
for the price you cannot go wrong with this
they snap right in carry sound well and come with a lifetime warranty
this is a great guitar for the money
i actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations
if they d35 sounded dull id notice
i have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them
only thing i found was that  the pin rockrd a bit
elixir strings are very nice
soft callouses  no callouses
i ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great
small enought to fit on top of a table or under it
hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space
i purchase these strings a lot for my son
thats why i dont use them anymore
the price was very good
its quite hard on your collarbone
stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely
it adjusts to fit different guitar necks and just sort of snaps in place
very secure effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe
it easily clamps onto my stand and doesnt move around after i place it
dropped the action back down and its smooth as silk in an hours time
it is worlds better than usb mics like the blue snowball
on that scale these strings would be above a literal medium
ive been using this one for about a year now with no problems
no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall
i also use one on my pedal board wouldnt use anything else
it wont handle well at a large space
the low price tag didnt hurt my feelings either
best purchase ive made this year
which never picked up the phone
really nice product for the price
these are mirrored by 60 userdefined profiles which are identical to the factory presets
for me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same
34 and it certainly did
this will definitely last a long time
the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend
variety of acoustic sounds possible
ive noticed that the current 34most helpful critical review34 mentions this same problem
easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap
price was good for a useful accessory
it needs some force to put it into place
i dont know the limit of overdubs but i havent reached it
these picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick
these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar
and the functionality is great
by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time
i would recommend this to anyone
there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds
well built and good adjustability
the fender medium is my second choice for picks
mr miyagi couldnt have said it any better
for a normal use this is quite good
bad points  1 the package it comes in says its a 20foot cable
ive always been partial to nickel wound particularly semiflatwound but i digress
of course amazon is always 5 stars in my book
means only that dr 40
switch it for this black one
i have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there
works perfectly for me it does got a nice made
i still love the pwma230 but i am no fan of its manufacturer
for this price i cant see why anyone would not like this pedal
personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass
stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity
it does twist around a bit when you handle it
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
the pp400 ultracompact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like its ultracompact
i will definitely purchase this kit again when i run out of the supplies
i use for both electric and acoustic guitars
i have 4 classical guitars 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string
this gig bag looks really sharp and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying
so i ended up returning it the next day
however if you mostly play rhythm id stick with the stock speaker
ehso for the pricehighly recommended
and the bx5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine
they may be more than the mando needs
i had problems getting it to work on my imac
quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence
low to the ground so balance is not an issue
and it sounds just as good as major brands
if you just want to play around a little this uke will do
this bottle will last a lifetime
didnt harm the finish at all
for the money you cant go wrong with this effect
i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it
it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed
this one was a good buy for the money
the cutter works great you just have to be careful
not literally a right angle but a very good angle
i know others love them so i guess its just a personal thing
ive only used them once for backup vocals and the results were good
i mean seriously how hard can it be
i use it for a hot rod deluxe
ive been using d addario strings for 20 years to great satisfaction
ill use a stand if im going to use a guitar often
bottom line is that it works very well for my needs
and take your time and this device should work fine
sound quality crisp mid and high range
it would be nice though not to have had to do that
this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion
that said ill say again the straplok system is a great product
i really cant say enough positive things about the apogee jam
once youve got them in or attempted to do so theyre never coming out
and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports
yes this pedal is made of plastic
i usually have a guitar on it all the time
it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm
i installed this pickup myself
works as advertised for polishing my guitars
nice padded seat well constructed
these look great and work perfectly
its a great mic for the price
the mark tremonti wah is great
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier
i dont know if its going to last me a while
its about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball
this is the 2nd set of these fender parts ive ordered
im sure other picks works just fine but these are always my preference
use for small music gigs and djmc uses
it plays very loud and clear zero buzzing
lolyou will need a 1532nd drill bit to complete the install
nice strap for the money
oh ya the grip is perfect
the strings are nice and smooth and springy very easy to press on
the cry baby has proven itself since the 60s
very satisfied with how it worked
this pick however takes it to the next level
buy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed
it will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which i love
its okay but it could be better
this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there
i bought two microphones a akg d5 and sm58
and if it gets banged up so what
now off to buy some different bridge materials
get hot to wear in the summer
makes tunning easy and fast
they last fairly long when taken care of and dont usually break too often
ill order another set for my other chibson
the time it saves is also invaluable
as i said this is small but really not a toy
as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning
this powergrip pedalboard mounting tape is velcro on steroids
the display is very easy to read
any less and id look dumb
transporting them in this case isnt
i bought it to use with my boss me70
this cleanspolishes all of my guitars great
i wanted an upgrade to my tu2 which i had for years
thats plenty high for me even if i were a vocalist and im 61
but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a dropin replacement
i love this pop filter
this gives me the same recording ability 9624 but it is much less expensive
this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone
its not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily
this is the best usb condenser mic ive ever used
however if youre just doing it as a hobbyside job
i put my kvm switch on it and other server components
the material its made of is good and it holds the guitar
users of mxr carbon copy swear by them
tested with a les paul with burstbucker pros the hiss was overwhelming
the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours
it does exactly what it says it does
despite the blemish episode it fits her perfectly
without this i would be lost
there are better deals for just slightly more money
this is the better choice for musicians
a rechargeable version would be good
i own several taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars
polish w an expansive polishing cloth
it holds about 6 to 7 picks
in my experience these cables were not great
it is a good piece and a good deal
it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise
i leave it plugged in on the board all the time
having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings
anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool
i put a baggs ibeam pickup in it also
i am only using for lightweight applications
just to find out it wasnt working
with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response
have to reorder soon  great strings for the money
so i sent it back
ill never go back to tuning by ear
this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost
i guess i need a little practice
these are made solid and are very stable
each of the legs has 3 holes low middle high
note it played well the way i got it just like my stuff perfect
some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use
i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons
driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones
just use a cloth or paper towel
i bought some planetwaves cables for 40 that didnt even last me 2 years
i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone
good product good service should be fine for years to come
it should be for the price
for most of us this is more than adequate
solid well padded sturdy latches and everything lines up
very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range
it is probably the most favored pick among all companies
so now it comes down to the shubb 1 deluxe and the planet waves
took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings
this one seem to perform just fine
the grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that
but i took a chance  this works well on my lp
the screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight
its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing
through sweat dirt and cigarette smoke they eventually start to look nasty
just be sure to use a good quality speaker cable like the gls
were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line
so far they seem awesome
i couldnt find the other one because theyre small and black
this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested
gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer
this was so inexpensive i couldnt pass it up
the things it wont do  1 a clean boost
i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better
i gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully
i figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too
the spherical receiver makes the xm8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands
sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off
the sound is also really good its very resonant and just sounds 34good34
the box is plastic but it is solid abs plastic and is perfectly adequate
this item was purchased because im doing selfteaching on the fiddle
these cables are nicely constructed
this may be 10watts but it can fill a big room with its sound
in fact it likely even adds bass to your sound
it offer a lot of variations in echo delay types
i recommend trying it out
they work well and sound amazing
i was totally surprised that it actually works this good
whether you get brass or glass is your preference
do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab
that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use
if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case
they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look
this is a very reasonable price for this bag
makes a fair snare drum mic
i would happily buy elixirs in bulk if i had faith in their shelflife
i am sure i will get more
i dont know why some people hate it
this is a cheap and easy upgrade
if you want 5 minutes of nononsense clean looping and overdubbing
not much else to say
if there is any latency i cant hear it
still these are nice picks
this is an analog pedal an the only digitech pedal ive ever contemplated keeping
then a friend told me hed switched from the thomastiks to these
i put this in a 200 guitar
the fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great
they bendnicely and sustain just as well
what you need to know about this mic 1 this mic is very directional
the dr07mkii has worked well for over 100 classes recorded
straight into a guitar amp it gave plenty of volume
no more extra messy cabling
i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out
really efficient way to go in my opinion
you can power any lightweight 9v 12 or 18v stompbox with this
it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right
it stays in tune and it high quality
i ordered this kit to see what it would do
behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny
now the thing is worthless
works great for podcasting vocals or anything else you want to record
comfortable and very nice fabric
some have complained that its construction is not the best
not a good start though
i have been using these strings for the last 7 years
oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
the quick release and secure connection are great
a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds
love the tone i can obtain too
i replaced a set of strings that were very used with these martins
i think this guitar rest is pretty nice
but why go to all that trouble
this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is 34 size
easy enough as i completed this is one minute
i havent had to change mine in almost two years since ive had it
they dont need any string cleaners either
i had that one first and it is horrible to use
try it you wont be disappointed
overall a reasonable value and im glad i bought it
i am happy with it
they hold a nice amount of picks
like they were made for it
i dont play these myself i bought them for my daughter
i have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite
absolutely no complaintsissues at all
i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet
i am very pleased with it
great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks
but the pushing against your head is the tight part
however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it
they seem well put together and just feel nice
overall they work really well and look sharp
this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice
this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like
i got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall
my fretboard hasnt been cleanedoiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry
never had one go scratchy
works and sounds really good
on the female side probably one few out of many lets hope
if youre a metalhead stay away
this is a pick for the precision player
they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new
i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it
i cant recommend them highly enough
in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money
you need to dedicate an fx bank now
just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc
in closing spend the 40 buck and get this
for some reason this one just doesnt hit the notes right
if broken or lostwho would steal it
first some clarification is needed on 34tube34 vs
one for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great
a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made
i like the big size type
i have this hooked up to 4 pedals so far and its awesome
dont buy these if you have a large thumb
since no two distortions sound the same
the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing
thats what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses
it can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory
i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program
these are the only strings i use on my acousticelectric
great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness
perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard
whether dubbing audio recording instruments or just yelling at the top of your lungs
not all gold hardware is the same color gold
just remember to hold the power button to turn it off
whats not to like here
build quality 45i did have 1 problem with the high e tuner
i got three single channels and two dual channel units
i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently
i personally wouldnt give a nickel for them
they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon
wawa pedals come and go and get modded and rethunk
not as good as say a boss unit but they cost 5x as much
the first issue is with thick straps
its a must have and thats really all there is to say
i take it everywhere and it has never let me down
steel shaft will probably last
i currently own 60 or so guitars
first a word about the negative reviews
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either
makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier
after putting in new pegs and restringing with these strings
lee oskar harps are the best value
im a teacher not a student
maybe there is something i need to do differently
other than that this was a great investment
a nice little amp to rock out with
i bought the first about 10 years ago
now my gear is always ready
i like the black look to my guitar now
it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those
you cant beat this for the price
second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy
this was time and money well spent
got this for an sgstyle guitar and it fits with plenty of room
attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head
these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch
didnt purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review
make sure the voltage matches
sturdy mic clip on a budget
the sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost
increases projection and tone to any stock strings
a value and a half
but why not give these lighter strings a try
i highly recommend for the shred guitarist
folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal
i have many planet waves cables
this is still my favorite pick for strumming
very pleased with the product and price
which is how it can run up to 8 pedals
not a lot of moving parts on this piece
i got it in red
this is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus but distinctly noticeable regardless
i had it shipped off and back in 7 days
the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver
granted you can make a makeshift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon
too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle
if theyre used for live performances they will not last very long
no tubes means no tube issues
though it takes eq well and you can eq that in
i bought this amp to replace a squier sp10 that came with my guitar
the material is nicersofter than the original so that is a plus
i would purchase another if i needed it
but a cheap item you cant use is money thrown away
i may swamp them out fo this one
they are easy to install
its so darn simple to use
i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar
the corners of the case are well reinforced
a great deal for a nominal amount of money
top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon
ive been playing for more than 30 years
place it gently no need to press it too hard
does it do exactly what you want a simple slapback echoreverb to do
maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me
seems solid and well built
it even fits my acoustic 12 string
hvr considering the price i think its excellent
this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me
what do they call medium or small
this was an excellent purchase
it is a very nice strap and will last years
however now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome
it stays in tune and is fun to play
especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time
perfect for what i want to do
i wasnt happy that its form was deformed
i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results
inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic
and during the time ive tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars
i dont often capo my guitar
it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing
it makes placement a snap
takes you hours to play around with all the sounds
the satch amplug is a welcome addition to my collection
wanted to hang my guitars on the wall
i highly recomend this guitar
nice quality and love the cutter
if theres even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it
long time shubb user but decided to try something different
its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility
as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio
very stable and they make tuning a joy
it is not heavy and the price is good
it has a deep tone and good volume
its a great price and its definitely worth the investment
you can barely hear it in the next room
i just ordered another set for my strat hss
this a great device to put my genuine planet waves signature picks in
the 57 also seems to have more low end girth
so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality
the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long
no expensive pads to buy just use water
the other cleaners and polishes are great too
however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know
i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else
i have had 2 of these tuners youd think id learn after one
again this is with les paul humbuckers
great quality in it also
is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition
this is a pretty cool product
i bought these primarily because they are so cheap
the true test was an actual live performance
it holds your picks and sticks to your guitar
you wont go wrong with this capo
the overdrive has a level tone and overdrive
when this arrived i didnt realize it was that small
i was very surprised how well built it is
i bought these xlr cables for my mobile dj rig and they perform flawlessly
the hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability
it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment
the final time i tightened them down the high e string broke
it wasnt even a little bit sharp
i have been using hercos for for many years
in my humble opinion cotton twill is totally the way to go
after rebooting the computer the problem went away
these are pretty good quality tweed cables
im definitely a fan of joyo products
took them off within an hour and put back on ej16
can find anything better for this cheap
my first tuners battery it came with lasted over a year
i dont just love the products
it works very well on a pedalboard
i love the snark tuners and i own several different models
i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry
im very pleased with these
tried them and he was right
it gives the boost i need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever
this one by far evolved from good design
pros  size size and size
still a great product though
the 2534 is wide and comfy
theyre very small about the size of a nickle so youve been warned
even the bag is nice
i have been using this preamp for a year and it has been great
010s but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these
ive had it for about 5 or 6 years now
this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well
if i get a new computer i will update my review
im pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny
fantastic deal for this cable
this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow
the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence
so far this board has performed superbly
and this has been great to have an endless supply
such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy
the mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand
i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these
fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances
you cannot find a better guitar for this price
with just a simple screw it comes right off
that did not last long
it is also very long longer than i thought
they work great  you cant beat the price
it is recording my guitar beautifully
but that is honestly to be expected
the 65 deluxe model sounds better with the 57 deluxes cab and vice versa
of course the board is layed out a little differently
i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed
simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear
in a church setting this is obviously not an option
the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand
but overall its a great product
this set of strings is fantastic
again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well
unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish
bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome
other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems
and i love this tuner
a must for pedal boards
works great with my fender super champ x2 amplifier
this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders
tons of verb if you want it
the heavy bottons 32 42 and 52 adds a boom in the tone
cant even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like
needed this cable to hook up my dean evo to a practice amp
this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly
i have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible
this is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people
i have several guitars and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar
its tuning range is 12 note
they had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support
do i fully understand how this works
well its a cloth and i use it to wipe my guitar
so far im very happy with this microphone
the volume control is obvious
save your money and buy a better cable
fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick
you never know until you try
i like the planet waves instrument cables
great for a quick practice and really sounds nice
i also heard about the wonderful warranty that monster has
it works fine for the handy type recorders
i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks
ill get this one again
these are value cables after all
snark has a good tuner for low price
if youre toating between practice with an instructor its okay
34 especially since its designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously
youll get latency with any type of recording device
i remembered 34eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie34 and just tuned away
there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand
still for sanitys sake id position the stand close to a wall
it was a hassle but i got it done nicely
love  love this guitar
as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals
this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect
i saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets
sound very good and for the price it cant be beat
go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogoogle
and have for 40 years
the shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order
this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money
they continue to work to this day
i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material
its easily 12 the thickness of any guitar cable ive used
i dont have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers
for me the added benefit just isnt worth the effort
i do like this pick as well
this is a palnet waves and just as good as the more expensive ones
lately i have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings
the other ones must be for some special type of music
tubes come out of the same two or three places anymore
it is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely
amazon seems to have great prices and its nice to have them delivered too
i am self taught guitar for about 15 months
i have received many compliments on the look of it already
however these definitely arent reliable gigworthy tuners
best distortion i ever used
it is flexible yet stationary
sell your sm57s for 60 and turn them into two of these
the sound quality is excellent
a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic
update  i have had this pedal now for about 1 12 years
thats a huge range for any tuner
you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks
excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii
i really like these strings
however it is handy for short solos
over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand
the color of the device
it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers
the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife
am very happy with what i got for the price i paid
if the battery dies they are tone deaf
made from good materials and is attractive
its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off
not much to say here other than it works and works well
this tabletop mic stand works
overpriced 15 to 2x in my opinion
accurate and quick  great for between song quick tuning
but all are for radiused fingerboards
i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work
buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately
this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box
this item does the job
when i opened the box was surprised as i didnt notice the usb cable
also it costs less money
just a little cheaper in cost perhaps
these picks are a good change of pace
this device has delivered everything i wanted and more
but i think thats the best light to shine on this one
the sn2 senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup
the portable feature is great also
i bought these for my music class
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode
these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guidetree
i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal  what a difference
ive used shure sm58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968
i like the martin coated as well but i prefer the elixer
i dont mess with the noise gate so i cant really comment on that
not much of that complaint here
this compares very closely to my high end od pedals i own
i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar
my choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics
the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone
anyway i ended up keeping the guitar a jackson dk2m
i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened
ive been using the dunlop delrin 500 20 picks
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products
marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts
as far as longevity and durability time will tell
bends and slides are smoother than ever
dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with
the extralong 1300 millisecond delay is great for pink floyddavid gilmour style solos
plus it is extremely low priced
i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying
they are great for holding picks  make wonderful gifts
tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp
this music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units
tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing
great strings at a great price
it fits well on my les paul and strat
but thats not what guitars are for right
the best few bucks youll spend on guitar care
if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal
behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it
i have about quit using picks now
windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups
they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers
for the money its really hard to beat
i use these on all my guitars
ive owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years
however there are workarounds like just switching tracks
i dont have not one bad thing to say
i feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones
but were talking 1000 tube amps
the stand is very well constructed and very stable
but the hard wedgie is the clear winner
ive always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work
the new driver actually works
not so  it was made heavier and nicer
they rotate in full circles and are super durable
i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead
this requires of course the addition of a 14 inch adapter plug
addendum 12132011if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection
my american special strat came with 3 springs and now has the five
the tech at the guitar shop cant see how either
i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths
this works just as stated
its worth its weight in gold
im a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars
it is easy to assemble
all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes
three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step
so i recommend them but be aware of its limitations
now im spoiled and ive become a guitar strings snob
plays well and keeps in tune
the thing is dense and build solid as a rock
but it was a bit of a pain
less time tuning  more good time playing
what can i say about a guitar strap
the pick pocket is cool though i wont be using it
a web search will reveal countless workarounds
well surprise surprise surprise it didnt feedback and it sounds great
these strings really do feel and sound great
the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance
they sound great and are priced right
ultimately theyre simply the best for the money
it truly makes the task many times easier
i have a 300 strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it
at around 450 for six picks these are some expensive pieces of plastic
there isnt a huge difference
its compact has great voice pickup and audio recording clarity
these work well with the telecaster tone and string through design
i love love love these strings
the amp is on my belt
i love it so much ive purchased this and my  own shure mic
it does not work well with a daisy chain power supply
i buy tons of them all the time
ive bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit
i have nothing negative to say about this
these are the same strings i paid much more for in my store
my take on it your mileage may vary
it doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either
plugged it into my fender mini tonemaster amp
ill never buy this brand again
you have to see the guitar face to face to understand what i mean
great product for the price
i dont plan on hammering my acoustic anyway
might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying
good presentation and well packed
you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out
theyve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings
good sustain and strings are staying in tune well
this gig bag is well worth the price
you can pay more but i dont think you get that much more
i really like the way the tungsol makes my jazzmaster sound
more organic than plastic picks
ive heard some complaintsworries about the flimsiness of the plastic
never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for 20
i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing
the shure sm57 sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged
i love being able to adjust the tension
full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound
good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china
i purchased this model for home usenot for a kids backpack
the tone destroys the line 6 and the features crush the vox pathfinder 6watt
i use it for external audio recording for dslr video
update  received 6 of these
over all though this is great for lightly distorted  edge of distorted sounds
well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning
leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap
my budget must be tripled at least
color coded ballends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention
its definitely a great value
it works well for my home recording
certainly worth every penny you pay for them
for what its worth i am a professional musician with perfect pitch
realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar
i didnt notice much of a difference between these and runofthemill daddario strings
why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately
it is exactly as represented
i see some people complaining about the strings
its been good i cant really complain considering its basically tree sap
stays very firm on the arm
the korg cm100l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product
if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins
it just snaps on to your mic stand
adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard
what can i say this pedal has never left my pedalboard
ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors
they are on the small side
and as an end user a upc sticker serves nobody
actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great
they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment
the tone is very good but not exceptional
this one is done right
very responsive and never dull or weak sounding
you use a average weight mic or4
any number of mods can be found online to change the sound
the fit is nearly perfect
this is a must have
will buy more when needed
some things just dont need to change
so i want to keep a completed pack for back up
i guess this is typical for distortion boxes
firstfinding a driver to use was a pain
if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route
these picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side
this was an impulse buy
works as described on the ipad
there is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke
this ranks right up there as the best money i ever spent on equipment
plenty of compartments for all of your accessories
much better than the more economical ones sold
the last amplifier i purchased was a fender twin valve some years ago
yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not
ive used elixirs for about five years now
i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great
need a little variety in your life
it can holds all the my guitars with no issues
i would buy this again
small lightweight and very easy to use dose the job well
it shipped in an envelop
i didnt like the ac adaptor
removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort
cant wait to see how it does after it breaks in
everything just works great first time
it came to me right on time with no problems at all
ive tried eh nano grail
this one really appealed to my son because of the front design
it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon
and they just plain feel good to use
i think that you will love it if thats what youre looking for
when im on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish
but its really worth the hassle
this pack comes with 6 picks
it sounds good on my guitar and its not that expensive
they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most
it looks good as while
here is the gorgeous tone i had missed
but i personally do not like how it looks of it when installed
all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue
will just move on to another companys cord
windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver
hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for
im a really happy customer now
the g7th performance capo is priceless
awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop ab
he says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality
but they are what they are
no hassle with the right jacks and stuff
its the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place
the adjustment knobs dont seem to do much either
this mixer has four mic inputs
they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead
i own many tuners and clip ons of many other brands
the coated ones are medium which is too heavy for me
the elixir 8020 comes out on top
hopefully there wont be long term issues
placed it on top of my 18 crash and it looks great
but i see that most are the same
its too stiff not comfortable at all
to my computer for mixing duties in reaper
shoulder strap works just fine
not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style
this was was better then i expected
ive posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page
doesnt have the same feel either
really packs a punch haha
this is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings
this case will definitely do the trick
its very easy to use and rugged
if youre doing something similar to me im sure you will be too
i absolutely love it and im glad that the aluminum ones are durable
this a great cable for practicing at home
now im in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers
we got a good deal too
there are tonal differences as expected
some i might not use but there are plenty i will use
i would have much better liked it if they were metal
opened up one recently and the
this is my first fender amp and probably not my last
i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand
responds fast display is incredible
it fits well close well protects well transport well
acoustic and elixir electric strings as well
i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack
oh and the case is a 40 freebee  buy one be happy
i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound
please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut
you shouldnt have any problems
i think it will work great for that
works as well as locking strap buttons did for me
i would recommend it to anyone
the behringer us600 is wellmade
they have good sound quality
everything i would want in a gig bag
beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle
i guess if anything thats been the downside to this purchase
if you are looking for a 100 leather mandolin strap consider another strap
the 34strat34 is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard
ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one
im using on one of my cheaper guitars
replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better
zero buzz across the board
they make a very deep and loud noise
pads take too much presure to activate
there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob
not much to say here
this one only tunes in the uke keys
came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd
i really like the design
the telescope mechanism is quite well made
these strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely
the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam
the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal
totally nofrills rock solid metal construction and you cant hear it at all
good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should
i am very happy with it
i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass
makes it look really smart
the readout is easy to see in any light
one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway
got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this
weighs a ton cool logo made in usa
i think its a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly
thats an a in my book
i like the feel and texture of these 34pics34
honestly i wont restring my fender with them ill use the fender 250 bullets
they are clear clean cables
i have owned almost every octaveharmonizerpitch shifter on the market
i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone
the ones i got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture
i usually use dunlop big stubby 20 picks
i just tried them just to try
it really makes the guitar stand out
i am absolutely delighted with this tunner
i have made them last up to 2 months
the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point
its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass
give it a test drive and let your ears decide
ive used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces
whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear
the korgstyle dialin reverb controls are easy but extremely limited
overall this is a very good capo and i can recommend it without hesitation
i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar
this is a xlr cable
i am pleased with it
perhaps the primary dealmaker or breaker  the tiny screen and small controls
its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use
no matter i wont be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again
turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock
but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster
the only con i could give is if they go bad
only complaint battery doesnt last too long
outlet 6 is a 12v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power
coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years
i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too
ive used it  at both inside and outside gigs without any problems
this is a great little tuner
i decided to try out the powergrip and have been extremely impressed
picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound
but you need to attach it with something
great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great
more than worth it though
i say this because you cant say anything bad about this pedal
it is a bit like discussing our likes in food musicians movies
highly recommend the classic rock  5 stars
i mentioned that these are for inside playing
now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these
one final note about behringer
i believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand
i am glad i did
otherwise it would be a 5 star
i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome
big bold bottom end with some singing highs
best quality than polytune  1 lighter and best switch
5 stars to amazons return policy thouh
it probably wont protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack
they all sound very cool on this amp
but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all
this worked out of the box
the output is muted while the tuner is engaged
this is a simple analog chorus
now with my boss rc3 i can do it any time i want
you have to take the pedal off to access the battery
for the first 3 days the strings sound strange
i like it its ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion
if you want something close on
this stand even accommodates a double neck
its pretty accurate on that neck up to the 4th fret
no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric archtop
these stands are just what i wanted for my studio
i would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user
rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like theyll last a while
definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future
shipping takes time but for the price who cares
this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized
use it with your headphones or home speakers
they are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones
metal case compact nice bracket lighted remote telling you when its ready
these are nice clean tubes that react consistently
i wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well
this is one of the nicer capos ive used
not when that string is toast in 50 minutes zero doubt there
he really likes it a lot
overall a very useable metronome
no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery
usually they are too small
i will never switch from the pick
then i tried this recipe
it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar
perfect stand as long as you dont have othersroomateskidspetsetc
where is this pedal now in my collection
i thought why not try a 2 in 1 formulation
the case is very nice and sturdy
think it sounds like a trash can lid
i returned this one early
i had to have more like an addiction
they last forever and dont break
used to tune with a tuning fork
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars
its an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
it is possible that this capo may become my favorite
they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily
using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp
it is a nice smaller version of the 114si road pro
this is a very heavy guage
i bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there or across town
and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price
it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune
i have spent a good month with my new guitar and i am impressed
super buy on this miniamp
there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz
no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldnt handle the load
one of them is a capo
made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal
fret and its right on the 34money34
just a good basic cable
the 3 modes are nice
it will probably last my entire lifetime
it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the onoff switch does nothing
also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle
it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal
but this is a keyboard not an organ
might work well for recording too when you take the output jack
im sure it can be done using the fuse editor
for such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service
i built a custom cabinet and installed this baby
makes the strings nice and easy to fly over
otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance
good buy for the price
i was pleased for that
aside from that this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit
i wish there was a fine pivotangle adjustment to orient harp to mouth
the balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems
does what it is suppose to do
ill make a video and post it soon
the quality and feel of this tuner is very good
i have them installed on all of my guitars
no issues in that regard with the fatso
these strings sound great with great dynamics on them
highly recommended for those playing bluesfunkrock
i enjoy using it with both my fender strat and my rickenbacker
they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound
i dont have to wait for it to snap back it doesnt bend
a  34musthave34 if you play in pits or other dimlylit venues
not many frills to this bag
it works well for sure
the model number is 333001 probably also discontinued
the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions
a guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under 500
unfortunately they sent the wrong one but ill use it anyway
i have several of them and they have all performed well
the perfect wall mount for a ukulele
restrung my guitar with no problems
id prefer something more white
there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today
the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking
they work great theyre quiet and theyre cheap
unfortunately it was the wong switch
sounds great on amps and perc
some other people have made the same discovery also
crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it
5 stars because it works as its described and has a nice display
i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack 802 that i had
arrive on time and as described
this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too
i have no hissing and no problems
worth every penny mind you
for the price i am very pleased
however it broke not too long after i bought it
sounds clear and crystal good unplugged
that iswhen i decided to get the dunlop polisher  cleaner
made in the usa to boot
it may just take practice
this is the first one ive bought that had the smaller transducers
it does the job though
the only downside is that its a bit rough on any loose skin
easy to use very accurate highly recommended
made by daddario the quality lives up to the brand
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you
given to sister from mysel
but these microphones were a game changer for me
the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board
the absolute best guitar stand made
besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me
still you cant go wrong either way
its light dont know if it would handle major abuse but wow
i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out
ive run my strat tele and taylor t5 through this
it has no paperwork or owners manual
these picks are the bomb
the look is not that inspiring but it protects your guitar
one of the best tuners out there
since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them
for an inexpensive unit this thing rules
i do suggest some accessories when using the h4n
so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early
this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths
the shape and ergonomics are a mix between a kyser and a schubb s1
at that price its an amazingly good deal
i try others but always come back to them
these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips
the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip
theyre great easytoread and easytouse tuners that are surprisingly cheap
the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward
i bought a couple of these two years ago
happy with it  like it
if you like being in tune this is probably for you
this thing folds up so it is easy for storing
great pedal once you get it dialed in
makes any guitar look so much classier
then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation
i just cant get enough sustain out of the high efor my taste
i have played guitar professionally for over 27 years
the stand is sturdy too
i also have a danelectro  fab echo and this just blows it away
i use it every week and it still sounds perfect
that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost
they make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well
even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud
for 20 you cant go wrong
but these are great and you should get em
but they look great work great stay in tune and are completely vintage spec
i am not hard on cables
i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar
all in all not great this tiny stand
they do need 48 v phanom power from your board or a mic amp
best mike for the price and purpose
now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there
shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner
i was really worried about scuffing it up
i agree with the others reviews
i tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs
supports a lot of weight
and such a good price
has worked very well so far
the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish
great portability for the price
if you play the blues
this tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion
the tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice
they sound and feel great
very happy with this low cost strap
ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life
other then that nothing id change
adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone
i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one
these cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the usa
works well to keep finger prints off
its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed
this was very easy to put together
the stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string
great little tuner very accurate and portable
im sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well
in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful
it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks
they are still going strong
the rubber grip area is great
goes to show how diverse they are
padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected
it is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse
it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing
make changing strings a whole lot easier
3 great vocal microphones in its own protective case with its own holders
that was initially what brought me to the micro
i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceasedbad dexterity
if your looking for crap that doesnt work
i cant explain it exactly
i just started in april after taking vocals for a year
this was a great compromise between portabilitystorage and sturdiness
the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff
this is ok if you are using a full boom that8217s facing the singer
i purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the behringer uf0202
i also use it for an older digitech pedal and works like a charm
its simply not sturdy enough physics or no
it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on
one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb
but for my purposes that is a plus
im very happy with the solid build
i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
this is just adequate for my use
there are others on the market to be sure
easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em
i guess i thought being felt they wouldnt be so stiff
otherwise spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting
i figure 12 dozen will last me for years
this is much easier and the guitar sounds great
a few more inches would have been appreciated
lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference
i like emeven if they are purple
this has been a very useful tool
does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise
good spring action made pretty solid
the color is darker than pictured on amazon  black powder coating
in my house i dont have to play quietly when rehearsing
it also fit my tele to
and i really like this one
easy to install and remove
it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs
who doesnt love these tuners
dont get me wrong the sans amp is still great
i would buy these again
boss is the company that dominates my effects board
3 tools in one handy spot
i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me
great deal for the price and very sturdily made
works just fine thank you
the national mediums i was using before had a looser fit boggle
but it works fine never had any problems with it
for 10  which is also half the price at your local guitar shops
forgot to mention the nice packaging
bought six still have six a week later
this is a great small gig or practice amp
they sound great on my martin too
it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range
no problem as i bought one as a spare against emergency breakage
the other effects are icing on the cake
but variable speed would have been nice
even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dustshedding they do
5 stars on that alone
yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers
i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not
great way to wake up the kids
i bought it for my church and the drum sounds great
i use them for playing bass
i also tried the bugera v22 all tube amp at the same guitar center
ive got 5 effects hooked up to this thing
did boss just start making multieffects pedals
this is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
i have been using dunlop picks for a long time
lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth
then again i never mistreat my equipment
this will get you in tune for 11 or less  cant beat it
they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case
these are good quality cables at an economical price
fit my 07 mim strat perfectly
and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard
the quality control is so so
ive used this stand for about two years now and it held up great
will do the job of good protection
classic tubescreamer tone at 14 the price
windows 7 didnt need to install any driversit was plug n play
summary if you need a preamp buy this one
not upset about that  stuff happens
once in sound hole pickup did not work at all
by far the best acoustic strings period
its a pretty cool little gizmo
i was pleasantly surprised to find it wellmade with a clean simple appearance
it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up
if you need a beater this is it
i like thin picks myself and this one is very thin
you retune your guitar to an open tuning
i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them
you really cant go wrong
i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals
and there is room for more if i need it
ive used these most of my life and will continue to
do yourself a favor and avoid them
dont use the bridge pickup as it doesnt sound too good
i bought these to try them out
im telling you get it
the behringer cs400 is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc9 i discuss below
i found it really warmed up my sound in a good way
loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board
cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another
fits nice and made well
i did not think that an amp this size would sound good
i like medium picks and this feels comfortable
it just might not be your sound
knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm
the drum presets are fun to use
no need for a fancy pansy 50 metal mesh screen
i like it and it is small
all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar
these picks have served me very well
installed these fender locking tuners and voila
i got this to plug into my computer
we bought this tester for our son to use for his bands equipment setup
when i told them the price they thought i was pulling there leg
it may be a challenge to assemble it
as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere
though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own
the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp
sturdy enough well priced and simple to use
i really enjoyed this tuner extremely fast an accurate at tracking you
if you drop a pick there is another right there
they need to fix the info on their web page
the price went up nearly 50 on them though
press a third time to dub on top of your last layer
this worked well for that
i switched to these and havent broke a string since
typical behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound
they are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them
its hard to beat this box at any price
i recommend messing with it quite a while
no nasty residue build up over time
ill try returning it and getting the sn8
its a foam cushion with a neck supporter
these snark tuners are really cool
hard not to like that
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment
thankfully i still have most of these picks
this product is straight forward and works as its intended
behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why
i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust
very smashing pumpkins feel to this
you might find that youre a convert within seconds
this will work for just about everyone
best buy i have made on a product i couldnt try out first
it senses the entire scale
just put these on my martin dcx1e and they sound great
i purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap
it rejects whats behind and to the side but in front its pretty sensitive
save your money and get something better than this
id assume it was made out of castiron or something instead of aluminum
piece of cake if u practice
for the price why not
and nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive
im very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat
but this for the quality
or adult bottled beverage while playing
the price was right too
great that they have uniform tension
it is not the best but the sound is superior
it is amazing what difference the strings can make
nothing fancy but simple and to the point
the picks feel great and im having a good time
works very smoothly and doesnt eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners
it gets abused so i dont look for it to last long
perfect intonation all the way up to the octave
are hard to beat when it comes to durability
in particular i favor the dual design
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone
well built and solid stand
leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars
the hardware is what you would expect from a yamaha product
i heard more definition with the guitar
when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised
it is very sturdy and holds big music books very well
to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior
your strings will thank you
i ordered both this one and the lee oskar
california with the classic fender name scribed
even without a guitar and an amp its still fun to have
these are the best cables for the money
i was expecting something a little bigger
this capo is solid and well made
these take less room  and cut down on the clutter
i note that there are reviews here as old as four years
if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues
i have a monster m rock12 cable
i own a few of them
it is a good choice for a beginner
that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius
his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products
im happy with this purchase
the tone range is generous from mellow to high treble
fit very well my mic
okay  color coding is a great idea
they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackityclack noise
i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product
8 opened garageband got  no input message
it also has a lifetime guarantee
i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly
not the best but for the price was a killer deal
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick
i was amazed at the tones i could pull out of it
these are nice and bright
good quality with sealed connectors
i checked in my case
i plugged in my martin hd28 and all went well
i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal
after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself
the intelli imt500the tuner that killed the intellitouch
but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder
if you are looking for a les paul guitar this is not one
ive had no problems with the ones ive bought
ahhh this is a guitar strap
my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings
the body is very solid beautiful finish mine is a sunburst color
i hate changing strings without one anymore
in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it
i like the layout of controls as well
i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat
this is my second and i love them so much
these locking ends are the ticket
ill definitely be buying more of these
and on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the price
this product works just fine
smooth but not dull sounding
the epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days
your situation might be different than mine
if you dont have a ts type pedal this is a good cheap choice
i am sure this will give him years of entertainment
even at that i consider it a good buy
i hear its good for vocals as well
i purchased these picks because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band
this combo string winder peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
the snark i chose has been working just great for me
the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud
this guitar strap performs as expected for its price
i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads
it fits so well in my hands and feels great
simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just
i like the old version more
i noticed the difference on guitar
you cant really get there without actual tubes being distorted
really should be 1434 mono or stereo
well made and you cant beat the price
decent quality ends and build
best price i have found is at amazon
overall its a solid cable for practice
im pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sps
the description on amazon fits the c1u not the c1
dunlop also makes quality picks and i have yet to break one of these
the snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything ive ever seen
anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one
i tried the cad m179
i love these little guys
my pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now
what can i say that you havent already read about this amazing pedal
it was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it
i was surprised when i tested this microphone
no loss of tone through these cables
the strings are some kind of cheap nylon
they are wellmade easy to play guitars
they sound wonderful  right out of the box
they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot
you also still might need your other fx
for the price this is the best tuner out there right now
also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands
the wahs were usable but just did not sound as good
its red burst like the legacy fender calls it antique burst
i have to admit this up front  im a terrible bass player
not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars
i have kk pickups in other guitars
dunlop univibe uv1  cool stainless steel construction
it just feels a little tight and crammed when i wear it
this string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body
they play great have nice action and tone
the cops wont come knocking to serve a noise complaint
also a great mike for doing voiceovers
i say this one just may be a keeper
typical plastic durable and looks good
ive tuned violins guitars and ukeleles with it
i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures
effective and built like a tank
the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy
once you start playing you dont notice it though
you can mess around swapping parts pickups and capacitors
simply plug it in and find the right drivers
adjustment is easy and effective
holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise
i use light daddaro strings and love the tone and feel
buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts
what can one say about a cable
besides that its highly recommendable to anyone
gets the job done and it is inexpensive
whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future
has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models
i just wish more came in the pack
the us322 comes with a printed quick start guide
you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank
this thing is a tank
if not for that id have rated 4 stars
it doesnt take much to work
check them out they carry ok equipment
it is easy to use
for 29 bones you simply cannot beat it
it was easy to install and the finish was perfect
last forever and easy to hold onto
i got this to install it on a podium
works great right out of the box
the input 14inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid
with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar
did it improve my life
if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably
it will probably last 2 life times
average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner
just dont drop one of these on you tile floor
reaching for pics is never a problem
cheap so no big loss
lots of looping time simple to use unlimited overdubs
ive always been a fan of these fender classic picks
jc clean black panel brit combo and rfier mean nothing to me
its also lighter than the others mentioned which is a plus for traveling musicians
i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good
my primary concern is  how does the pedal sound
easy to use portable cheap
this is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest
planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well
if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it
sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs
yep i said it better than a tubescreamer
this slide is very thick and works great
wow it really did make a huge difference
does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack
works fine with my mixer
works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power
i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue
it works better than my piano
they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout
product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller
looks vintage but works great at a great price
unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq
for others they may not appreciate this
replaced everything but the body
bought stand as a gift for my sons acoustic guitar
these the dunlop primetones felt picks metal picks etc
i just turn the mic off
i forgot how dim led lights are
the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals
im pretty much old school and like to find my own sound
sweet action durable and very affordable
most importantly they sound great
buy it youll like it
i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just cant compete
i only use 34 pedals and this is always one of them
they help nail his tone and are slick light feel and handle bends perfectly
i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money
can be quite sibilance prone so beware
i have used the line 6 looper in the past line 6 jm4 looper
i did not care for the tone or feel
i put it on when necessary on gig breaks
highly recommended for the price
these ultex are much better
this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction
the accuracy is as good or better than any ive used
fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med
i got this for my wireless mics but they dont fit in this holder
an opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective
mxr make pretty good pedals for the money
it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp30
excellent sound quality much better than any other mic ive used
these work just like you want them to
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
i know tone and have had great and not so great gear
i would highly recommend this to others
i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion
i wouldnt perform with it but great for personal use
interestingly enough i dont leave this pedal on all the time
there is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about
you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time
but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long
its long enough to allow my bass to rest at arms length
it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker
keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag
i personally found the mullard to be the best
i cant speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors
does this wok great on a budget absolutely
like always boss products are just amazing
this my second hosa guitar cable
thats what i finally did and am still most happy with this device
it is a single strip of leather with no padding
however to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable
this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted
i bought 2 of these and will order a few more
it isnt a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb les paul
these picks are bigger than i expected
plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it
they are very sensitive so i feel that my instrument is in truer tune
for the most part this is a well builtdurable gig bag
this is of course via the front panel only
it is doing exactly what i expected and much more
again do your youtube homework and listen around and youll come to your conclusion
so i found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine
hate to see how the mediums fit
the tuner is easy to use
this picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones
the size of the clipon gt1 one is also great
you wont get a slightly fizzy ultragain think slipknot sound out of this pedal
onoff in either direction with full torque
add 34apogee one mic mount34
these phosphor bronze models have found a home on my epiphone flattop
always have a few spares that have been tested
and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has
absolutely no complaints about these cables
this pedal is very nice
if you play fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings
i recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb
covers all strings and depresses them fully
these are exactly what the doctor ordered
not that a guitar should ever be considered clutter
i have been online shopping banjos quite
i really like this tuner
a 90 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration
i have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it
i primarily play live and i am a toneoholic
can be used either sitting or standing
it is affordable and the material is solid enough that it can withstand abuse
and it works on so many instruments
this ukes sound is at least as good as a 50100 dollar uke
it was held by only one small tac weld
great guitar by the way for the price
buy a few youll be glad you did
lots of good presets and capabilities
it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight
i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb
i am a future m audio customer from here on
keeping in mind im a guitar player who just bought a drum kit
this stand is great for my 45lb peavey 1500
you may have to put something behind it or replace it
live up to expectations and is comfortable
this stand is basically dead weight
its pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig
i said good not loud
find a youtube video to see all of its potential
the price is darn good as well
but626262it has true fender quality
this product has improved my productions beyond its price sold
i own the holier grail
its really cheap and the quality is good
for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do
for the moneyyou wont be disappointed
the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems
this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used
it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too
personally i love the nanoweb strings
the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition
thanks for a great product and good prompt service cheers
works well with polish on natural wood instruments
the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides
this is perfect love it
a great item at a great price
nice cable could be a little heavier
the simplicity of this mic is very nice
the fact that it is wide is nice
however they tend to come untuned because theyre so susceptible to temperature and humidity
you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy
luckily i bought the three pack
still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar
i did find a solution
this is one of them
i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones
i have replaced packs twice
one on the east coast and one on be west coast
i also have the ns micro and thats a better tuner
4 stars is my tops anywhere

this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics
we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom
the alpha is a great little interface
probably better than any other light strings ive bought
they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings
i got this after seeing many of my church friends using them
i absolutely love these picks
comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters
would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set
not sure what to do now
it feels great looks great and sounds great
they are not slippery which helps
theyre one of my very favorite effects honestly
this one is easy  buy it
sorry i dont like these as theyre just too big
my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close
i cant find a modern sm57 with a switch anywhere
its a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use
but at only 7 this strap is still a steal
each has a unique sound
to my ears it sounds quite good
for direct recording it does
it is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions
the bassman is another that is just off the charts good
i dont think you can go wrong with this one
phantom power would be nice then also
i like the black side and the soft leather side
fender really got close with the modeling
once down you can pretty much count on an almost perment mounting
the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient
these have been my favorite picks for decades now
a booster makes your signal louder
cheap case but does at least fit the guitar
this capo is worth the price
i am editing my earlier review
it does some compression overdrive eqing notch eqing and exciteing all in one pedal
i tried these strings on my zager guitar
its a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job
i rocked all night and loved the sound
i cant see how they could improve this at all
the others 10 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also
for the price and selection and results works for me
34youre not getting the right tone man
you get what you pay for
this little foot stool is really sturdy
i really really recomend this one
i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events
why bother sending it back
built like a tank im pretty sure it will out live me
now this is one great piece of kit
i havent measured signal throughput so i cant comment on that
this should be every bassistguitarists best friend
you can also reassign the presets to different effects
i should have had more faith in fender
i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal
so at 8 this is definitely a win
the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well
however adding a 10 for this item is worth it
im currently using the snark on my guitar
i dont require professionallevel equipment so this cord serves my purposes well
takes some hand strength to open it but you dont want a weak capo
the set is quite nice for the price
in this case it is a winner
my big nose cant confirm that
i liked the string spacing on these nuts
it is a standard length just like the sm58
i bought two sets of these for two of my fender 4x10 bass cabinets
line 6 offers tons of sounds
i will buy some more of these
dont see how they even afford to make these things for this price
it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar
they get better with wear
there is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the onoff switch
a pedal does not make you play better practice does
it literally gave me chills
do not buy  it is a wast of money
the weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock
not much of a chore
that was good enough to sell me
overall nice looking feeling guitar for a beginner
ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars
i absolutely love these strings
way to thick for me
still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased
these headphones are kind of classics
its almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing
always loved the sound of the bb
i would recommend them to anyone
compressionsustain wise this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise
the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd 500 are amazing
the mount has exceeded my expectations
one concern is that the linked power cables dont have anyplace to disappear into
it cost 99 and i figured i got less than what i paid for
nothing on the market works as well as this
i just decided to eat the loss
im planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case
i recommend you get this
anyway this thing sounds great
carefully adjusted to add littleno volume to the signal path unity gain
bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions
if it is not convenient it wont be used
why do i use them then
i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner
i paid 10 dollars for this
after using daddario strings ive try to ernie ball strings
its built like a brick and durable as all getout
the price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner
solid nice sound very good quality to make anyone happy except your neighbors
remember its a guitar tuner not an impact wrench
wish that it had a onoff switch but you can get around that
dava 6024 grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey
the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality
the tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price
youll only want the cover and footswitch if youre playing in a band
i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either
the adjustable parts are easy to use
the footswitch action is smooth quiet and nearly effortless
thus i give it 3 stars
unfortunately im going to have to return it
i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems
however the snark sn2 just has the edge
shell find the small stuff in her stocking this christmas
i believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs
it gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone
i am amazed at the great sn8
the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat2
i also purchased the ac adaptor since these things typically eat batteries
i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range
as for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree
fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway
the transparent rubber piece does the same job
it could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps
id also like to see another set of outputs on it as well
still have it and love it
but when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic rocks
you will get 2000 worth of use out of it though for sure
another tip   get a copy of yamahas sound reinforcement handbook
ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3
the people who hear us only hear us through their ears
there is no need to dl the fbv software for this
its just unbelievable how well this device holds picks
my experience with this little tuner has been perfect
the standard for mild nonoily instrument cleaners
i had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram
chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes
i bought an rp1 and it sounds much better
but i must say  so are these
long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time
all that said i still gota give the item its due
this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open
this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended
im a huge fan of these strings now
and im still waiting to hear back
this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank
i have many planet waves cables
so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd
my go to capo for years
these help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board
wanted it just on looks alone
okay i keep getting off topic here
and the overall look and feel is one of quality
im a professional musician playing 68 times a month
i like the g7th nashville capo but the spring tension is inconsistent
i like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic
glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin
everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm
the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described
thats the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal
but i guess its close enough considering the price
i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way
use this alot on all kinds of electronics
for 10 bucks this is great very sturdy and reliable
will order another set soon
not too heavy and very handy for traveling
while the product is everything it said it would be
theres a few schools of thought on studio monitors
that decision was based mostly on price
the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out
and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit
this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallowbodied ovation
love it and wouldnt wanna part with it
it seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it
nice and stable easy to change strings and lock tightly
one battery  this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other
there are also output adjustments as well
this little guitar stand works very well
i am learning to play the guitar
this quality bag would probably cost more like 35 at your local music store
it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully
i heard about these from a friend several years back
good buy for the cost
this arm hold the weight of a atr2100 microphone fine
highly recommended very happy with purchase
of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp
this is great idea to clean guitar strings
they are smooth and bending is a breeze
easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connecthold very solid
i like a rich tone with some high end but without too much 8216klang8217
i cant raise the volume above 1 in my house
an excellent speaker that i would highly recommed
my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case
the actual wire is under 834 long itself
it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in
i have used gibson polishes for 38 years
you dont care about a telescoping boom and2
you can simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel
the controls are accessible and easy to adjust
the ac3 does that job
do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal
tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs
its well worth the money
the choice is yours there
i sat down plugged it in and played a bit
i have yet to buy another set of strings
i neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect
just thought i let you know about that one
who doesnt need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right
sometimes they break but what pick light pick doesnt unless its nylon
daddario make the best strings out there
it sounds really natural and its easy to dial in a nice sound
i have no quality issues with them
eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one
im not a professional but have been playing for many many years
youll know its on by the tone change and the bright led light
these strap pins are fantastic
i would recommend this product
i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out
this is a great product at a good price
construction is fine and you can set it up in 30 seconds
you dont even need to hear it
these things work really great
practice time just got better for your neighbors
dont leave any room for modulation or other special fx
high points for the delays reverbs and mods
and i have spares for later or to share
individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion
if not you can find a lot better head stands
no issues and pretty sure i will never have any
great strap for the price
not too much but at least something
i have had 34swing trees34 for many guitars for years
these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used
i think this is a good deal
yet its durable enough even for the roughest of players
the screen is super faint
i was very impressed by this little guitar
i record songs in my home as a hobby
im just learning what i want and what i need
good padding for comfort i go 190lbs
i think i paid around 495 for most of the ones i purchased
you might only have 3fx left
thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings
the directions are in the package
like it was made from the same company but its not
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings
i cant recommend this tuner enough
the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work
this cable seems topnotch to me
the uke tuner here is gloss black and the snark2 is matte red
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine
good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point
of course that is 54 solid inches of stage front though
i opted to purchase the newer model korg tm50pw instrument tuner and metronome
it it isnt broke dont fix it
really cant go wrong with the ditto
i can get a kyser or something for fifteen bucks
i should have researched this a little bit more
my precious uku will always be protected and look good too
granted this was caused by me dropping it once but before it was fine
so no hope of expanding
its bulky but it works well
it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage
i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldnt really tell that much
of course its not too loud  thats the whole point
the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle
i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good
it is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier
but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk
it flashed a locked tempo but i really dont need that feature
those flimsy backless music stands are worthless imo especially on a breezy evening
as a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks
73 mm picks  i would consider them medium thickness
it is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar
the nodelay headphone jack is great
out of the box i was amazed at just about everything
easy to put on and take off
every one is superbexcept for this phase 90 the nonscript version reviewed here
almost all celtic music sounds great
the price was  awesome
i do not record music with it but i havent tried yet
im sure the screws are okay but i wouldnt trust them myself
the quality is good i would say  not great but not terrible either
first of all it is a beauty
this makes it very comfortable
if you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine
these are the only locks ill use now
buy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny
its one of the best purchases ive made in a long time
the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length
1 digital drumset 1 electronic guitar 1 microphone non xlr and a keyboard
this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right
sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time
sidenote  the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me
i like that the pedal has a wide array of uses
the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet
the more overtones an instrument produces the worse the tuner behaves
in the end they are all the same
i ordered two just in case
what i love about this pedal is the tone knob
very good deal for newbies like me
ive got a bunch of these little tuners i keep one with each instrument
i have a heavy touch when i play the guitar
i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor
i like it works really well
its easy to take on and off
this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver
i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition
i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there
it doesnt seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar
the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pfft
right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones
guitar is my primary instrument and i am a decent singer but not great
fuller sound with the 1046s buti cannot bend them like the 9s
if you bought rocksmith 2014 and use an electric guitar get this
i tune the a to 432 and this works well for that
bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesnt cost much
but thats not a complete comparison
it works but ill probably end up getting a better one
i would still recommend it though
this item is definitely in the good quality family
shure knocked this one out of the park
this is certainly a heavy duty stand
hes absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner
there are a few issues however
great value good quality and sound
a guitar is an investment and you should protect it
i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string
that increases their resale value so the tool pays for itself
i used this on a 5string bass
it did take some measuring to get this in place
it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well
but again for simple storageprotection its a nonissue
its pretty without distracting from the guitar itself
i need to have alot of pick speed
i play 12 nights a week in a midiassisted duo
the trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser
pros  works fastaccurate and can recognize full chromatic scale
no one can touch amazons price and service
it is alder and hefty but durable
not a whole lot to say about it
a good polish cloth is a must
took one star off for visibility
never had one unscrew again
i had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up
i recommend this one to anyone
it also has a dry through output
both sound good but these last a couple weeks longer
this is a very versatile tuner
there are two on settings  regular on and fx on
theyre made in the usa
at2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality
after a while it just stopped working
the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board
seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box
they come in three colors and the colors stand for soft medium hard
i may buy a second one as a backup
i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make
feel like its a tricky rebate
all in all a beautifully designed and executed product
all the capos ive had from kyser are still in great conditions
i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak
unless it was a cheap piece of crap
like others though i cant stop playing through this
i havent used the battery pack so dont know about battery life
ive been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years
i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies
i use one for my electric and another for acoustic
the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer
black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay
i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag
i have them on my luna 12 string and the sound is rich
well made and easy to adjust
very nice effects on both channels
works great if used correctly
and i no longer had to worry about the pick slipping
so make sure you try before you buy
no telling how long the switches will last
this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing
my son loves this polishcleaner
i would buy more if i needed them
this guitar support couldnt be simpler
it is a nice clip works for my mics
i am really loving it
it takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new
the stool is very sturdy no rocking no swaying no moving at all
i think it is reasonably priced as well
i use it in combination with motrya gold
i shall  probably get three or four more
i was shocked when i got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was
the dr600 was my first behringer pedal
great tone sustain and flexibility
now it doesnt worksame day i got it
theyre very inexpensive but seemingly quite high quality
the midi clock sync implementation is flawed
every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps
its powered via the usb
they stay in your fingers well
stravinsky violin concerto  anne sophie mutter from mutter modern
going to pick up the optional foot switch
the guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it
i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job
they are also very easy to use and 34install34
i bought one for myself as well and i do like it
possibility created by the multiflex feature and the grip
fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet
they are what you order
this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar
this is a very secure and almost comfortable
feels and looks good right out of the box
i do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom
it seems to work best with power chords root5th note and single notes
i imagine it would hold beer too
i love em use them daily and rely on them
but a real assorted pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors
aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal
this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised
im back to programming menus again ugh
that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it
its just about deadon with my korg which is extremely accurate
the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap
this microphone in just a few words is awesome
delay and chorus are also pretty good
i love the sound but i wont use it live in case of feedback
in fact i like it so well
but it isnt a huge difference
i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier
one of my favorite strings for my les paul
beautiful sound and very well made
it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks
i will not buy more
80 but i still like the tortex picks for that as well
the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster
maybe 5 times in my entire career
couldnt be happier with my purchase
really impressed with this wah
they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning
my fault but it shouldnt have broken so easily
i know some will disagree
the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better
much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem
the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar
best strings for my ukulele
i still like my line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain
not sure how a nonpiezo pickup would affect the tone
the strap is about 6 too short for my seagull s6 guitar
this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished
this is an awesome capo
most of the band members dont mind them
i think its worth a hundred dollars
goes up and down and tilts back
i like how it works
as an overdrive its great kind of a midsy marshally sound
it comes prestrung but it is out of tune
todays sm7b is the best noncondenser vocal microphone still in production
inexpensive to purchase  easy to mod to your liking
gorgeous strapped to my sons martin acoustic guitar
i works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables
also i like it more than the jj but the difference is subtle
only negative is i dont know how long it will hold up
its perfect for vocals podcasting video recording and so forth
it was a direct replacement for the original
i am a user of behringer products though own 2 of their amps
if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice
thus any uke that is concert size or greater
if your experience is like mine youll be very satisfied
this is my 6th joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint
make things easier and cleaner looking  thats what
the packing way below average
they last pretty long for noncoated strings and play nicely too
the best 29 that ive spent in a long time
inspires my ears to make music
so theres nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2
it is definitely better for thicker strings
my favorite is still the g7th capo
on top of all that it looks nice too
the tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great
adjustments for intensity and length
this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly
to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked
still have yet to mic up a drum kit
i bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles i own
perfectly happy with this strap
it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap
it works as it should and saves time
a less important issue has to do with the grain
this is what it shows a simple small mic stand that dont fall over
i write and record my own music
for everyone else it should fit pretty comfortably
works great with my fender super camp x2
i doubt youll be disappointed
i bought it for a very large body 34f34 hole electric guitar
actually it looks like used pedal not like new
guitar tuned easy and holds tune well
i have no complains about it at this time
so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least
im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard
while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and visversa
built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient
its too flexible almost like twizzlers no kidding
they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier
got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either
the description says the color is gold
although it does exactly what it says
maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb
the pitch shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun
this cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp
almost a perfect pic for me
this thing will test most all the cables a musician will use
i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem
took a bit to get used to but they are very playable
the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip
too long is better than too short
full range achieved from 6 to noon
none broken yet but i dont usually break strings
it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do
my larrivee rs4 came with these and converted me to schaller
a good purchase for a low priced capo
2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly
i didnt hammer the strings just played easy mostly the eagles
unlike other cheap chinesemade ripoffs ahem
you want that go waste your money on a line 6 or something
made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound
when you do 6 out of 10 times the plastic socket will break
i originally rated this pickup 5 stars
i think these are great for the price they give you
bought this amp probably about two years ago
and then the less than good
any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use
the other has some kind of short in it
the daddario exl110bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great
however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors
these fender qr knobs came in and looked good on my schecter
i do recommend this one
thanks d8217addario for providing an awesome product
a simple modification but bordering on genius
each light has multiple independent settings
it can hold the weight of any of my guitars
if youre even thinking about it just do it
the boss dd7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone
for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal
good sustain and strings are holding up well
the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture
sometime round 1994 my friend kendal built several of these for our band
good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets
easily stretched and tuned with no problems
ive used gls products before and they are good quality for a fair price
this is a great tuner
im using a fender jaguar this thing is married to it
they have become my favorite phones
this is not a gigging pedal
but only thumb picks work so i can use my fingers too
everything you need to know is in the title
awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use
the wound strings also seem quite stable
some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting
ive used my hde pickup for about a month now
i play guitar bass and violin
good value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount
this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful
they worked out just fine
thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia
the action is nice and low good especially for a beginner
nice work joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist
the chrome on the sides looks very cool
this is a great stand
that makes what seems like a lot 60 slots get filled up pretty fast
made in canada seems well built and durable
i laugh when ever i hear about the 34holy grail34 4558 ic chip
inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners
still trying to get the overblow
the first did not have a compartment door
you can google it for better instructions
the best xlr cables you can find
theyre noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummylike
they enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought
i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar
i like this one the best
this is great for adding pedals
it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard
i recommend the 7000 model
ive played guitar for 5 years
what it does  first a quick word about compression
any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally
they work well just need to be a little bigger
theyre gorgeous sounding especially when new
and if you goof and unplug it before powering it down no problem
the sc1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars
at least the ones i was sent
love it love it love it
the unit i received did not work
i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars
how do you review an sm58
this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box
it does the job well
this is a super solid price too
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box
still a great product its just a little flimsy
the item does what its supposed to
this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal
if it doesnt work you hate it
i like to hit things
the case is now entirely metal vs
now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners
there are a few strange nuances though
it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward
the bulkiness of this cabledoesnt seem to lend itself to easy coiling
holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get
it had been dropped on its head
they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time
get them if you like gilmour
this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played
its a very noncolored sounding overdrive
holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless
i regret this purchase for what i paid for it
does its job very nicely
a well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product
stretch them bend them and they dont break
these super light flexible nylon picks are great if youre trying to play quietly
maybe i just need a shirt with more cling
my 66 had thin frets
its an easy oninseconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets
high quality solid support and good design decisions all around
what surprised me was how it improved the sound
i am very happy with my purchase
three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility
they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what ive experienced
this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks
but this was a great package deal for this price
nylon has incredible strength but isnt very comfortable
as a spare cable to play at home though its pretty good
i put it on my stratstyle guitar and it works brilliantly
the only problem in my household is
i also really like the daddario pures
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
plus nothing could beat its price so get it
very well made and beautiful
my daughters love this amp and works perfect
this baby is worth every penny and i highly recommend it to any guitarist
the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards
once it does its beautiful music after that
still seems to be good quality
but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort
these are better and screw in
its kind of tough at first but with experience its very easy
but it sounds great with a tube amp
the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part
if i need another stand i will buy this one again with no hesitation
when youre satisfied just hold again to enter regular onoff mode
the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons
proper vibrato comes from the fingers
to hold it in place when in storage or transport
it works so great i ordered a few more
thats what i do anyway
the process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time
this pick is great highly recommended
im sure it will be amazing
the cutter worked great too
there is no onoff clicking when depressed
a fender aftermarket product that didnt come with some sort of defect or problem
the bottom clamp never did secure properly
personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal
these picks were a filler item for a much larger order
great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too
thats because its designed for making solos stand out
design looks great in the light too
arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised
the snark sn8b is my favorite so far
grip is the last thing you want on your strings
just one bottle of this should last years and years
i love this little tuner
they all had pluses and minuses
so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand
i ordered this strap to use with both my concert  tenor ukes
oo if you have a burkes outlet near you
weve used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity
nope you cantd tap tempo
i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan
it only says what the product does have
like my title says this gets the job done and is well built
it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble
capo is well made and is very well priced
depends on what your looking for
might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers
i really cannot recommend this bag enough
theres no resistance on that joint so it flops down
its a versatile light source and i really like it a lot
that did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids
the last and make playing a breeze
seems very solid but its always difficult to tell with cables
they look great and were cheap
this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations
may not power some pedals that have a high current draw
for now ill stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb
despite this installing them was quite easy
they have a long cord and ill talk more about it later
this is a good durable mount
di bass is the worst
nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar
i am very impressed considering the price
try it you cant go wrong
much more sturdy than it appears in photos
there are both xlr and trs inputs on the back
theres better ones out there
all my electric guitars are equipped with these
i could not expect a better violin stand
ive had the same tuner for years
i hope it goes away with use
the oval shape is perfect
and 20 for a levys leather strap is a good deal
its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely
this is a decent buy below the two dollar level
these are great did the job
at less than 15 you need to be able to look past these things
to be honest i have no idea where this is coming from
i like the dunlops feel grip and durability
i paid only 29 and it is small and convenient
the title says it all
propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar
got what i paid for
it means they need to be replaced
it is short but works with the small amp that i purchased
the finish on it is outstanding and id like to keep it that way
the guitar sounded pretty good
either way its losing another star
you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it
easy to set and adjust while playing live and onthefly
it is plastic but it suits my needs
great pick i recommend it
i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures
all and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference
the quality of the screen is very good
or even headphones that youd like to baby
for the price 30 shipped it cant be beat
2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars
this one blows that one away
not too big or not too small
they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings
either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly
these are good strings for a good price
very durable and light weight
andy said that this product is far superior to any other
for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the 30 price tag
and no i dont own stock in the company
this is a very nice guitar strap in light gray
i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music
one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile
xlr to xlr from mackie mixer to pylepro 1400 watt amp
not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out
now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me
i will not shy away from epiphone anymore
i have 100 confidence this will never tip over on its own
these are the classiest nicest looking picks i own
and with its length its plenty of room from your guitar to amp
call me a satisfied customer
best price online and the shipping was super fast
three key words for this  accurate  small  inbeat
ok quality and certainly better than a piece of rope
i use this pedal all the time now even more than the ds1
i like them so much i bought another one
you need this to get the most out of your superchamp xd amp
be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off
im happy with the tascam us 100
super sturdy easy to put intake out
a friend plugged it into his marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous
they should make a metal edition for that
i tried to tune it using a clampon snark tuner
upper fret access is really good
if you own more than 1 pedal and we all do you need this
plus the battery life is great
you probably already know what this thing is and what it does
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
it has a good range of overdrive levels
was upgrading the chrome on an mim
the color is a a metallic blue almost navy
easy to withdraw and replace picks
this one is a good meet in the middle of those two
good strap at a good price
ok  i like this one a lot
it is very similar to a guitar in many important ways
has a great sound in my opinion
no pedals needed with this thing
great buy i am happy with it
it offers rugged construction and true bypass
i used the schallers many years ago
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there
no dice so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots
it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it
note  the music stand easily detaches from the adjustableangle part for storage
pros extremely easy to use and widely compatible 62 no batteries required
focusrite should really have made a longer cable
i love the little thing
believe it or not ive yet to use this screen
i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse
use with power supply and not batteries
the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo
easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at least
this would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument
depending on your style these might be a good choice
love the security of having my picks within grasp
the neck is  well made
the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate
i have used it to hang a 12 heavy string
think the jimi blues cd
i wanted to experiment with a thin pick
the guitar rested too high for my liking
well made and just what i was looking for
15 to 20 dollars then sure
strings might look tacky but theyll stay on there if tied properly
a must for all guitarists
buyer beware for this kind of
the price was great and the wattage was nice
very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure
they all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers
it effectively quiets all my other pedals
really cool looking and are nice picks for the
needs little space another plus
the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect
i was surprised of how well this stand is made
silent onoff and i have two of them
its cheap and the quality its great cant complain
volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results
even if it doesnt save a whole lot of time its very ergonomic
i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic
not the greatest mic cable but for the price they cant be beat
i would not have been able to do that without this amp
great quality for such a low price
i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps
ive heard it compars to a fender tweed in tone
easy to mount solid grip on guitar
durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes
now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it
get one and have fun
they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do
save your money and order this through musicians friend
overall its good enough to buy it
i would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar
ive been making great recordings since
ive had to change a few batteries but they last a long time
out of most ive tried ive come across the big muff the most
they dont come with cables so be sure you have some available xlrxlr
ive bought an additional two since my initial purchase
for a number of reasons
it sounds much much better now
so many things i have developed
there are ways to improve the offtheshelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately
small amazing good quality interface
would i purchase this again
nothing sounds as bright as these strings
using for audio acquisition for film  video purpose
and it sounds great too even better than their wellregarded snowball series
the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used
it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play
the base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory
what else can you ask for
i must say in the beginning i was not thrilled with the product
its a very fat sounding cab sim
i thought id miss it but i dont
this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from
its sturdy and gets the job done
best inexpensive right angle cables out there
i guess i dont like the way the uke sounds when using them
it doesnt cost a lot
i havent tried this through a pa live yet
this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described
almost a gold but not quite
ive gigged with it and it sings well
totally unusable as far as im concerned
the display is large and bright
i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain
height adjustment was also important
it distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though
i am user that likes behringer products
the rest is just great
i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise
i want a refund plus an hourly wage
i find it stays in tune like a 34instrument34 should now
this one was a huge disappointment
you get what you pay for
even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar
it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks
i just leave it on my telecaster
the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate
i use them with azoom g1n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great
maybe its better under mac
with accessories tonal quality is typically important
youn name it i have tried it
you could drive nails with this thingno exaggeration
it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy
worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter
great quality casters for the money
i didnt need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
i will report back after three months
dont ask me how it works but it does
just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect
i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button
this pedal is a great delay pedal
be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes
now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer
the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated
just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices
they are some of the best drum sticks ive played
it does not come with a mic clip so youll need to get one
with these i found myself overshifting both high and low
as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and roadrugged
but that goes for all neck racks really
display is very easy to read and lights up nicely
im a seasoned player of almost 10 years
however for the price and purpose this a five star cable
these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords
these picks are great the best part is the 72 pack
this capo is one of the best made ive seen
ordered 6 and out of 6 i have exactly zero flat washers
the device tunes within 610ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner
it also arrived super fast
i did my research on this buy
check one out and youll want it
the red color looks nice
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
not that i hated them just didnt really love them
it can do subtle lowrate lowdepth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles
as far as amps that model vintage tones
these cables didnt disappoint me either
they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good
these are the only strings i will use on my les paul
overall i like the tones this pedal spits out
also use these on my taylors
if your a musician or want to be
they dont make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible
the strap ends are great but theyre not really secure
definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised
they sound just like i thought they would
i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering
i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike
fast delivery and exactly as advertised
you dont have to hold it or put it on your leg
this product isnt really one to review but it does what it advertises
these are the best strings ever
other than a great display and accurate tuning
this nylon pick has great play feel
super easy to use and a musthave for anybody who gigs out
still i cant fault its tuning prowess
you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders
great seller and fast delivery
bottom line  this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price
all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared
having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly
work great for my needs
mainly due to the low cost
these work much better than standard stamped trees
holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight
so if necessary give it a tryand more than one
i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under 200 new
wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe
strings make a big difference in any ukulele
will be buying more in the future
i wont rant about a string winder
ill be buying another one and trying it again
if youre looking for a creamy true bypass analog pedal then look no further
your strap is now locked in place
i bought this for my son and he loves it
make sure thingie outputs at least500 ma if you can
everywhere you read these are the strings to have
i have not found that to be true
the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged
it works on my pinky finger
makes me feel good inside to look at it
i just cannot get any octave sounds idk am i missing something
it has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance
i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs
i bought a planet waves 9v power adapter to go with the honey tone
regarding the sound it is unbelievable
this is exactly what i wanted
its a cheap box that works
i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar
it is no lightweight either
and the sustain is improved
its not stamped to be one so thats why im confused
ive seen more expensive cables and this one is so far great
for the price this is one great little dynamo
i really like this pop filter
when i want a more gentle muted tone i use dandrea pro 346
clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there
im pretty happy with this cloth
im pleasantly surprised with this cable
monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end
for the money this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use
i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them
but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument
you can use a capo with this instrument
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations
if you use any fingerboard treatment try this one
not good for palm muting
this also has a bolt on neck
of course there are plenty of other choices for that application
doesnt wotk with vamp 3
shipping was free and fast
i really like this delay
i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail
comes with a capacitor so thats a bonus
34 it really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing
this works very well for all of them
i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd
it works great and makes this unit portable
i have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud
and the tone is very clear
they seem to be made well made
but even so theres really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low
they play extremely well and last a long time
instead i got a decent set of
stand away from my guitar when im playing and singing
ive been recording professionally for 27 years music radio commercials and television mostly
great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house
the xlr out goes straight to your mixer
the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich
now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post
these are my goto strings
in the end its definitely worth the 120 i spent on it
i cant play real guitars
they project without sounding harsh or tinny
but for the price it does work a lot better
much easier and faster to change strings
its just soso in my estimate but in some cases soso is good enough
the boost combined with the 2 low bass eqs works wonders for low end
if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
i didnt even have to adjust it
you cant have too many adapters if you are a sound guy
right at the upper lip works well for me
it works perfect for those hard ps and strong s sounds
i am using it with a musicians gear music stand
received this item in good time
i would recommend this product to everybody
have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar
these really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars
as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average
even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end
i have a pretty crappy ear so i rely on it to tune correctly
gets close enough to fake it for a club band
also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek 5881s for jj 6l6gcs
this works just as good as anything else
hands down my absolute favorite pick
ive been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone
you cant go wrong with a brand name like shure
it is light sort of cheap etc
super tight and easy to lower
i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful
it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows
in my experience of course ymmv
i have the small version
i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use
i always keep a lot of these on hand
tried these on a whim
maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference i dont know
but i always wanted an original cry baby
on tune and back to playing
it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well
have recommended to several students
not a problem for me but it may be for some
i works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it
these strings did neither for me
thats my experience at least
if you can pick one up used like i did all the better
there is nothing worse than a bunch of outoftune loud guitar players
for the money you cannot beat these strings
i do not use a dramatic effect more or an evh setting for leads
i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere
its well made and not too expensive
planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior  can pay
i thought i could take the smell
i think its a wonderful and adequate musthave for any musician
thats a total of 12
adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect
for the money you can not beat this
i dont use them all too often because theyre a bit too stiff though
ive tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound
im a cheapskate and i cant go back to cheap strings
behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals
i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint
im still using my roland stomp box tuner
there should be a complete manual at least in pdf included with the product
buy it use it and be happy
the carbon copy is the best there is
what else can be said about aquila
i had them shipped to my business address
is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough
it gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price
the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time
if you set it at 10 or 11 oclock its plenty loud enough
i bought this because i got tired of looking up byear tuners online
fits my fender well looks amazing
if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise
next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by its specs
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position
not worth the time   to send it back to amazon
easy to use what more could you want
a small but effective little amp
not the easiest battery access ive ever seen
itll protect your mando just fine
they are as named very light
they also came with two velcro ties each
no fret noise or hums
i use to tune with an antique korg
i love this product it works great
of course it doesnt stay long because it tunes fast
needless to say im not very pleased
ive compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and its dead accurate
they work well but they are not mogami
i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement
its fine if no one hears you
the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
i suggest ordering some better ones
but it should do the job
i just put theplanet waves pwct12 ns mini headstock tuneron my stratocaster last night
dont miss out on this great deal
theres not much to say about this product except that it works
its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle
ive read where people are using bottle caps instead of these
theyve been stepped on and treated pretty rough
its not a riot but
i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to
definitely worth the reasonable cost
a little tough to get on
great sound and no wear after one session unlike the daddario strings
even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing
great great great great great great great great great
this tuner is easy to use
but i like it because its cheap light and it works
i play standing up 95 of the time so these are a necessity
i dont in anyway blame the seller
dont forget to remove it when you guitar is resting
so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented
i wanted the tales of brave ulysses sound so i went with this
2 all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit
these are niceand this was easily the best price around
this is the only complaint i have about these strings
no noticeable noise added to my ears
this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak
the small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling
the tone preservation is excellent and havent noticed any issues there
highly recommended for the price
highquality cable for expanding the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v power adapter
it is a pleasant addition to my home guitars
my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot
they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick
the strap and picks were an added bonus
comfortable and easy to adjust for length
theyre great for quick movement around the fret board
im thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin
there was one review that mentioned it isnt for female vocalists
secondly the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions
you will not be disappointed
i will definitely pick up more for my other axes
a google earth view of their addressed explained it all
now the x2 is my main amp
i dont know what else to say
you download the firmware and install via the usb port
its heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off
it works great on both very accurate and easy to use
it still would not install
dont get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should
i dont typically use the metronome feature but its nice to have it
for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around
good idea but it doesnt work
it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it
i came across these grovers
these are well worth the cost
as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach
i found the tongsol to give me the best tone over all
i have a similar one but it has blue fire on it
i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display
we will continue to use beefy slinky strings
the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy
i researched a ton before i bought this one
i bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar
even so it was a good quality button
i saw these baby on the road with maroon5s james
the sound from this sg is true to its big brother from gibson
the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before
now if only the price of pickupchics would come down
the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made
its a classic strap from fender
it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding
top is a bit wavy from buffing
que mas se puede decir
it records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models
the winder is a little awkward to use
theres no audio interface this affordable
i would buy another one if i lost this one
i use this on all my households guitars and basses
this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height
it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc
even plugged into my best preamps in studio
great vocal and guitar sounds
it has a remote to control it
it would be nice if there was a sound feature
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you
i plan on buying these for all my guitars
its important for my playing to not have finger noise
the plugs are of excellent quality also
i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc
three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself
the movable head is awesome
this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy
it is like an added bonus
nothing else i can say  take it for cheap guitars
it got here fast and was trackable
i have just receive mine just now
they are all better than the line6 every one of them
ive purchased many of these cables and ill be getting more eventually
very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks
im not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby
the other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that
i do not own that pedal so i can not fairly make a comparison
this is a fantastic little capo
mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe
there are also knobs for volume and tone
i will not buy any other cable except planet waves
dont quote physics to me
some of the drives are usable
product was delivered safely and promptly
tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my sg
simple to use works well on the squier strat
when laying empty it is 50 long x about 12 wide and lays flat
comes with a 14 inch adapter which is nice
metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must
the 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound
this is the best capo around and works great
sweet sound with an older fender amp unit though
it will save you a fortune
there isnt too much to say about it
that being said dont let that detract you from buying this
i think amazon had the best price
had for over a year hasnt failed
but i did have to give up tube amp option
still evaluating how that will work for me
it can it does and its cheaper than i can still believe
i connected it with mixer alesis 8 input
the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets
i have had some last a few years
the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom
plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper
it makes my guitar feel secure
works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish
i have two of these and i use them
i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well
this is easy to remove
if you own special 20s then you already know how good they are
who said santa was a scrouge
but i stand in front of a mic on stage
it fits my jasmine well
first off im a big fan of daddario strings and their planet waves division
this works just as good
this little guy fit the bill
so far it has been wonderful for intonationinitial setups
these picks are nice but just  too small
on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series
i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by
the planet waves capo trumps mykyserin both speed and ease of use
works if you keep it with instrument in your case and upkeep is minimal
this can be used to  semi  record music too
i just needed this for my new guitar
its clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife
looked at a lot of cases most priced 90 or above
great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection
if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it
this one works almost like a mist
perfect for restringing your guitar
so far im getting quality recording results from this board
as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value
sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side away from me the player
i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good
ive read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also
i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great
very high quality and a sleek look
we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it
wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars
it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use
these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar
definitely will buy mogami from now on
the mxr phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen
the beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loop
the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built
did you think you could fool all of us out here
ive been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago
i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree
the base strings feel really strange when sliding
however there is one problem ive had with it
the product description says 6 inches right
these are high quality picks
before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen
this board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply
as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved
i purchased some others to try
how do i know that youre wondering
leave it in the office
i bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap
these pick are cutting edge
a good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks
i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements
this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price
pot lockwasher nut and cap are what is included
im a firm hosa cable fan
very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker
it costs 5 or less delivered
im back with my wood block and am happy
this also works well for mounting on microphone stands
and i can even hold onto it
great surprise as i never took rogue seriously
updatetwo years in with continued regular use
great price for a carbon copy pedal
it came in perfect condition
bought a second set from dougs tubes ruby el84czs select matched jjs
it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner
wish i had sized them before i bought them
just what i needed to position my guitar while seated
start to feel scratchy this is a quick fix until youre ready to restring
the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing
and i have to say the aqua color is major retro
my main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate
this one is perfect in size and price
it looks like it will last too
the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does
it arrived intact and ready to play
the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about 18 inch
my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale
for most singers it will be just what they need
i will preface this review by saying that i am no 34audiophile34
i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsalpractice type combos
pup plate maladjusted and off quite a bit
the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy
this set of daddario chromes is remarkable
it is ok but it does not compare to the ergo holder
ten bands is a little overkill for guitar
hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal
it comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos
btw this seller really got these to me fast
it is very safe for guitar finishes
makes a great practice room amp
i couldnt even get the software to load on my 2013 imac
i only meant to test it when i unpacked it
five stars all the way
i am very happy i did
nowafter i did this it is sweet
i have to type more
the latter offers the now popular xz mic configuration but theyre fixed mics
i prefer gold or silver rings at the end
i will buy another one of this
decent stand as long as you arent abusing it
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard
this fixed the chibson tuning issue
at least not with the mic boom there
there is absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks of any kind
it fits beautifully and powers all of them at once
this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it
great precise tuning with the sn2 versus the other snark versions
i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables
went together perfectly and i really wanted it
currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount
one is the bright blue light indicating 34on34
it really made playing easier for me
the sound is short with a very high tone pitch
the adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees
its a loud 15 watts
thats all there is to say about it
its also more than just a dp008 with more tracks
these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost
i like the sound and feel of these picks
moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise
anyway these are great guitar picks if youre looking for something solid and longlasting
ive seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz
plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck
it comes in different colors also
basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer
dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up
its extremely sensitive slightly more so than the snowflake
its called train your people
this is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money
this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal
yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that
nice materials and i think it will be durable
i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound
i have a fulltone ocd after the zoom
as far as a cv controler
steelstring dreadnought archtop jazz box and les paul worked nicely
does fine on hard floors
so whats not to like
not much to say here but is really nice to have around
you know what i mean if you are a professional
luckily i had extra and this didnt bother me that much
includes screws and 1 washerfor the jack
i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present
looks really cool and sounds great
they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive
the unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument
i cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up
i am sending them back
its a good product works well and does what its meant to do
the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it
im not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with
very easy to install as compared to other systems
the pedal is quiet and solidly built
overall this is an extremely wellmade tool for your guitar kit
these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently
it was even sorta in tune
buy a clipon tuner too
one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type
i do not regret this purchase at all
for stage i like something heavier
ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment
the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic
the ab switch is kinda a nice touch
it fits easily into all the recording equipment im using
we are a perfect match pizza and me
this is a good product
i have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars
my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it
two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up
its a stand it does what its supposed too
like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele
as capos go this gets the job done at a good price
just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice
once you place the pedals on it its kinda heavy
this tuner is a real good buy at a good price
it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for
then theres the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadnt considered
no but sounds pretty damn good
it has a wide tone range
for my homestudio purpose i like the warmer sound of the pm05 more
big mistake it deadened the sound terrible
it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
loose grip little sweat slick finish
this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase
like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points
this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund
the cord is reliable and clean sounding
if you want a tuning challenge the low bass e string is it
for electronics the voltage has to be correct
overall i give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter
i recently went electric again after 20 years
fits great easy onoff easy adjustments
thats really all its designed to do thus 5 stars
it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls
i like tremolo but its virtually useless in this unit
it provides at extra layer to reduce the ps fs ts etc
im looking forward to learning more about this pedal
so far the behringer uca 222 is working great
best clip on tuner i have ever purchased
great price but very fragile
i record at 48k  16bits in
not completely gone but lessened
this is a review for themahalo u30pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink
i recommend it a lot
id prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it dont
like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it
the file is saved and then you can push playpause to listen back
if you see a price drop below 495 dont buy
the rest will just play as if the effect was off
edit 20130407  still working fine
wasnt expecting much for this price
ive been using this product for months now and have no complaints
this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations
all in all this is a great pedal
these are only good for garage practice on a budget
they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables
the 34hall34 setting is phenomenal
the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell
i have two of these
for the lower price you get black plastic
do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings
they look great it is indeed real ebony with a pearl inlay
now im glad i chose this one
the finish is beautiful and i found no defects
i used an 1164 drill bit for the pilot holes
it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them
easy to plug in i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband
it does not hypnotize beautiful women
the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp
053 and high e and b each increasing
original reviewi have had similar tuners in the past
when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar
i plan to buy more of these in the near future
the accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings
im a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables
installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they wont do magic
havent had a problem until now
everything you need to keep your guitar clean and polished and sexy
well i want to clear this up once and for all
it was only about 15 at amazon and worth many times that amount
i purchased this case for my newline 6 pod hd 500
and i dont even like digital
super great sound and super long life
i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely
just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair
speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice
i would definitely buy them again
works just as i need it to
so i thought it would bea good opportunity to try a 34nonstandard34 strap
i know it will perform
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac33 acoustic amp
there are better tuners out there
the tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar
exactly the same as describe here love the sound and easy to play
it was an intellitouch that worked if not perfectly then a whole lot better
its perfect for 23 acoustics and 12 electric guitars
definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that ive come across
no buzzing on the strings when i put it on
they are excellent quality clear tone and a great look
but it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultraportable
you cant view the snark sn4 at any kind of sharp angle
i highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others
cons  so far none and i dont expect any
i am liking these more and more as time goes by
wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables
small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading
the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up
super simple to install and very sturdy once installed
so much for magic elixir tone
i honestly cant say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal
worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard
but it does a good enough job for what it is
always high quality for a reasonable price
id recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like
that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm57
no this is not the same as actually being loud
it has a nice resonant sound good playability and very attractive finish
this is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price
i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great
its quite the perfect height for when im seated on my stool
just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need
the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too
it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings
i tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much i like them
i was able to get great marshall like tone out of it quite easily
ive been playing daddario xls in their standard
but this is the original and the best
so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat
i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer
cant argue with that track record
the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on
i use this pedal in my pedal chain
these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing
it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play
this is an awesome analog echo effect
very high quality microphone stand
i have two of them
my use is relatively narrow  kick drums and amps
this pedal does exactly what it says its supposed to
upon comparing the resulting  cds
my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capos design
these are great patch cables especially for the price
however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock
it is all i want or need from a stand
everything else plugs right in
ill probably get another one
i have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder
again i was very happy with the results
i like having the variety though
of course if it can accurately handle 8s it will breeze through anything thicker
these are the best topping any other by far
the exp16s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic
no more need for a pedal based tuner
i ended up using that pick for something like 3 years playing 12 timeswk
one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet
looks like a whole new guitar now
i loved it very much
quality seems top notch design is simple and effective
they now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar
the battery cover on mine fits very loosely
you  might pay more for a name brand case
was transferred to a dept
i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic
it also is easy to store when finished
i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal
self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp a real nice feature
i love its size and portability
i havent noticed any sound issues at all
im sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a tingting
capacitor are a nice generalized  choice
this works in some applications but doesnt work in many others
i have purchased several amps over the last 7 months see the reviews
i am using the other 5 and they play very well
these mics are the best mic for the buck out there
the board itself is built like a tank and travels well
the level knob has a lot of juice
is this the best distortion pedal
the only problem is that the effect wears off quickly
ive had this for several years
i feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing
i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension
i dont often use a pick for my soprano uke
what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string
it does what it is suppose to do
it looks very stylish and functional as well
item works as advertised very easy to hook up
its supposed to be very reactive to your playing
ive tried all 3 types of these and theyre pretty much asadvertised
i bought this to tote my pod hd500 around
the brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission
this is a very useful guitar compressor
and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer
took awhile to get used to but really liked it
check these things out you will not be disappointed
it really doesnt affect play at all so it doesnt matter
just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar
yup its ok  nothing special
other than that i like the pockets and overall design
luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these
i started with the flimsy grays
im pretty impressed with it
this is the most awesome loop pedal ever
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
they do make noise kind of like an old album
it works on vibration or mic so its very versatile
its not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are
martin makes great sounding strings
i dont know why people think this isnt sturdy
these strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings
the truss rod was completely loose
no 15watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings
but once i got it locked in ive never touched the knobs again
this is the only reason i gave them four stars
im also going to put on some elixir light strings
well constructed with quality woods saddlenut and bracing
i like that feature alot
its what they do and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal
i get long life and very good clarity from daddarios
ukulele straps are a rare thing and ive yet to find the perfect one
makes even first tuneup easy
mine came flattened in a little box
some may disagree but im convinced
this thing is a beauty
and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful
its just a matter of how much you want to or can spend
i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar and what a difference
to the people complaining about it falling over
a great product no matter what gauge string you choose
its a great pick holder but im not fond of the sticky background
at first thought it was broken but batteries were  not sitting in right
its a guitar strap it does the job and looks good
the package instructions are correct but not very helpful
if you are a satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining
new strings have never been easier to install
this was recommended and i am happy with the product
stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock ping tuners
these are really well made straps for the money
they feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard
my loyalty is certainly not shaken
none has ever failed me so far
different materials produce different soundsfeels
would buy it again if stolen as they say
easier learning bagpipes than these things
this is now powering my entire effects board and its doing a great job
it has led lights to follow as well as a meter to use
anyway  no reservations about this one
thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded
i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul
if you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here
use it with an sm58 shure mic in a studio type application
i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them
it works with all of them
plug  play with windows 8
i gave it 4 stars on just expectation
that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy onoff
your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings
this is a roundwound string with a hexshaped core
but it can also my blueridge br180 or my seagull s6 coastal spruce
theyre especially wonderful because theyre battery operated
i also really like the nylon material
great as a booster as others have said
other than that its a good deal for the price
for the price cant beat it
the products work great applied them to my new les paul ukulele for protection
they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice
perfect whether youre rocking a featherweight strat or a 16pound 6string bass
got to me in two days
the bullet is nice but i outgrew it
that was not the case
but i did buy this for rock band
remember  because of the material you will notice a slight difference in sound
what can you say about rosin
its built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand
a lot of students cant read or notice such small type
i will never do that again
but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here
playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking
but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone
works really nicely at limiting background noise
the other two tuners dont have this issue
and most are planet waves already
and if you know the g chord you will have lots of fun
i have a heavy epiphone eb0 bass and this strap is a lifesaver
thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of five
first i want to make clear that this is a dark bassy pedal
good strings help create good sound
when i first started playing i loved the coated strings
it makes my guitar look new again
it is not so tight as to fatigue but the response is positive
still use it for practice and wont change it
it was priced right  750 usd
im a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play
you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic
i really like the 38 second looping function
the wire gets stressed at the mic clip andor plug and shorts out
works well for my needs
i would recommend these to anyone
the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot
you must have one of these
i would recommend getting strap locks
he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product
part number  83cb made in usa
these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price
best articulate bass string for the money
i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another
for general home use though i wouldnt worry about it too much though
which is not expected at this price point
its made me check out other audiotechnica products
nice soft flexible leather and very adjustable
the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible
the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well
i like these nickel on my tele
95 of the time this will take care of the problem
cheap and convenient iam not disappointed
once configured however its been solid
for 100 if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well
i always felt 100 secure with these straplocks
what you put into the input comes out the same only louder
they are not too stiff or too flimsy
could be my system could be the preamp otherwise no complaints
still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery
010s in stock as well as over a dozen
the c1 is probably the most universal of all the models
it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too
i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice
it has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesnt
when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked
perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets
i use the 21 cable
this tascam interface works great with pro tools
behringer is a problematic company for me
the second one arrived with a low battery
hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point
it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible
not much you can say about these theyre knobs
the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp
at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot
i dont notice much difference at all though
i can deal with it
i will be selecting solely on price
i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it
but then i read how you use it and all that
of course if youre running a chain of drivedistortion pedals youre asking for it
i have used ernie ball strings for along time
i received it and the first thing i did is try it
they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck
i recommend these picks without reservation
much cheaper online too for the price its a steal
73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick
a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark
great cord for the money
it fit perfect and gives the fender name to a saga kit guitar
the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights
i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solidbody bass
i needed some fretboard cleaner
i like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around
a couple years ago i switched to yellows
these have good shielding not like the others
it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway
so far this cable has worked very well
this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric
the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps
they work fine for me
regarding the item itself i am bit lukewarm
this is the best case ever for the money
i took a look at it and knew i had to have one too
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
but its just not for me
these strings sound great plug and unplugged
this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals
if it will reach its great
so much sustain for a bolt on neck
i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus
the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly
that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable
the sm sounded muted compared to d5 without any sound modification out of box
i was warned about the shielding but i havent experienced an issues yet
this is my goto guitar
it will not dry out and lasts for years
its small enough that you can leave it on in the case
guess ill have to stop eating cheetos while im playing  just kidding
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours
as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal
bought it as a gift
arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait
this combo is very rare
either that or theyre comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue
people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm58
i dont use any of the other features
to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat
i recently built a bass myself and i install this one
reading the product description may give you an idea about this product
got this because i thought the length would be enough
for the price this mic is a very good deal
but as far as sound they are great
needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag
i recently picked up an 812ce first edition 12fret
i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos
had another brand that stopped working and replaced with this
i prefer them at 90 degrees so these are just right
i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china
oops there goes a star for the con job
so really i just use this for the wire cutter feature
the price was right from amz
it costs more but has more functional value to me
the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch
i paired this up with the ma400 and it works great
havent had any problems with it at all so far
works great and base is out of your way
the idea is good and its cute
i even like it with the bass
10 minutes it took for all 4 strings
its now my go to amp in the studio
the 48 is made in mexico
it works really well and its really thin
like other kk pickups it sounds darned good
i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions
i didnt think id use it much but i do
i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else
this is a great buy under 100
nice foot switch for the mustang amp
its just a plastic clip and anything can fail
im building a speaker cab with a jensen 6 speaker just for this amp
so you are getting what they say
good length but very slippery
finally settling on this cherry burst lp100
im a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me
if youre looking for massive distortion keep looking
if you can you should try on holders before you buy
why didnt i think of this
i dont think you are gonna find a better microphone
this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly
works as expected and should last a really really long time
i can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail
both ended up in checked luggage
i also have purchased several red blue and the new super tight tuner
so if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration
this is so supple to the touch making playing with it a great experience
got them in 3 days and love them
inf file that is important
turn in half way up you get a clean sound
i just got these in and i have to say very disappointed
id still not abuse them too much though
their mic stands and guitar stands
i now have these tuners on an american strat and an american tele
but this mini tuner is just plain amazing
the tone is great they8217re durable and smooth on the fingers
it was to be shipped from japan
i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily
i put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less
i highly recommend this tuner
only thing that was slightly upsetting is that i only received one screw
from playing and singing piano recording guitar and vocals and other various positions
any smaller and it would be going in the trash
great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks
i am not a fussy person about guitar strings
i have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio
this is an amazing guitar for the price
they are what i needed
ive been using these for years
using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
btw im an average grown man 57 165  more to come
i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100
so when i needed more strings i just got fenders
it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing
gls audio 25ft mic cable is very high quality
this cable is built to last
this stand folds into a pretty small package but supports the guitar very solidly
the h4n is a great versatile field recorder
after getting these the game picks them all up now
i notice mixed reviews here
they always give me consistent results
they will last forever if you take care of them
my setup is a very simple one
theyre not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience
these went on with no problems
the electronics themselves have held up admirably
fast and reliable and accurate
looks good but disappointed that they arent made in the usa
notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock
this instrument might actually be in a class of its own
good news   these aquila strings are on most new ukuleles
it stopped working after 2 gigs
im borderline skinny and it still wont fit
they have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want
i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage
it doesnt come with the cord what a surprise
once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product
can slide and play much smoother with this
it sounds so much nicer
it arrived on time and was as described
if you dont run a 4ohm speaker you wont get all 20 watts
my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds
we did notice a scent but it didnt bother anyone
im very pleased with this stand
what else can be said about them theyre good picks
it is cheap so you should just get one
especially when i bust out the old tascam 4 track cassette
fender start appears to take the system wellonly time will tell
com when i did and will not part with the amp
i like a flexible pick and these at
nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery
i will need to look for something else
ive always used the competition
the arms are adjustable  stay where you put them
not my first intellitouch tuner
they were tinny and clangy sounding
im still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood
comes with the screws and the 34cotton34 washers so you dont scratch the body
it does not tell your boss to give you a raise
all it needed was tuning
its just as good as any i love the joyo pedals
the interference went away after a few minutes
the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable
a real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses
i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand
clean and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely
still looking for the right picks for me
fresh strings can do a lot for your sound
just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery
it does that my dial is set at 10 oclock
i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application
was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash
it either cleans or it doesnt
i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer
if youre a bass player and use a pick you need one of these
but when i am winding new strings it often slips off
thats a subjective thing i suppose
if youre a purist dont ever use a pedals or even electric guitar
so far forget to use it but that will come
it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful
but in no way matters
ill be buying another one of these
i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge
the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze
these are descent quality cables
i do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic
daddario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for
one minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least outofthebox
better strings are worth the extra cost
and after 30 years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished
its easy to set up and easy to take down
very happy for the price
easy to screw it on the wall
they also wont mark up your prized instrument
i have several of these capos one for each instrument
then i saw this one
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated
no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music
for a nice strum these are fine
i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal
it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings
i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport
the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording
this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer
no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested
convenient storage is its biggest plus
if you own a guitar this is the best product out there
the box is ultra solid
if anything this pedal is as good as new
the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
you can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks
then it stopped being recognized at all
i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband
for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup
i play either a martin ae thru it or a strat knockoff
plenty loud for your bedroomofficewhatever
but all in all i will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort
works with the new mic my daughter got for christmas and nice quality cord
we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered 2 more
then i found this for about 100 and i immediately sprung for it
im a real klutz with my cords
it seems extremely rugged again like boss pedals
paid less than half through amazoncomgreat product that works very well with nitro finishes
provides everything i need from a mic stand
its more easier to pick the string
i bought this recently and i love it
direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring
its not a deal breaker
these are perfect for a fastpaced style of picking
it also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etc
i use fender 150ls and with it the longevity doubles
the first two are pretty heavy and bulky
but i should have known that going into a 6 double right ended cable
personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103
the depth of  sound sounds great
be careful out there people
guitar will never fall off a strap
he would definitely purchase this product
then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town
but for me and the way i play
but give behringer credit for providing a manual
it sounds fine no issues
providing the brackets to mount
these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy
this is the american dj micro galaxian red  green laser
both picks have their own unique tonal character
then i thought this thing cant work very well but it does perfectly
i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
they last for a real long time
the 5star ratings must be from employees
i didnt need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed
i had to sand it down some in all directions
i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while im playing
job only took about 15 minutes
steel will wear down your frets a lot faster
i do believe the folks at planet waves have developed the best capo ever
locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar
great guitar string at a reasonable price
cant tell if its truly working on my maple wood ukulele
for a few bucks more ill stick with schallers
it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd
there is no doubt about it national fingerpicks are pretty much the standard
i returned the skb ps45 and got the pt2 as a replacement
does that make me a gear snob
and this amp is so accurate that i can
most under 400 guitars dont have good pickups so why spend extra money
everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable
anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole
id suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand
warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive
this is a great buy
lets face it in general string winders are pretty much all the same right
i first picked up a transducer for about 3 and experimented
i dont know if its just mine or is something inherent in this pedal
okay my pros and cons
so they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables
with this set up the second channel will distort a bit
that helps you understand a lot
you will not be disappointed
these guys did a super job getting them here fast
i will have to replace it soon
i applied a lot of force to pull the cord out
it is a good value
best strap locks ive ever used dunlop has always had great products
the best tuner for your board in my opinion
and the es57 is equal to the shure sm57 at 6000 less
recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar
but you will get over that once you see how long they last
anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful
i would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun
cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue
much more fun than a black box
the jack was visibly wiggly too
i always use the 100mm for guitar had to test them with bass strings
the leg that you can use to prop this up isnt very usable
so although my cleans sound good they arent great
for fun i added one of the tomsnare mics and they sounded equally clear
i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality
id buy another in a heart beat
i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster
works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation
save your money and get some harps that actually work
i think it ends here
no buzzing and crackling and no more wires
gibson les paul with bigsby
build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten
this capo works very well
i couldnt have hoped for more from these stands
really this is a keeper
this tuner the snark fits on my godins small headstock with no problems
a very nice pick both in feel texture and design
i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one
i totally recommend this product  you wont be dissappointed
the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain
bought this cover to go with behringer mic
i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up
my mic200 and mic800 are much better than this
once you8217ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play
i stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good
this is my 1st gator case and im very pleased with it
for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this
this is a great product and i highly recomend it
you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response
you do not need usb to get this to work
ive purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work
fits the instrument and old mexican acoustic and feels comfortable
thats doesnt leave much room for tone tweaking so tweakers beware
not as a professional tube driver but quite well for the price
i didnt like it cause of the squealing
i hear it can be used on other boss and roland gear
every guitar ive ever cared about has had this strap on it
i would also by the dunlop lemon oil as well
the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone
you shouldnt be disappointed with this item
it is a great reliable tuner
if not for the hum it would get 5 stars
it recognized the devices presence but it didnt produce any sound on the computer
disclaimer i would only recommend the nanoweb not the polyweb
i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely
they are lighter than i expected
super fast shiiping  through amazon as always
it does what it is designed for
i have no recommendations for a volume pedal
buy one youll use it youll love it youll be happy you bought it
really i cant tell that they do
as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable
this is more of a toy than a good pickup
great for what i needed
for the combination we have these are outstanding strings
works great so far and dont regret purchasing
this is why i give only 3 stars because is to small for me
great harmonica rack for smaller harps
you literally cannot find a better guitar for 150 than the special 2
my initial impression was somewhat mixed
for the price you cant go wrong
besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss
bottom line  dont follow leaders
i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone
im happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings
filter works very well and looks professional
im used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly
its supposed to be 7 lbs
i like the way they sound
dont be in a rush
i even use it when im drumming
one channel 8 does 9v with 500ma sounds great right
i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome
impressively clear recordings unlike any ive been able to obtain using aplantronics
i have several mxr pedals
i always recommend all kyser capos
most definitely one of the best 34bangforyourbuck34 acoustic guitars
before supply and demand kicks in
its easy to put on and take off
so this was my first real tuner its very simple to use
i would highly recommend this to you guitar players
im very pleased with the pedal and couldnt be happier
it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism
hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks
not to mention the bargain basement price
if you play mostly standing this is the guitar for you
sure its a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it
i love the sustained bright tone
i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport
this is a really nice music stand
i am always very careful when turning the 34head34
ive read some negative press about behringer pedals but personally cannot complain
better go back to the diapason
i teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner
5 stars for what they are
not really worth the 75  i returned mine
purchased a pack for my playing buddy
hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off
no more misplaced or lost picks
thought i would give them a try
its definitely the best verb its price range
classic is a slightly lower gain more midboosted sound
not recommended for band environments
this strap is value for money
i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes
it also works great for a guitar
the price is great and it works
if you use all four fingers buy two sets
on the plus side for soloing you cant go wrong with these
the quality and durability are there 100 well worth what i paid for
which brings me to another minor complaint  no linux drivers included
arrived as expected very solid great fit
otherwise its a good idea
the adjustable stand also works great and wont fall on you or anything
it works well with cleaning spray
will order again if needed
i mean very loud radio background and i couldnt get ride of it
good grippy picks for some types of playing
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money
what more can i say
well designed and made from descent enough materials
they last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular noncoated strings
bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am redoing
switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull
it does its job and its well worth the money
a buddy of mine got one and hes killing it on the bends
havent tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too
i also own an olympus ls10
and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time
a very 34different34 sound range than round wounds
rocks my world and back to the garden
some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic
with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from
sorry yamaha but facts is facts
what to expect  with one drop the effect is immediate
you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer
you wont be disappointed with this amp
i just got it and tried it out
the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volumewah 2in1 pedal
this mic is good considering the price
still have my effects rack
worked out of the package and was cheap
it works well at all heights
its soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat
thats 5 stars in my book
10 mm is the perfect thickness
the mc401 on the other hand doesnt color your tone at all
plugged in it really shines
i dont even touch my morley anymore
and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure
whatever engineer was in charge of this  you screwed up big time
but i mostly play punkhardcore and blues which is does very well
havent used enough to see if images wear well
great quality very strong and great variation of length on them
they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it
its super cheap and i dont mean the price
i bought a bunch of these when i started building my pedal board
still has some orange peel but not a lot
has more low end and a smoother mid that the ocd
but then id go buy another one
this tuner looks nice and works great
this pedal is solidly built and works as advertised
the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs
this is my second case from them
i also have the trombone and saxclarinet stand from them
hand angle can also play a part in this
i put one in each of my guitar bagscant live without it
i use it now to get sort of a leslie effect
keep on hand to help understand theory
you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap
i have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes
good little tuner at a steal of a price
they seriously look brand new
in fact i have already bought them several times
i highly recommend this item
wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass
the unit itself is great
handsdown i like the dunlop ones more
will only need a minor setup
i like it so much that i ordered three more
dont lose the wing nut though
i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming
i decided to use light martin strings
buy this with confidence  youll love it
if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment
but they most certainly are not
heres a link to an ab comparison i did with an sm57
these are great little tuners
they seem to be decent quality
the box is a solid cast metal box with a very heavy metal base
the strings keep their tone for a long time
about half have worked great the other half have this odd little issue
and the action is now so smooth
i got this strap just to try something different than a nylon
sensitivity is good and im very pleased by this purchase
this is a professional wireless system
the price is good i bought it locally for the same price here
i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg
ive tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass
all in all these arent bad
the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works
its less than ten bucks
this board is great no sliders which i had to clean
one less accessory in the little bag now
always getting the question34can i hook my keyboard into your sound board34
i feel like it is a bargain at any price
it is thinner than a normal uke about half the body depth
colors help keep track of what is going into where
i solved the battery problem by using a 1spot 8outlet pedal power supply
i have purchased several snarks of all different types
phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap
not much to say about a guitar strap
the demos on their website show how simple it is to use
ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing
it didnt work very well but it is what was available to me
really though its quite good
it gets a great sound right out of the box
the cables are flexible quiet and no pops or loss of signal
i have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon
ive had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite
its not for professional use
they are made of plastic after all
very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep
but if you like to go deep youll love the fender fuse software
go no further for your volume pedal needs
no humm so that is a plus
ill be buying and recommending these for a long time
your h2 wont die during recording because the batteries give out
loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of naturalsounding distorted tones
if u have hand problems  try these
at least for a few weeks
i was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so
well what can i say
its lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory
i bought this because someone told me they really liked it
it does all that the advertisements say it will
affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingcons  this model is one compartment
this is thus far a good bargain
also with its size and brightblue color its anything but a stealth machine
it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultraeasy to use
it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock
this is just the tuner i was looking for
maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action
i use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar
this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost
ive dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubberylike casing
the cutter even works well
all this pedal does is perform volume swells
it has switches so each input can be a linein or microphone preamp
and the medium light set is just perfect
but maybe its just my small kidlike hands
but with a little trial and error i figured it out
they hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out
these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price
the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder
plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ x2
if its there i missed it
the contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality
this was exactly what i needed
i use this short stand for micing my guitar amp cabinet
i got this because of the price
sometimes the simplest design is the best design
these hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs
it is small and incredibly light weight you almost cant tell that its there
its nice having all of the tools on one device
these do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior
would i buy this yes if i didnt try anything else first
mine opens and closes ok and the lock works
even from some big makers
it runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9volt power supply
theres nothing rinky dink about it
great picks for beginners and pros alike
now anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise
but in our case it works beautifully
very nice resonant and clean
it probably stretches 1012 feet if you really need it too
they are plastic and will wear out someday ill buy another pair then
i just did my 3rd weekend with the same set
picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks
who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place
this guitar is pretty good for the price
i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics
i spent a lot of time on amazon reading reviews  comparing prices
small but well lighted screen
i play guitar mandolin and ukelele
they really are well shielded against rfi
the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off
so i am a happy camper i did it right
i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality
for home use it is fine
these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment
bought these to replace some gold ones on a les paul clone
if i want better i would shop around and pay more
they stand out too much
theyre my favorite picks and i always buy the medium ones
materials and labor all look good to great
wish i would have known about it sooner
mostly it goes in a pocket
this design works best for me
holds neck lightly  easy up easy down
sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo
fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one
this is worth the investment for your expensive mic
best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off
i use harmonica holders for kazoos
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
im using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement
even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the 5th star
if i had it to do all over i would save my money
i like the unique pattern on this thing too
that being said i dont play heavy at all
several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning
my previous tuner was a korg ca40 and frankly that tuner is terrible
its pretty hard to mess these up
mediumheavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold
i choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me
im convinced even heavier loads will be no problem
the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison
i just bought a zoom g5 and it works great with that
sounds like a million bucks
not one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night
love it love it love it
this pedal adds that i dont know what to your sound
it helped some but didnt get rid of the noise entirely
the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent
my father is a fulltime gigging musician primarily on steel guitar and telecaster
they do the job and they feel great
it is fast enough to use real time during intonation practicetraining on fretless bass
you could do something similar on the x3live
the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared
with practice ive become more proficient
most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker
but wow at this price how can one gripe
once i figured out how to set it up
the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy
i bought this as for practice
i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture
its easy to set up and use
i got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted
the classicmodified switch is pretty cool
thats it you arent going to move stretch or step on these cables
every once in a while ill get a 34dead34 string
for the price though its hard to knock on them too much
same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo
my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case
the sound is very big full and nice
this is perfect for our digital piano
its a good amp im happy with it
so i have to do it in the loop i guess
size hands i find its a good fit
worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make
also comes with a step by stepstage by stage instruction pamphlet
ive played this pedal for a while now and really dig it
i prefer woven cables for looks
it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand
this behringer dd400 delay unit has a lot of great features
i wouldnt buy another one
the instrument overall is fairly easy to play especially in the lower positions
the difference between hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable
i was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didnt
this replacement so far is hanging in there
it is very reasonably priced as well
at the time the ac2s were selling for about 85 new
this is a very very nice guitar strap
but its a nice design and thank you to the designer
feels pretty durable im sure it will last quite a while
very easy to tune my basses
i unplugged the usb cable for the microphone and things went back to normal
ive had the digitech xseries multidelay for many years
pickers playing next to me dont interfere with me tuning
this cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect clean sound
cause thats what this bad boy or girl to be pc does
am sure you will too
i have more use for an overdrive
it does one job only but it does it so well
that said there is only one piezo element unlike a kk pickup for example
some folks expect something different i suspect
thanks for the very thorough review mike
this is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron
its pretty enough and fine for a 100 guitar
stout stable and even looks good
these are a littl ehard to play
as far as durability goes they are the reigning champs
small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners
it works well with both single and doublecoil pickups
please dont pay someone to setup your guitar
it is easy to use
my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable
for the money this is one of the best products ive reviewed
thats about 58 inch thick
price also great with budget
but it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum
this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed
first off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable
i have been using the behringer acx450 for six months now
the strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable
i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head
nothing gave me better tuning on the first try
they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china
anyway i decided to change the strings because its been so long
how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated
i got what i paid for
whatever size you are looking for dunlop is the best option
in fact there really werent that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market
im never playing another guitar without these locks
but within 10 minutes of using it itll stick with you much better
only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars
i figured id give this a try
this pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture
distilled water will extend the life of the sponge
first it a great price  about the same as a big mac lol
i bought this for my kids aged 6  8 they love it
then theres the biggest problem
if you aint intelligent good luck
some of them had the white dot some didnt therefore they didnt look uniform
ive always found daddario quality to be great
i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents
60mm pitch black guitar picks best
so what if its not 100
it is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use
i am considerng replacing my takamine minijumbo with a seagull equivalent
its just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables
clean really good of prints and smell very nice
i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp
the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold
finish is variable be willing to accept whatever shade you get
replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl
right now it is the biggest bang for the buck
if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it
anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority
best sounding vocal mike for the bucks
but others know exactly what i mean
go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing
but i stomp on it regularly
as a home tuner or for a brightlylit gig  excellent
the reviewers werent lying except that one guy who gave it a 2
break in quickly and hold their tune work for all styles of playing
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings
those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat
no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors
if all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue
these are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured
this little tool will prevent that
you will like them on the guitar
in short i havent found a better shockmount for condenser mics
they had a very nice and balanced mids and highs
i have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great
the sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less
he loved the variety  number of picks
ive used and own many tuners and brands
head era korn comes to mind for me
same with treble bass volume and all other effects
you never know what will happen at a gig
i got about three of them
this guitar is good enough for any beginners
not much to say here  theyre knobs
these are a bit short only complaint
i got exactly what i expected
it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine
i bought one about 4 months ago and just ordered a second
the strings have a nice feel to them
i love this tuner so much
i was expecting it to be a little stiffer but im glad it isnt
do take note that this stand has a us standard 58 top
you can tweak the echo in 100s of different ways
so i dunno what that other guy was complaining about
its made by monster cable
i have a nanoweb before and so far the exp16 is better
this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance
driven full distortion it adds sustain
the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk
thats it for set up
the bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box
i would recommend these cables and will buy again
seems to work well though i dont know how long its supposed to last
the tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use
i highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar
im not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices
more knobs are not always better
we learned to play thanks to this kit
this is a great capo
id recommend it to anyone
my current band does not even play that many songs
good brand and good tone
with priceassortment in mind i give 5 stars
i have absolutely no complaints
guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string
i was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin
its really flexible on how youre planning to put on top of it
but very nice balance as i said
installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster
the pots look really good
so i and many others play nickel
easy to install and have never failed me
i like the super slinks as well
great for the dedicated guitar player
im not sure how you would wear it out really
then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out
i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals
its very stable and in tune all time while playing
i have only used it with garage band but it works really well
i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc
my mom bought me this one
not terrible but somehow chemical
this is such a sturdy board
there wasnt a 150 difference
the many reviews were absolutely correct
when the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works
i would not get these again in this size
works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar
they take great care to pack it well so no worries their either
honestly if i had it to do over i would skip this particular strap
the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping
however theyre definitely still usable after that
it works and it is relatively inexpensive
this one even has a pick holder built in
there are 2 ins and 2 outs 1 balanced1 unbalanced on each channel
great price but unfortunately this product didnt work for me
this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date
i still own most of these units except for this one
i bought my first pack over 7 years ago and ive been hooked
i prefer the warmer tone
its reasonably quiet acoustically but it shines when plugged in
but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it
these are also easily removed if they bother you
now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune
my son has also joined in the fun
it really nice made in canada not china wow
they sound great and play great and i usually purchase daddario or martin strings
heavy duty and nice looking
i might get another one for a backup
reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken
go sell your snake oil to someone else
my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these
i was 2495 when i got it
it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy
purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my sons acoustic guitar
this makes a great gift item
for 120 you get virtually every effect in the book
for me they were a waste of money
i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably
the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful
i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball
this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain
you can even work it into your live performances
i also have a boss tu3 pedal tuner
i havent tried the computer interface yet
he used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results
they have very little string squeak
i dont trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws
i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system
so thanks to amazon for making this possible
right product at the right price
after trying for a couple of hours i find that it wont do that
maybe behringer 3031as or something
they already have your money
this is also a pretty handsome looking caseif thats what you care about
i love the sound but dont want to change strings every week
the controls are volume off tone and overdrive
light weight and very portable
there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall
poor on recordings unless youre looking for that
sound great play great keeping their tune
bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops
once installed they are fantastic
i bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an allinone guitaramplifieretc
medium is my personal choice  they did not disappoint me
just get it try it and see if you like it jeez
some have noted the zoom doesnt have speakers built in
you get what you pay for
the amp modelling is fantastic
ive got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years
this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain
dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part
wow there is a lot of space on this thing
most of them are plastic
obviously behringer cloned the mackies and did a good job
i see other reviewers having issues
they last forever and have a great grip
could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box
it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot
i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes
it plays great  great fret job and solid tone
it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the evs
you dont buy 15000 pickup for a 200300 instrument
to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling
the color was a good match for the guitar
the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent
they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy
i know theyre incredibly durable as are all boss pedals
i really believe in these strings
the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles
my thick stock strings were killing my fingers
it sounds great clean or dirty
so much more efficient than a floor monitor
the connection strap is a great enhancement for my d18 and fits wonderfully
same deal laughter of the immortals
i just ordered three different guitar straps online
youll need to adopt a philosophy on gain
would have been nice to have a few really long ones
this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size
proper use of a traditional nonlocking tuner is just as stable
i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila
seems to me as good as any connector ive ever bought
keep em in every case
for 30 bucks this thing does the job
the strap locks do work
had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing
i have always used daddario strings
big win for the guitar though
take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal
was more than i expected for the price
for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever
oh and the return process
you can talk into your instrument
the usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe
unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners
this little bottle goes a long way
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
this manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars
best purchase i have made
when i put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly
such a fantastic price on this cant beat it
i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows
441 khz and 16 bit sampling
however all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars
the direct sound phones block a bit more noise
new straps seem to be easier to secure
my other review was not fair
does the job of holding a mic
still its a typical snark
i have no desire to buy any other brand
it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound
this is a good neck rack for gigging
i said all that bc i dont want to come off as condescending
theres nothing else to say but to get it if you need it
they all work the same
just remember the key words  slow and gentle
this switch does work but you should look before you leap
plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see
it will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking
if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you
does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down
once i added other pedals there became a horrible hum
ease of use and durable
nice to have in your gadget bag
this tool has high marks for one reason  it works
believe this 5 feet cable is no small thing
the first one started working about a week after i bought it
wish it had more speed variance but its great for the price
i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house
very nice metronome with just enough features
i own several of the snark tuners
i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day
you can dial it right in to get that srv sound
i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile
a lot of harmonics and output captured
the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my fender deluxe reverb amp
i have not switched form martin strings on that guitar
it just isnt a high end product5star perfect
five stars for what it does at this price
undoubtedly better for more accomplished players
i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex
the 12 club zt is super loud
it is very mobile easily adjustable sturdy and durable
they were for a 20 uke
dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasnt installed
for the price this is a good value
the gator will be reglued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars
you get either room or hall
one for the stand and and one for a mic
this is much better than the other brand i have
i have used on all my guitars
so far i havent had any issues at all
not a lot to say about it really
we review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about products
you can loop an effects processor thru it
but trust me this thing is really good
small yet clean and versatile
the price is right and the quality seems good too
its not gucci but doesnt feel like plastic either
these strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time
this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble
its 15 watts but its loud
i assure you its crapware and beware
it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal
now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise
here are my itemized observations  first three sets for 13 currently
maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it
but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction
it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths
i also have the same quality strings on my baritone ukulele
not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
great for videophoto work or even theater
they might actually be the same stand under different names
shipping was free it arrived in under 1 week from ordering
i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised
it is growing on me and i wouldnt part with it now
easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches
my best guess its playing style
great for instruments and vocals as well
it comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plugin cabling
seems to be sturdy and well built
with this my voice is strong and clear
all relevant areas of the capo are well padded
good product for a inexpensive foot pedal
im a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever
this product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately
the bag is well padded and i cant believe the price
juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh
a great choice for the price
it something nice to have around your house and work great
non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick
or go buy a k kustum and quit your sniveling
they feel and sound great when you play them
is compact once its folded up
i installed these pins in my silvertone sd10
some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but ive had no problems with mine
thats how much of a difference these strings make
extra light gives good action for my small guitar
it doesnt color or diminish your tone in any way
awesome crunch and great sustainability
works perfectly for the purpose
i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug
but i was annoyed that they  the bushings didnt fit the standardvintagesized
the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less
so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input
to sum it up i love this guitar
you need a pa that provides 48v power to use it
some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording
lets see what its got to offer for under 100
this was really a mind blowing thing
coated strings usually lack the bright highend brilliance that uncoated light strings have
great deal from amazon   thanks
they caused me to go out and buy another amp
i was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own
34why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually
like this camo capos simplicity and its unique color
so i say go for it
this is a fantastic little recorder but not for 300
but dont let the pocket be the selling point
this little box will give it to you
the dp008ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp03 digital portastudio
i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies
doesnt make a difference in the sound
sounds like a great concept and they seem well made
the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable
doesnt seem to put undue pressure on the guitar
i ordered this bench for last christmas 2005
this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous
not a huge range here
the guitar can be placed in strings up or down
i like this design better because of one simple fact
unless you just dont like daddario i would recommend these strings highly
this one is comfortable for 10 mins then its cramp time
i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly
the jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime
i couldnt be more pleased
i told him i would just get another
an excellent value and a great gift idea too
5 plus stars for this one
so my baby boom does the trick
to boot they are extremely comfortable as well
these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price
i have never been let down by ernie ball strings
and at the asking price who can resist
love love love the hastlefree access to my picks
i was even surprised they included a battery
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer
we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices
but ive confirmed i like heavier gauges
will keep on the side for next guitar
i like the fold up into a small package idea
5 feet is a weird length for a cable
it does it all and is tougher than nails
theres no real benefit to these strings
to my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar
as far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it
im in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play
i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume
ive tried a couple different heads and they all sound great
i like the gripping surface
it flows in sweeps like
i went back to my planet waves cable
you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often
i ran it through my swr california blonde ii acoustic amp
this one work great for us
whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it
013s on a taylor 210 dreadnought
i could not believe the sound quality
it is very clear sounding and very well built
they destroy luggage so i dont think it would fair well
im not really a corksniffer re  guitar tone
i cant recommend this pedal enough
a third button for reverb would have been amazing
crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch
also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want
i love the ej16 light gauge for their size and ease of use
i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems
i had it close but its the fine tuning that really helps
not much else to be said
this audio adapter works perfectly
these have pegs that insert
still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy
out of the 4 i have it only liked 2
great case didnt really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about
i wish i could find a guitar bag that was this nice
its not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down
and indeed it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching
the dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive
at full price of 1699 it is a solid deal
im not going to gush over this one
i dont like the feel or sound of these strings
works as expected and should last a really really long time
the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price
would it be only a one trick pony
i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele
action is adequate for practicewith a little tweaking its actually good
i also bought a pack of half wound 11s to try
i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string
025 width to the e string
it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime
a must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables
they work better than tuners costing ten times as much
great case for small cash
hands down the best pick ive used
the high strings were plenty of flakes
they are correct but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle
it was far better than i expected
after using it a couple of times i can only give it high marks
seems like spring is a bit too strong
it tunes the harp fairly well
put it to work making music within minutes
this unit is very small and tucks away nicely
with the lighter varieties that would be far from true
having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set
i bought this cable for my bands live show setup
speak from experience ive tried a lot and did many research
meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units
im a small woman and i really like that the neck is smaller
please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones
it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor
i often use my electric guitar unplugged
then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far
other than that the product works asadvertised
i got it today in the mail and i already tried it
the plastic housing is extremely strong and wont bust when used properly
this champ is made for one thing
dont go onto the stage without one on these boxes
it is a great idea and worth the cost
very handy and gets the job done quickly
im hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension
check out the ada gcs3 if you can
i would recommend this strap to all
some of the best aspects of the metal muff include 1
my suggestion  new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation
also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical
the harmonizing function can be buggy at times
it can do some strange things and get unique sounds
dont know why it didnt work just shorted out
i put this in my fender mim stratocaster
it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do
this comes complete with bridge saddles and full size block
it does everything its supposed to do
the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp
i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube
it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables
and ive been playing stringed instruments and ukus for quite a while now
the user guide is informative
kinda makes you aware of what you are playing
little bit modify at the bridge will make great guitar
the concept is great but the execution of it sucks
this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements
well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks
regular on is basically like a standard lead channel
and the cybertwin is gone now
i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating
tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes
its a mic cable haha
this is a nice tuner that works great
no big deal just more parts and weight
check the polarity of the tip  is the tip positive or negative
for any beginner this is the guitar i would but in there hands
2 installed driver on my old g4 mac running 105
overall though its a good buy for your line 6 amp
bought it after read reviews
just give some days to tuners to get used to
i did have to sand to make it fit
these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument
that may sound badm but i am glad because its better than too small
this is a pop filter
to me the warranty is worth it because of the price
it felt like my guitar hung around my neck
its just another example of tc hitting it out of the park yet again
the prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument
do be careful when unfolding as pinching of skin would be very easy
these microphones have a qualityfeel to them and they all worked perfectly
do not let the size fool you
so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly
im going to sell this product
i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic
no more issues with ground loops or other problems
this is as simple and as reliable as it gets
good luck with that chore
comes in a really nice case
all three of them have held up with no issues
this left the saddle too low to the neck
the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone
but it eats batteries like they were candy
ive heard that the adhesive doesnt work on rubber wood etc
good quality wired correctly cant complain
i really like planet waves products
works perfectly with audacity and windows 7 plug and play
i installed this in a super champ x2
i cant see it marring the guitar at all
i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out
i realy like the cutter
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap
its a classic rock pedal that screams
60mm nylon picks as my current standard  but decided to give the lighter
they really do help with speed and accuracy
this strap button works great
i am very glad i got the h2
wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night
guitar picks make a huge part of your tone
check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp
whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord
if i shove them in i cant get them out
they sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull
all in all quite a listening experience
i love my profire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong
this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces
unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle
the blue power light is blinding
thankfully it was just these cables
ive used electronic tuners for a long time
allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone
this coding system is consistent thru all their string sets
i got these for about 12 here on amazon
slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter
the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps
the monster chord is great looking but for me they are too stiff
i would buy it again
the truebypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged
fine for a few weeks now
i am pleased i have purchased this little yet great product
the only downside is that it doesnt stay tuned for very long
ive been using this for years
hes very happy with this purchase
i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp
i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings
audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables
i love the red burst design of this guitar it looks absolutely wicked
what is it they say in this era  caveat emptor
build quality is as solid as they come
i didnt expect this cable to be so thin
i just bought a dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggy
and with the lifetime guarantee you really cant go wrong here
except for that time i couldnt find it
if i needed another i would buy this type
quite pleased with this little mixerpreamp
average to 3 i guess
the primary effect of compression is to level or normalize the output across frequencies
its a good finish but not the place to start
the velcro seems to be of decent quality too
not much to say other than its a good cable
we have used this with an at2020 at2021
with that in mind its perfect
just pure creative sound that wont break the bank
im amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice
it connected well in the nady smpsx1 phantom power unit i bought
and compares well with other very high quality gear
it isnt top of the line but it gets the job done
but that is only a personal opinion
it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop
however i use it more as a frontend boost to my alreadyoverdriven bugera amp
unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell
and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height
one star just for it getting here on time
it works for guitar and bass
now stop reading this review and buy this capo
used it for more than a year with no issues
great value for the money
this product is exactly what they say it is
but they do the job just fine
this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made
has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer
its a great beachcampingcabin guitar
ghs strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these
ive done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter
great clarity and definition even on higher gain settings
only problem is the clip on install to the strap
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work
you cant beat the price
plus the tweed look really grows on you
just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
as long as your hands dont sweat a lot youll be fine with these
great for singing micing amps and such
this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects
as a veteran bluseman i recommend it
i dont use distortion pedals
so far i really like these
pt 9 is all i need
i got this at an awesome price too
same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory
installed easy and the screws and everything were correct
this is my 6th kyser capo
it doesnt happen when i boost my overdrives ocd  hardwire cm2
its not necessarily a bad different its just slicker and not as coiled feeling
really a major chore to get over a strap button
i particularly like the right angle plug
ive purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable
i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two
the thing is they get to be a bit overwhelming at least to me
to compare this i tried a g7 capo kaiser and schubb
for the functionality alone its definitely worth asking price
i would recommend this to anyone
comes in a pouch which helps to put it away
easy to use interface and very well constructed
so know that going in
im happy with this product
a phaser is a very specific sound but i love it in small doses
the analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal
will buy more in future
to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer
its not bad or anything just different
that last one was far far better than the first two
ive heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results
i used the standard dunlop nylon for years
i didnt realize it was so small
i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly
it is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price
the planet waves pwct12 is my new favorite
i found that a palms width from the tip of the mic works best
this was what i needed and it was cheap
sadly the volume only goes to 10
it looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand
i dont work for the company or have any ties whatsoever
i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldnt be happier
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar
i have never had any problem with any of these items
i also find it very accurate
my fingers get sore when playing
this pick is great for strumming
and that my friends is the problem
the construction is sturdy metal and actually heavierfeeling than a boss pedal
we live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals
cheap works great for playing and foot controllers
made my tone thin and tinny
its made of plastic but that doesnt effect anything its pretty tough
i bought this for my sons 7th birthday
then connect output of the ditto to the amp
do you like guitar music
this little 12inch model is highpitched but has that trashy wuhan sound
this strings have good sound and hold a tune well
they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity
id even say it was cute
looks good on any wall
a quality bag for a quality instrument
elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment
but for my purposes with a 3gs it is a brick
i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp
i put it down and didnt use it for quite some time
and control sound and volume at your fingertips
it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals
these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier
would i use it on stage or in the studio
i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap
it is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer disclaimer
one for the electric one for the acoustic etc
granted it doesnt look as nice but it does its job
this tin should last a lifetime
grunge was ok but not my kind of style
too hard to push notes through them
when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal
product is as described and fits mic perfect
this thing stands up nicely on all three
i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear
therefore your strings last much longer
i purchased this to teach myself to play a keyboard instrument
im glad i bought it
response and visual display are awesome
i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from
the only downside is the slight lack of bass
my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent
this can give some cleans and drive to distortion
i bought this for my daughter for christmas
sorry but thats some big company b
a good piece of kit
you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music
believe it or not ive been putting off buying one
there are two ports for speakers on the back side i havent used yet
i was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this
it polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new
i thought it worked good and mine was a bit dry
bottom line is elixirs sound great play well and least a really long time
but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal
they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge
months into using the gig bag and not a single problem
one could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment
i have restored an old rex commander
definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks
it is exactly what i wanted for a great price
are they as good as dedicated 100 per stomp box effects
next week ill purchase another with a different feature
i havent fooled with the other features metronome
fast fret  fast fingers
battery is included also so you can use it right out the box
you will not be disappointed
i have to do this every time i turn on the computer
the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but i prefer the acoustic sound
when playing the strings behave as normal
i previously used krk rp8s so i can compare these to them
recreates spring reverb very accurately
otherwise a great hanger that i trust for use with my expensive guitars
i am very happy with the guitar
i am proud to have this product
i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals
ill update after ive had it for awhile
you must use a 9v transformer which is not included
this capo design works best for me
theyre like most other brands medium
i like them and glad i purchased them  so far
it looks very professional and works without any problems
not the least bit stiff like some leather products
daddario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around
the behringer 302usb premium 5input mixer is just what the doctor ordered
i bought this for my teen son for christmas
this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints
it really makes my solos rip
my takamine acousticelectric fits perfectly and is very stable on the stand
im a new user but seem to be a great product
input has to be kept within a small range
im pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years
keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board
also there is no driver supplied by the company
i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy
to me thats a perfect combo
but without that i dont think id notice the difference with normal listening
ive had absolutely no problems with it
for me great studiorecording use but thats it
works great seems durable shipped fast
to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise
tubulaarrrrholds my 8 string 6 string acoustic etc
if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again
but for the price they are great
very nice case for the price
i definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together
you will hear the difference and they dont wear out like plastic
i would write them but thats their job
the sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing
there are two ways to think of this pedal
glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on
you can get a 25 cable for under 5 also here on amazon
so i heard these were good and ordered one to try
small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case
its a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder
i use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern
it worked but i dont use it anymore
i love this now i dont have to find my pick
its wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use
several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it
234 wide nylon strap is well made comfortable and should last many years
was very pleased with jp 600l pb acoustic guitar strings
compact enough to stow it in a guitar case
and has nice high quality chorus effect
at first i used the elixir polywebs but those things broke all the time
like the pic holder on front
this really cleans your strings
i dont get a huge loss of tone but a little bit
saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome
016 of the daddarios i usually play
they are the right length and go on easy enough
the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul
okay mine has just arrived
it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition
is a microthin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string
but i like them a lot
so ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now
unfortunately thats about all it does
these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut
makes the fretboard look and feel nice
the leds are a little cheesy compared to the old one though
dont judge their products on price alone
it requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time
these were things i could easily hear
well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this fender amp
but this is a great stand
great quality for the money and works well
second both straps were not adjustable to 5934
this is a nice microphone stand
it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters
a classic that will surely live on
this was maybe 10 years ago
they are simply the best there is for a fair price
but you must be careful
its a nice guitar for the money
i play an acoustic guitar so i dont run around a lot
ill update this review if i have more to report
when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion
low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned
these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well
other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems
of course hohner has been around longer than me
i replaced everything with those
the guitar is 3ply plastic blackwhiteblack
as with all boss  roland products the boss fs6 performs as designed
all in all this is a great guitar for a great price
this strap fits the bill just fine
sturdy provides good support and looks good
you really cant go wrong with this capo
works on everything i own which is 3 acoustics and 1 gretsch hollow body
just clip it on and swivel the head to face you
rubber no skid bottom is a plus
its very lightweight and with its optional plug and onoff switch is versatile enough
i figured id save a bit and get a couple more from amazon
the system is super easy to use and store on your amp
all i can say is wow
works well while other things are going on around you
the best look and performance on a fender guitar
cool tube piezo tone from my shencpk8t is dropdead gorgeous
i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away
and no tape or other sticky stuff
it is similar to this one
i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year
with stretching they stay in tune fine
i use it with home recording and it is great for my needs
theres some element of nostalgia with the ds1 that ive just never understood
i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and 4 acoustics
it doesnt sound exactly like an sm57 but it will get you close
never had any problems with them
very nice quality inexpensive guitar strap
it fits my mxl mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem
on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits
perhaps i didnt take the time
for the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose
this device works well but sound is far from perfect
it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great
i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me
ive never met a set i liked in any single way
i recommend it as a well functioning stand at a very economical price
a piece of double stick tape shaped to match the pick holder is included
but this is my favorite muff thus far
it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing
and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on
this keyboard is pretty dope
it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics
i may play around with it to see what all it does
that is a great strap and has held up wonderfully
i have not used them for a regular guitar
definitely theyre worth a try
will this even work on a 6string bass
i enjoy this product and i definitely use them on my acoustic
i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint
i listen to music about 3  4 hours a day
the glass is a much softer more subtle sound than metal
comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble
it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure
but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good
other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily
long lasting and backed up by the company
for this price it is a do not recommend for me
available in several finishes to match your taste
for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable
my friend left a thin pick and i tried it
they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing
set your guitar down on it by accident when its plugged in and
i love tascam gear and have used it for nearly 30 years
would like to purchase another one in the future
i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too
20 seconds really isnt much
but your tone will still stink
never broke a string but i only play at home as a hobby
theyre shiny and screwed well into the holes
this however is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot
does it wear over time
nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time
this is essentially a toy
easy to operate easy to read
i always lose my damn picks this helps
i pretty much just leave these on all the time
reasonable price great sound  long lasting
the five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste
this small stand does not hold most all ukes
with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect
for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok
at these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments
im not a fenfer fan but i really love this tuner
no slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwards
ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now
it does a fantastic job
this little gem is worth its weight in gold
well i love da fender products always have always will
i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal
its does not appear to be of better quality
also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo
i read several reviews before purchasing these strings
much lighter and thinner then any strap that i have had
i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks
it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well
you can definetely trust them to do their job
well i need to correct this
this is how basic chords relate to each other
good quality bag for my epi lp
have them on four guitars
would need a heavier base for use with a boom
a great buy for the money
our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack
if the knob ever breaks they are a very easy replacement at radio shack
its been great so far
what more do i need to say
its got an attitude but it soft at the same time
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
like the crush or roland cube it has its own voice
it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick
under windows 7 all i had to do is plug it in
overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand
this box is what i have been missing out of my setup
analog dry signal thru with digital delay
for everyone else look elsewhere
might as well go allin
i just cut the volume on my guitar snark senses vibrations through the neck
it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes
i love the fact that the feet do this
i really expected better quality for 3500 after such light use
they even include free picks  which is so cool
it just feels good in your hands
very good quality cable and plugs
its a good product just what i expected
came with a great little travel bag
they also cost about twice as much as equivalent noncoated daddarios
is that this thing is heavy
i have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable
not even a year old
i dont have the matching extension cabinet because i just dont need it
its hard to beat the quality of monster cables
its smaller and lighter than the snowflakemore diminutive than the picture would suggest
so reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding
volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4
other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability
it works great and is very easy to use
its for my wife who is learning guitar
moment from time to time  more falls into place
i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy
when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design
it is just not a good stand
there is a headphone jack which is why i bought it
i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy
ive had one of these for about 2 years now
they last a long long time and are surprisingly easy to grip
it can initially be a rather shocking experience
its all comes back to our ability to make good music
its a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars
straight from the case these dont bend well but do not despair
a dull inept version of a tubescreamer
great product for entry level and great price for what you get
to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip
same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it
im sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar
im 6 so it might not be high enough for a very tall person
i bought one and had the same experience
in my humble opinion the pictures make the product look purple
as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful
this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope
neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp
this feels like a professional microphone
i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good
brass color lock that comes with it
hold a tune very well and sound good
just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal
there is so much in this little box
behringer has never been very documentation oriented
i use this strings with an ibanez rg custom with dimarzios
this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
a thumbs up for this one
great classic rock 70s tone
probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs
they stand out because everyone loves the idea of them
small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play
i have a set of the original locking tuners on a 84ish strat
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
i also found that im getting better response with my guitar tone knob too
but even when its off im getting absolutely no buzz from my effects
ive got at least 6 spares at home right now
because its such a sound platform to begin with pun intended
there are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about
they say that they are true bypass but they are not
kk you have a convert in me
you arent even looking at this pedal
i like it and will use it again
its comfortable and you can wear it for hours
i wish it was made in america
the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over
i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand
this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused
i went a long time convincing myself that i didnt need these
it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet
for the price im really happy
look at the other reviews and you wont be disappointed
has multiple patterns to collect sound
with those goals in mind i was pleasantly surprised how good the bx5 sounded
thats one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals
by the way the oldschool tweed look is a plus too
i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments
these stands are great for my lesson business
the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it
update  the software works well  is very useful
it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks
i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording
works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro
i bought this strap for my taylor guitar
i use the ns2 when i use my chain of pedals
i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great
i think what happened is i just left it on too long
on the metal channels it really drives the gain over the top
i dont rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci
i rate it at 5 stars
i use this for my ipad
only annoying thing  the case arrived locked
you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
the lace hot gold value pack with a hot gold hot bridge pickup
but for what it is it is fantastic
i have used the mxl 007
id pay for a better one if i had to get another
you do use them right
dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players
i think it works great
this is a big help at rehearsals
overall though i am very happy with the way this stool feels
honestly they dont need to be at least for most guitars
i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings
and too hard to figure out
each string is labeled so you know which goes where
easy to put togetherstable and cheap
luckily i order two packs
i  fits well in my hand and is well balanced
i like these strings for their warm  mellow tone
they glisten when he uses this to polish them
this is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier
i wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar
they sound better more prefessional
the legs are easily removable for storage
i really like the idea of a 34pick34 pocket in the strap
all in all im very pleased
theyre probably all as useless as you imagine they might be
snap is large and holds well but is easy enough to unsnap when needed
now for jazz and metal i use this pick
there is definitely a lot of clarity here
in fact i highly recommend biyang whenever somebody asks about it
guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot
but positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily
including many delays and echos
and a previous reviewer said his dot with bigsby fits
no more feedback or waking up the next room
not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand
its has a cool analogvintage sound of chours
however those strings just didnt have enough bass and too much highs
its easy to install very tough and i love how it looks
very quick reaction to string
i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also
i felt as if the uke was well worth the low price
ive got a couple of these and for the most part im very satisfied
i am using it with win7 64bit  sonar xl producer
the jams improvement in avoiding feedback alone made it worth its price
i would not suggest this to anyone
all in all a good but not 34perfect34 stand
they all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade
these stay connected but arent so wide that they change the style of picking
best straplocks i have ever had
these are the thickest picks ive ever used
im not complaining i just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups
the pockets are packed with books tools and strings
they have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see
by some sort of mixup i got nanowebs by mistake
dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years
this strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable
i purchased this for my sons acoustic guitar
this stand works fine if you dont need a shock mount
but for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered and is an excellent product
if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my 1
i was surprised by the size
great foot switch that is easy to use
behringers tm300 is made from tough plastic
for the money you cant get one that touches it
i keep in e flat tuning and it stays
it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive
im only sad they dont make a noise gate or something similar
goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now theyve updated its look
my own opinion about this is i love it
not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords
so far it does some good things but it could be much better
the tone of my ovation was back
you get what you pay for
for your money i cant recommend the eq enough
i also tried two mxls
its a small smart tuner
nice airlinesized bottle w safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening
the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out
ive used this pedal with a casio px200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now
overall it wasnt a huge issue just a bit annoying
this levys jacquard strap is well made and comfortable
the action was a little high for my taste
put them on an eric johnson strat
cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it
rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive
in a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold
i saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled korg
i have to say that i love the strings
the pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus
havent used it for anything else though so cant comment there
with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while
it has a nice color throw too
what you would come to expect from lanikai
this is subtle yet effective
what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect
in summary its ready to be used right out of the box
but it is still an error in functionality
i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value
reputedly the joyo us dream is a copy of the suhr riot distortion pedal
i keep this with my battery tester for my actives
these mics are very solid and i cant tell them from the real deal
all in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly
power adapters are your friend
foot switches are easy to use
one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply
340 holes in my allparts neck  theyre a little large
plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal
no need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters
they suit my playing style well
with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar
i am a glutton for punishment
unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights
its perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use
so i hope all of this helps you with your decision
the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed
i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine
these strings are worth it
the polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster
it does what it says
i would recommend this to anyone
it holds my heaviest books without tipping over
i thought id give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews
i can buy an adapter with onoff switch for microphone
for a number of reasons
ive had them on for a couple of weeks now playing fairly regularly
balanced signal is so much better
for this price its hard to beat
the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better
so far it is working great
it is perfect for mac or pc
get it if it fills a need for you and youre broke
this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion
its so stinking small and thats what counts
i now only use metal slides
these are the best picks out there
updateafter using this microphone for a while i find it to be somewhat lacking
the highest i feel comfortable tuning these to is e flat
but again the amp is plenty loud and fullsounding for its size
this pick is well designed for mandolin playing
great sound and great deal
i doubt you can beat this for 25
its explained in the manual but could be clearer
it is a decent cable
i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years
i saved 30 from buying another ac adapter that supports 240v
im hoping they last a while
this is good but it takes some getting used to
only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad
this strap was great i was glad to find this well made wide strap
i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center
i have to rethink the way i use fx in this box
but if youre not too picky this will suit you very well
sounds identical to my shure sm58 but much less
they are excellent quality for the money
great for the knock around uke though
that may seem like a small issue
dials and sliders work smoothly
i bought 2 to try them out and i intend on buying more
im not an overdrive player
it just does the job and im more than satisfied
it offers ample volume for small venues
the exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending
i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great
it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules
with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar
the main genres i play inharmonics and sustain to spare
i can tell a slight difference
this delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion but a nice bit of fuzz
with this pedal its easy
will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of nonuse
id give this 1 and a half stars if i could
there are a lot of really expensive distortionod pedals out there
bought a few while back and just bought a few more
this works and i really like evans
i ordered black but got brown
i found the product without too much difficulty
it just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands
luckily i keep that on hand
however for the price it didnt perform
this works perfect with the quick release system i also purchased
first of all this is a 40 7guitar stand
now i have 8 channels of automation  stop back record play etc
i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great
the material used is fine
i have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me
these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use
the pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too
buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it
im super happy with my joyo pedals
i wish i would have thought of these
as for design i dont buy the german innovation advertising line from behringer
so be sure to try them out first before buying
action is low but does not buzz very easy to chord
love the coil love the price
this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1 so it buzzes longer
combined with the absolutely deplorable build quality of the clip itself
if that isnt what you want then i would look elsewhere
many good capos have been made
does what it is supposed to do
ive ordered 9 of these and only one has been defective
appears to be well made
looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well
the fg 700s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar
you can spend more but this does what you need it to do
we recorded in 4ch mode with two extra mics
but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections
i have four of these  and will continue to use this product
tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge
basically it is much more to the point
thats something that should only happen once in your life if at all
we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner
fast to take on and off of your guitar
everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well
every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support
i use these at parties and they work good for the price i paid
describing its sound with words helps but doesnt really do it justice
if used with an amp maybe
if it had sturdier wall mounts id give it 5 stars
always experimenting with my sound
for someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal
my son practically ran to the ups man when the truck pulled up
also considering the lunchbox extension cab
it works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen
nice bright tone  and last a
and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality
this is a 000  om acoustic
i would not purchase this product again
my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower
its not meant for metal
the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is
this is a very nice product to use
works really well considering how inexpensive it is
i have two of these stands the electric guitarbass version and the acoustic version
the cable died on me in less than a month
if youre using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicely
you do receive two other software options with the device
theyre all full of crap you dont need
the second probably flows from the first
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar
if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better
they should last 34 months  you dont do anything else
but its well built and would make a decent od
all in all its a pretty nice device expecially for the price
just a push on the pedal and im switching noiselessly between guitars
this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones
this is not my first guitar
it wont a guitar break
i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal
my newest amp the marshall jvm410 joe satriani replaced the reverb with noise gates
he really likes it a lot
it is solidly built and apprears road worthy
tried the same lick with the ragin cajun and it sounds perfect
other then that it is all rock
not all chords are in here but the 34core34 chords are
attack refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck
this new strap is plenty long enough and looks good
they have an industry standard packaging
i bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year
the seat is generously padded and is 25 inches thick
quality at the right price
these may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny
the tuning pegs gears were stiff and a bit hard to turn
the case is nice as well
been using this brand of strings since 1971ive always been pleased
good product for practice or recording
it came down to the ac15 fender blues jr and the ibanez ts15
it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping
i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made
i know silly but i was not paying attention
i bought a case of these
the tip is a little more rounded
mixed bag and at 200 shouldnt be
otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years
for that application this is the windscreen to get
i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard
when unplugging it just be careful and itll last a lot longer
i took a chance and got this one and it was a good call
i can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar
this is not a subtle pedal
this is an amazing guitar
very nice clip on tuner for the price
good quality for the price
and it has worked flawlessly
glue and a rubber band now holds it together
i love these microphones i really do
i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers
love that i didnt have to assemble this stand
the teens really liked the colors to choose from and i like the price
cant ask for much more in a tuner
my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing
i have used daddario ej16 pb lights for years
but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected
used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo 6
he has had other brands but they just dont stand up to elixir
it may just have been the one i got though
if youve seen the youtube videos then you know what this can do
rhythm and lead styles both sound great
if you use ext mic
the fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing
it turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather
its likely theyll keep this style but revise it some
man this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks
i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar
this is a great set
i have stopped using asio4all and i get decent latency
i could not be happier
in this case i agree
now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own
i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem
i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power
this capo cannot work with it
a nice addition to my recording home studio
i lose picks so easily i needed a pick hold
as for build quality my h2 is like new after almost 18 months use
and no i dont work for daddario just a longtime fan
as my reviews demonstrate im a sucker for a new tuner
price seems high for what it is and vs
it doesnt come loose or wiggle once in place
i cant get the bottom guitar support to lock in place
but once its on it works
simple and useful rack stand
but you may want the rack version for those applications
this product does what you want and is easy to take on and off
oh man do they sound nice
i play morning noon and night
although it doesnt have a tone dial it doesnt need one
this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough
the tuner hole size is
hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good
just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts
i wont waste money on the more expensive cables again
yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference
ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price
but then again i probably will try  to use it that way
they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them
almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost
if youre looking at them then get them
it gets easier the more you do it
this mic is built like a tank yes as others have said
great little amp to mess around with
im not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing
to the less and also most expensive strings
these are nice and sturdy picks
these are basically the same as schaller strap locks
this is handsdown the best tuner ive ever owned
only downside is i think the nashville capo looks better
a real money saver a very smart buy
already planning on purchasing more
they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers
i hooked this up to the output of my mackie mixing desk
it is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online
the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too
not kidding dont use those in public situations
usb with this shockmount as well as the at2020 usb and xlr version
great product ive use them before and have always thought they were top quality
they are inexpensive and pretty
thought about new sensor mullard ris or sovtek el84m7189s
this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot
con packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks
for general use in doors its decent and for sure worth the price
i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes
for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill
it respects my arms desire for freedom of movement
im super happy with my joyo pedals
and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled
kinda sucks that its not level out of the box so 4 stars
the more aggressive recording level solved that problem
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isnt very friendly
this handles bass tuning much better
why no 5 star review
its not a highend 200 pro stand
the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted
breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response
obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer
which if you dont have you need it
i dont care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks
if you buy this you really need to baby it
this also happened to two of my friends snarks
lots of metal where there needs to be metal
its hard to call it any particualr sound
nice works and no problem
this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad
but a new strap and put these on right away
its cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if youre careful
i can tell you what it sounds like
600l is the exact same string gauges
ive been recording using garage band
adding the oport deadened the lows
there is no mid way on this pedal either
the smell of this guitar is also amazing
a great price and a good item
the springs in the back keep it back
decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di
you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound
they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price
it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset
that would not make it a deal breaker
lots of gain tons more than my boss sd1 wthe monte allums sd808 mod
this is a great cable at a good price
these head phones are a much better solution
at least it wont fall off soon
bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything
it has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders
i finally ended up getting the tascam dr07 which i am very happy with
the hootenany style is sweeeet
give it high marks for form and function
a definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick
compared to the tortex style pick material 1 mm for the tortex
holds my acoustic 6 string great
the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied
thanks samson now just make better mics
this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode
no this tuner is not super tight
the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position
great performance sub par construction
i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay
i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the gs specs
we will never run anything other than this design going forward
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists
i would recomed this product to everyone
it is like the swiss army knife for string winding
this is my first tuner in a long time and im please with it
if you have a guitar and amp you will need this
it would have 5 stars but for the recent failures
tuners old style not sealed
my fingers just couldnt do it for extended play
they are also in a good color so they dont stand out too much
i needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one
you go through batteries like crazy and it doesnt work at all for bass
i ended up returning the whole shooting match
but for general purpose use and abuse
good for table top cajon hole by floor or recording
for 10 bucks its a great piece
i cant recommend this product
every acoustic is different though
they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i8217ve played
i believe the lead amplug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature
these nobs fit great and look great
so for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather
just remember use some common sense dont expect the guitar to totally stable
i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago
ive tried many and these are the best by far
i have not had to replace mine
another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software
i cant say if they last longer vine has us review this asap
i got this china and was blown away by it
it works greatit keeps my music in order
stick to known brandslike shure ev at etc
on tv theyre sold for 80
everything is so quiet with no hum
like i said its a great gig bag
not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a 90 guitar
this thing is just sweet i just love it
so i just ordered another one of these
i paid a lot more for the gibson and 149 bucks for this epiphone
for the price this works really well
guitar bag fit over my fender t bucket guitar
my stereo image even feels wider now
i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar
24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain
it has a rich full bodied sound
the 299 models are great right out of the box usually
sturdy and easyt to setup
its smooth to use and the sound is superb
it doesnt stay where you need it
i have other harmonicas but thought id like a set of blues harps
it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit
wide overdrive and tone range
i just wasnt at the right height
i have several stands and this is the second one of these i bought
the tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful
id definitely buy it again
but what else can you expect from a us company like gibson
tip  a little goes a long way
well here it is friends in all its glory
its right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time
these are easy to install and simple to use
glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars
im a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups
this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply
it functions but doesnt sound great
this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there
i measured this mike at 103 ounces
i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent
i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box
it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
another quality product from hosa
the suction cup does not work
it was my first guitar
this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm57s
the retailer gave me some mediums
these  picks  r awsome
all in all a pretty good device
the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube
highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar
this model is not usb
i bought the wrong gauge
great for all your needs
i plug in my even tide timefactor and works great by itself
so be aware of that
i am new at trying to learn
it is also small which i appreciate
every part of these cables are quality
the musicians gear stand does everything i needed it to
i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems
i bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall
but i figured how can you go wrong
since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try
until i switched them around
it does just what i wanted it to do
you wont regret this purchase at all
a good tool for study and applying to your music
screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use
it goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily
i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune
i was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance
this pedal has a cool 1950s style  appearance
all in all id say the design of this is very user friendly
i was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle
it has exceeded my expectations
these strings are the best all around for tone clarity punch and volume
just a great overall tuner
it tunes nicely and so far as my ear is concerned accurately
there is nothing cheap or toylike about it
so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound
i really cant find any negative about it
i honestly was not impressed
this is the perfect amp for bed practice
turned it down and the sound got much better
in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent
both mine measured 4534 from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended
most of my pedals are 20 to 30 ma
ive been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade
this is the capo to get
i might have to sell one of my lexuses
keep it right in your case
this was a great buying experience
this recorder is okay but its far from perfect
i have two other fuzzsswollen pickle  mxr 108 classic fuzz
returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass
snug fit but imo not too tight
its only fault is its price
however the manual shows exact settings for computer use
they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels
kind of somewhere in between
we are talking about major bugs here
this one is the most basic
this is a great size
expect to pay 5 to 6 for a replacement battery
turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done
i would buy it again if required
comfortable and the grip works wonders
so he mentioned this capo and i immediately chortled
a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses
good price came quickly through prime
i bet if you bought one you would like it
this means their stuff is made to last
prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses
the rogue ra090 comes in a variety of color choices
it has a year warranty period
some of them have good quality both in make and sound
but thats not a problem any more either
sound in my opinion needs some tweaking
i use the stand at home too
not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes
most of all they are cheap
buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones
overall i like this winder
can be done but not as good
for 10 you cannot go wrong with this
they lasted 3 years and i play nearly every day for hours
best 100 ive spent on gear
for this price you will be satisfied
ive used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar
using cheaply made cables could affect your sound  you can loose top end
not so hard on the fingers
works great on my 100 watt amp
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
ive used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments
quality strings do sound different and nearly as importantly they feel good too
these are great for connecting effects pedals
however that was before a firmware update
its a lot quieter now
point two  any form of gain will create a ton of hiss
i just picked up a pod hd500 and i love it
this little fellow is great
this was an easy choice for me
these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive
for the bread this is a great strap
measured how loud this thing is
this sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments
i rate them excellent in that category
the beat boy is everything that this unit is and then some
i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear
i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly
it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music
all you need is a 10mm socket and your are set
the knobs are solid and work just fine
my music program had no problem detecting it and using it
this pedal lives up to the hype
my equipment is very secure
only thing i regret is not getting one sooner
this is by far the best ive ever had
not the greatest but ok
still love it but not to a 5 star level
this may be a big issue if you dont treat your equipment carefully
they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick
they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective
you can use it in a number of different ways
not sure about longterm durability or signal lossinterference
i played with light acoustic strings for a long time
this is a nononsense cheap guitar stand
because its not programmable im getting another
the beams are narrow but you get two of them
in a band mix im pretty sure it would get totally lost
it is easy to use
rings around the hole and stripe on the back
extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this
if it breaks ill post about it
if youre accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it
then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again
i will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future
get yours while you can at this price
over the years ive literally owned dozens of electronic tuners
each one different in it on right
nice sturdy and portable case
the stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended
the price is great too
i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times
it is a 5star product
the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eqd for saturated distortion
maybe its just a matter of finding the right place to put it
this is really quite a fantastic little gizmo
other than that quite useful and durable
so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not
this one is very good long lasting guitar strings
maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one
cant even tell if it is on or off
this may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventually
hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning
this is more for your parlor acoustic setup
but i got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap
keep it mind it is xlr for those that havent noticed
these are good dont get me wrong
i dont think its true bypass either
i dont have to guess or squint
quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their goto house mics
so you can have this thing on the go
i just got done installing these
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
if you wanted to tune and didnt have a 14 input good luck
that said the only thing i like about this order is the case
if these dont work for you you can always buy the vpick
i purchase this hercules gsp38wb ag guitar hanger for my yamaha 700
beautiful sound for each of the different modes
very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows
you can never go wrong with real fender parts
plastic comb with no recess
buy it you will never regret
for years ive owned a nice at4033
the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected
theyve inflated to 160 and thats just ridiculous
the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well
but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong
durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum
these are some bright strings
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
i am a weekly player and have been for 40 years
the price is not too bad
its great in all ways but one  the rubber feet constantly fall off
i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry
my experience 1 try to install from disc
no more battery swaps no more searching for a 9volt every 5 minutes
nice cushion on both sides  onstring and the back of the arm
great quality string winder and cutter
there is no noise or other problem so far
it looks feels and sounds amazing
whats not to like here
the m5 is serving that purpose
i have found no major issues with any of them
i really like this stand
the notes are surprisingly cleansounding coming from a guitar thats so lowpriced
the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze
they sound great and last forever
oh and the casing isnt like a wimpy plastic knife plastic
88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing
having said that for a 40 bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me
i may order another if this one performs well
is very sensitive to vibration
even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal
very easy to install on the wall
looks nice displayed in the corner of my office
very analog sounding not digital
sure its a bit of a onetrick pony but its a pretty good trick
i lost my trusty slide and really miss it
it is a great pleasure to jam on it around
once i get around to playing with it i will write another review
if the strings are in individual labeled packages theres no need for the colors
they are much more precise nearly good enough to intonate an instrument
a more forward lead guitar sound
sometimes lower c and lower a look alike
i no longer use heavier strings like i use too
i used doublesided sticky tape  problem solved
clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers
still to me it was money out the window
youre probably also buying your strings by the box
it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components
at the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up
note its vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference
honestly this looks really sharp put together
i would buy them again
besides who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works
looks nice and works as intended
its perfect for my samson mic
its my own fault for not looking at the specifications
quick install works like a dream
i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size 8
dont play another show without these
if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though
what the hell was behringer thinking
it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined
i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal
this pedal has flawless colorless sound quality
they made my cv50s sound fuller with greater sustain
i hadnt played any of my string instruments for some time
it sounds very nice especially for the low price
the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind
its the best strap money can buy
no problems with seller and product came quick
plug in for a miccdm3 player
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy
also works to cut ukulele strings
no neck damage to axes
i use these on my hofner and gibson es135
and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box
the product is here and i am glad the size is right
purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo
i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good
the color stands out well on the black background
it takes a while for the shipping but thats stated in the description
i like the picks a lot
i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply
they are even and not warped like the stock ones were
im not sure how much i can say about a mute
i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one
overall this is well worth the 500 that they list as the msrp
i wouldnt take it on a tour or anything it is plastic
this does a fine job of cutting even a thick e bass string
i have used roland and fender amps and pas
i keep ordering more of these picks
i just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting
definitely recommend these over any other string trees
many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion
the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom
good tone and they stay in tune
a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa
i got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect
also its cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you
i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke
after checking each string multiple times
she has the korg tm40 metronome
you can also do this with all the other channels too
for those players bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars
the strings last a long time in my opinion
in terms of the other features i cannot comment
these were just what i needed
the terms bait and switch come to my mind
my capo is 8 years old
i bought two of these
these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors
but thats expected and not that big of a deal if youre careful
for the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion
accurate with tv on in the background
recommended by eric friedman on a post and im glad i followed the recommendation
a few basses i prefer higher
and it is fender licensed
go ahead and buy it
its all just so much marketing garbage
very sheep relatives with the quantity
the price is fair for all that
no one hears themselves the way they sound to others
its a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations
by the way these are listed as
one hinge broke after about a year of normal use
it plays beautifully with my 100w amp
this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner
quite simply this is a really nice guitar
and it arrived in 4 days since i returned the first one
martin is at the top of the heap
i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro
plus they are all padded afor protection
it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time
i would say it muffles too much though
guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar
