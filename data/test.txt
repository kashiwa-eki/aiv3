use this for my desk mic at home
the boss pedals however were hit or miss
a function i absolutely love
what more can you ask for
i mean you pay for a quality instrument right
that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better
my favorite brand of strings right now
i very much recommend it along with some dunlop straploks
very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows
however there is 1 con to this wonderful instrument
this is my new favorite tuner
i read great reviews here and the price seemed good
i dont know about a 7 or 8 string though
this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage
the ones i got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture
the lubricating feature is just a nice plus
in fact there really werent that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market
clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar
this unit is like a old blue jeans
ive been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade
got this to put into my pseudocaster project guitar
i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is
go no further for your volume pedal needs
so all is not lost there
not much else to say
i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out
who uses flexible mic clips
oops there goes a star for the con job
if it will reach its great
really just stupid powerful for 300
but make sure there are return privileges
output is not a problem if you are amplified
and there are multiple sound options including phantom and instrument
theyre very inexpensive but seemingly quite high quality
you can read my review on that item
as it is its very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii
but its been a trial  error for me
the notes are surprisingly cleansounding coming from a guitar thats so lowpriced
very good idea and holds it perfectly
one thing thats less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself
its really hard to beat this product for the price
no complaints its quiet enough and the price is right
fits my behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine
thank u guys your pedals really kick butt
it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe
these will save you time guaranteed
the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing
its much better than what i got with my violin
so what if its not 100
to brigthen the sound a tad
works the way its supposed to
the resulting sound is absolutely topdrawer and completely belies the incredibly low price
i have about quit using picks now
they are absolutely fantastic for the price
for 8 you cant beat it
manufacturers website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar
unlike the fender which you have to press and hold
i swear i was done in 20 minutes
no one hears themselves the way they sound to others
the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm
will buy this brand again
it can range from dramatic to very subtle
pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release
the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too
theyve come out with the sn8 i hear which ill buy soon
they last about twice as long
i used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems
he wanted a tone that sounded like his
only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps
i will stick to gls products from this point forward
come on capos dont have 34tone
recommended just remember the price point and you wont be disappointed
these cables are nicely constructed
this one offers almost no protection
good buy for the price and nothing else is required
yes this guitar has an oiled finish
a new battery didnt resurrect it
im going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light
needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill
sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars
i may get one in the future its only 4050 bucks on here amazing
i highly recommend purchasing one
i dont this is it for meat least not on acoustic
definately get an adapter for this
it is very clear sounding and very well built
a couple years ago i switched to yellows
i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one
gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot
the almost play themselves imo
the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound
theyre probably all as useless as you imagine they might be
buy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny
i use this for working on my guitars mainly
their strings produce excellent sound and are durable
the beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response
we have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive
i have used it for years
ive seen an awful lot of products come and go
at around 450 for six picks these are some expensive pieces of plastic
but im not certain these last so much longer
this pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a blueridge br160
i figured id give this a try
i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material
id give this levys strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible
it is 100 accurate and very easy to use
tone is good as is durability
all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works
but ya get what ya pay for
on my el cheapo violin these strings sound quite nice
these are descent quality cables
if you are looking for a les paul guitar this is not one
there are a lot of really expensive distortionod pedals out there
the sound is great the wattage is good everything is wonderful
add the limited lifetime warranty and gibson support and this guitar cant be beat
in short   its a winner
in practical terms no not for this sort of item
and i think they will last longer
it is heavy which i knew going in
these strings are my second choice after the elixir 8020 bronze
you dont need the expensive ones this works just fine
as a conclusion im really pleased with the quality of the digitech cm2
this champ is made for one thing
first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x3live
and these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply
the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall
and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone
also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash
personally i love the nanoweb strings
the oval shape is perfect
it was not what i wanted
i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites
its performance is minmax the same
i would recommend this to any beginner
just thought i would point that out
the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended
most of them are plastic
but this means trial and error and a busy wallet
good thing i had purchased the 9volt power adapter
amazing lowend output for such a small cab
the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp
it is a mandolin case
very disappointed in built quality
for the money this ones a nobrainer
it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality
sent it back and did not reorder
im going to sell this product
they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse
maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain
great performance sub par construction
this worked out of the box
when they work theyre absolutely great and theyre so cheap
i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isnt my thing
i saw some hybrids on amazon and had never heard of them
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either
plug in ipod or computer with 35mm male cable
these are my goto strings
i dont like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes
the guitar is new and has the strings that came with it
i have an electric and an acoustic hanging up
i would suggest going with the black for this reason
great heavy picks amazingly cheap price
some complained about each band boosting others
he also likes the small size
no changing hardware like strap locks
everything is solid as a rock
works well and easier to read than many of its competitors
so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable
the price is fair for all that
8020 strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar
i use alot of the other ones as well
theres not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing
mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body inside
and the build quality is solid
i enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars
ah the folly of youth
the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality
easy enough as i completed this is one minute
folds up if needed for travel
the pioneer hdj 2000 has the look
i installed these pins in my silvertone sd10
this case solves that problem
the sound quality is surprisingly hot
it works better than my piano
not much to say about a guitar strap
great for everything from slapback to long delay with heapbig repeats available
if needed i would buy another
but i think he played a little bigger uke than this lmao
this pedal however is going to get some serious use
has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesnt prevent dry out
everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs
if not your money is best spent elsewhere
i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome
i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect
an excellent value and a great gift idea too
and such a good price
i was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own
low to the ground so balance is not an issue
i use them for rhythm runs and even lead
thanks for the prompt and good service
i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome
it works on my orlando classical guitar as well
i mean these are cables
it came in perfect condition
accurate little accessory only works with guitars
so much so i may send it back
they are much more precise nearly good enough to intonate an instrument
also  for my baritone ukulele
great foot rest i recommend it
it was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront
pay attention to the warnings
i dont play with a guitar below my waist
i was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics
the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate
i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it
works and it is good
i think these will be what i play from now on
fyi  dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp1101 as part of his live rig
my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird
with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly
tune my mandolin and banjo with it
already has made my life easier
no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in
ill just keep using my pockets
this epiphone hardshell case is a real bargain
1 star off for not looking like the higest quality
they seem well put together and just feel nice
than you normally do and give these bargainpriced nickels a try
i write and record my own music
if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely
the tone is bright and snappy
i am very satisfied with my purchase
in that regard the image shown here is wrong
i have them in chrome in every guitar i own
i dont use them all too often because theyre a bit too stiff though
when it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly
this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar
easy to adjust with reversible mallets
theres really nothing i can add to whats already been said about this tuner
what can you say about the best of the best
product is as described and fits mic perfect
instead of hammering it out i used two screwdrivers to pry it out
these are very nice bright strings
it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea
which i have not tried
im a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s  vibe
i will probably buy a couple more of these
i am pleased with it
thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok
so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution
all of my 734 tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits
it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it
this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints
im still waiting on the return for this
add 34apogee one mic mount34
it works great not much i can say beyond that
reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit
the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys
a solid favorite around my house
either way once plugged in it sounds great
i use them when i play with my duet and sometimes with the band
i ran it through my swr california blonde ii acoustic amp
great mic for the price
the sound is great and is easy on the fingers
the string does not corroded but i changed mine anyway
it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid
this arm hold the weight of a atr2100 microphone fine
these will work for soprano
all in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point
i bet if you bought one you would like it
even without a boost i can use it for death metal
the major problem with these is they arent large
do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers
good cords with a decent length
this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp
i have owned two of these stands
you get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box
that being said i havent found anything i cant use it on
way more versatile than any other muff
i just received this mic today and tried it out
this my second hosa guitar cable
there isnt too much to say about it
but im a big fan of allinones
they stay on in their cases
put them on my daughters guitar and she enjoys them
still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job
they loop two strings together and i hate that
they should make a metal edition for that
if samson included software  itd be a 5 star product for me
this is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me
but they either sound badly are prone to electricalmechanical problems or both
what you would come to expect from lanikai
these arent usually my goto strings but daddarios are a good solid sounding string
they hold their tones longer
the same is true of a lot of audio gear
yes these strings are amazing
but either way i liked it and decided to keep it
everything is tweakable assignable and flexible
no big deal really unless youre a real tone freak
its too stiff not comfortable at all
you do not need usb to get this to work
got the marshall dsl 40 watt combo
this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there
if i used it a with a passive guitar pickup id want external preamp
this is a great little tuner and i recommend it
good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point
their microphones do a great job for little cost
they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers
i also find it very accurate
all joking aside these heads really are great
one star short of a 5 star review
as for the sound of the pedal its very good
it has a good range of overdrive levels
to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed
here are my pros and cons pros1
the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect
like the other reviewers on here im sad to report that its quite hissy
it was only about 15 at amazon and worth many times that amount
it works great on both very accurate and easy to use
for me this is perfect doesnt make any noise with my conections
onoff in either direction with full torque
fat and deep snappy when needed
doesnt hold as many pick as i expected
cheap to buy but cheaply made
i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under 200 new
this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster
as well as mute on every channel
high background hiss noise  relative to all 3
it has a great tone
i will buy some more of these
once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was
once installed they are fantastic
this liitle box works great for my needs
make things easier and cleaner looking  thats what
im not sure about battery life i havent gotten there yet
for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks
i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program
the tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful
after checking each string multiple times
my own opinion about this is i love it
im sure it will be amazing
well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars
i do like this set of speakers
i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little
he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain
i have been playing guitar for longer than i care to admit
at 20 this bag looks like a great value
i purchased these picks because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band
if thats not a problem definitely worth the price
this can give some cleans and drive to distortion
phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful
i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs
these are very good longlasting strings
no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it
great price for excellent sound highly recommend to everyone
this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound im looking for
its only fault is its price
now a days i read they are rebranded chinese tubes
thats really all its designed to do thus 5 stars
it is not variable speed
carefully adjusted to add littleno volume to the signal path unity gain
first it a great price  about the same as a big mac lol
this is a proven classic
these strings have made me a daddario customer for life
it seems like there is a short in it somewhere
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s
with that said this thing sounds amazing directly after install
its very sturdy and well built
i only use this microphone for podcasting
not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze
and the tone is very clear
ive done a good bit of recording over the years
i have yet to buy another set of strings
i dont know why more people dont use these  theyre amazing
i use for both electric and acoustic guitars
i mainly use it in 4 channel mode
i use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics
this makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices
besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost
nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad
if you have a minimixer you can do the same thing with that
other than that this is a great amp
i was a fender or daddario guy and eb ss were beneath me
seriously a 2db shelf in the highs
the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well
i like the feel and texture of these 34pics34
the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings
very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners
i like this a lot
most of my pedals are 20 to 30 ma
even the other players checked it out
i have two of these stands the electric guitarbass version and the acoustic version
this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality
you can use this with any usb audio interface
i got this to help with that
ive played 6 strings 12 strings bass acoustics and electrics
the electronics themselves have held up admirably
for many guitars including my j45 theres nothing ive found that ive liked better
my son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford
i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition
some love them more than any other string and some are like me
this is a great pick
my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks
in rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful
i find it handy useful and i recommend it
except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs
i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic
that was not the case
a needed accessory for any vocal recording period
i live on the 4th floor
so in light of the competition the focusrite looks kind of ok
i am very impressed considering the price
nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions
so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update
if broken or lostwho would steal it
the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking
i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good
lets say you use an xt or a x3
although the cloth i got was black and not yellow just pointing that out
if you buy this definitely havebuy a 9v adapter with a  polarity
this product makes your pedals super secure
very playable right out of the box and very beautiful
it tunes without any problems
buy one learn how to use it and youll be happy
i cant play real guitars
i ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago
the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected
the items appear as pictured
but i love the way screen and mount look
tried rebooting a few more times still didnt work
just be aware that 050mm is really light for most players
they are well made reliable and cost effective
these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look
a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark
i was upgrading all the chrome on a mim and put this on
i ended up putting the screws back in
i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button
great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply
went through two of these before i learned my lesson
did i mention it has a blue light
quick install works like a dream
it stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall
thats just how it is
these picks are really hard and last forever
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
these picks were a good deal
they were for a 20 uke
so i did thanks hde for wasting my time
this amp is non stop fun
this makes the unit useless
these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used
best buy on the market
i will only every buy herc stands from now on
even at that i consider it a good buy
this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund
im mounting it to a heavy duty on stage brand double x stand
it only says what the product does have
fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time
these patch cords work like a champ
come on tascam you can do better than this
ive used ernie ball fender prs just all kinds
they are light on the fingers sound great and priced right
im not sure how its possible
i am very pleased with this 1634 crash
the build quality seems questionable from mxr
on the female side probably one few out of many lets hope
although i only play for fun i still play 23 hours a day
i dont think that you would go wrong
100 picks for 20 dolares
every bass player should have one of these
i ordered spare batteries but havent needed to change one yet
he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well
get it if it fills a need for you and youre broke
i would recommend it as a good economical all around amp
i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp
some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but ive had no problems with mine
it does the job it was intended to do
bought so i could teach my son bass
sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement
no desire to test other strings
i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag
and the bx5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine
these sound great and last a long time for me
it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin
describing its sound with words helps but doesnt really do it justice
well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this fender amp
the weight is great for my style of playing
the clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built
the battery cover on mine fits very loosely
this a great device to put my genuine planet waves signature picks in
at that price its a steal
exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board
this is a really cheap microphone
but once open they stand up well
my experience with these straps has been great
i put the hybrids on the new les paul
and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price
that said do it wrong and plunk
it has a 18 mini earphone jack for private use
it also just looks cool and very pro
i sound like a rock star with it
i cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good
i have them turned all the way down almost
im not especially particular but do like good sound
you dont need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt
i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily
i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p90 pickups
this picks are comfortable nice quality
this stand feel sturdy and strong
but it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum
if youre considering it buy it
i am considerng replacing my takamine minijumbo with a seagull equivalent
the trem function works great
for the bread this is a great strap
it gives you great sound for solos
good padding for comfort i go 190lbs
combine that with the great product design and im a happy customer
i will be getting more
seen many different capos but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser
even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew
its okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new
it ends with a spin on 14 in or a standard 35mm
they work well for that
bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor
these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums
you can google it for better instructions
they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin
i dont hate boss and use their superoverdrive in my chain
we both been playing for about 3 months
i still love these things
always found the hangingtype to be the safest  most secure
beyond the halfway setting it wouldve hurt my ears
really wanted to like this one because i loved the price
it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg550xx
this is a great effect
installed easy and the screws and everything were correct
everything you need to keep your guitar clean and polished and sexy
i hope this helps your decision
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar
i bought this based on video reviews on the net
ive been playing guitar for more than 20 years
their mic stands and guitar stands
i guess this kit works okay but its hard to use
i used to use schaller straplocks but theyre not compatible with all straps
great little pedal for a very reasonable cost
easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connecthold very solid
plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it
after a week im already playing songs and im not a string player
this is a great tuner at a reasonable price
for the price however you should not expect any better
i worry the battery will fall out very easily
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acousticelectric guitars
love the all black look as well
when i take the batteries out no problem
but this is my fault i should have read the 1 star review first
great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to
i dont care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks
thats the price you pay for a flexible pick i guess
lasts a long time 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar
well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions
i knocked it to 4 stars because they dont match up
it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls
my stereo image even feels wider now
i keep one in each case
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
i decided to replace the saddle with this one
it nails those sounds well
in some situations they can be a savior during set up
the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand
these are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session
great for a quick practice and really sounds nice
i havent used it a lot yet but i really like it so far
some people may not like that
too much noise with one spot
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
also they are offered at 40 or 50 so its simply a better value
best sound on all instruments was obtained from 610 feet using the omni mode
and the result sounds really right
perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms
practice time just got better for your neighbors
kind of flat and lifeless
sadly when i tried to use them amp it didnt work
i recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have
and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band
id suggest buying them by the gross
3 downloaded the 650 mb zipped installer
the tone control alters the basstreble mix but not very significantly in my opinion
snark claims that its their best tuner yet
best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp
this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted
elixir strings are great for me
i just put theplanet waves pwct12 ns mini headstock tuneron my stratocaster last night
the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep
this is a great price for the package
lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound
its been great so far
the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set
its a small smart tuner
it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes
the sound is richer and clarity makes unique
seriously this is a great pedal
i am really loving it
very serviceable easy to use sturdy
thats why its so inexpensive
what can else can be said
my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower
will buy more when needed
these are great picks and yes they are slippery
quality is really outstanding for the price
i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great
one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb
every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers
excellence once again from tc
i also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument
for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around
this corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out
definitely provided extra gripping surface
i recently picked up an 812ce first edition 12fret
i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable
this is my second 4 way switch and it wont be the last
that was over 3 years ago
i use clayton 126mm picks a heavy pick but certainly not oversized
best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody
its confusing and i do gain or filter in my daw
i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great
still evaluating how that will work for me
i just recently started up learning guitar
for 20 you cant go wrong
this stand is built much better
they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones
but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal
dont play another show without these
the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable
very fast readout and fast on off
right at the upper lip works well for me
having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three
first impression of the guitar was terrible
its pretty harsh in tone  kind of a white noise distortion
maybe thats what they mean by balanced tension
nothing special just the will to get used to it
one just cannot tell the size from the picture amazon has
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each
it is thick and flexible at the same time
works great for the price
but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion
its good but doesnt really cut it if you want a great wah sound
i put these on an epiphone les paul acousticelectric and it sounds so great
it is quite bright sounding
what a great multipurpose guitar tool
feels solid and will probably last for many years to come
again i was very happy with the results
but daddario pbs are a great place to start
just wish the batteries lasted longer
it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet
well i love da fender products always have always will
true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound
works perfectly with ear buds with miccontroller
well see how long it lasts
no issues in over a year
i am very happy with how it performs in both situations
i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software
the grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that
it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding
the cover is supple and easy to coil
what more can you ask for
another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot
edit 10232012i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board
this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar
i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on
this is the best usb condenser mic ive ever used
not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better
however the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws
the tin is way nicer than the old plastic one
this is a great gig bag for the money
i would call the black ice picks medium sized
so this switch is a useful little bonus
my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion
once down you can pretty much count on an almost perment mounting
that said it works fine on a nonradiused ukulele
this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely
it is such cool and easy rest for the guitar
they took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event
this is an excellent strap
pay the extra money and get something quiet
construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis
if you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect
theyre fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug
amazon seems to have great prices and its nice to have them delivered too
well i have to say that it did well
on guitars it sometimes doesnt register on the low e usually moving around helps
i use this short stand for micing my guitar amp cabinet
i really enjoyed this tuner extremely fast an accurate at tracking you
the one i got is labeled both on the package and on the clip
quality can be found behind the fender name
so i want to keep a completed pack for back up
it fits easily into all the recording equipment im using
let me say three feet is short very short
buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment
i had to send my first one back
i have these on my jazz bass my guitar player has another brand
has worked very well so far
this gls mic cable is working well
it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz
i could not be more pleased with this product
you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want
it kinda wobbles up and down
they are plastic and will wear out someday ill buy another pair then
i think this tube basically brought the volume down
2 consistently use and replace batteries
i was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down
the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down
plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag
i am quite happy with the build quality
hosa products are a good bang for the buck
there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm
it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy
nice and loud in a small package
i8217m really glad i did
theres no breakin time required
5 stars for this one
so i hope all of this helps you with your decision
they make two  a 3430034 and a 3440034
that said i find it useful for composing on the road
after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case
either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost
this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings
shame on martin for such a piss poor product
they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect
not sure what thats about
and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweighthollowbody electric
im 511 i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still
but your tone will still stink
there is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke
works great for my acoustic dreadnought
for the price this is a steal
what more could you want
that would not make it a deal breaker
some guitars sound best with phosphor bronze
overall a very good product
tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect
when i mentioned light duty in the title i truly meant it
the direct sound phones block a bit more noise
rarely have to re tune with this one
just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical
for me the 11s felt a little loose
this mic is well made heavy on the micend
just use a smartphone to record stuff
they are a bit too small for my ears i guess
will definitely make any uke sound great
i think they might have made it a little more durable since then
a couple of the marshall settings arent bad either
in fact its about time to order another set or three
i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps
also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones
yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but its an amazing guitar
pros  works really well and is easy to use
this cup holder does the trick
a power conditioner will sometimes help as well
fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short
while youre at it buy ten sets
a true hidden gem thats actually cheaper than a ds1
love the price and they shipped quickly
it also lubes your strings
very cool design and looks good on my tele
they work good for the sound on the strings
i have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well
this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string
on the cannon the lever was vertical
on the e and a strings
im surprised that the maker of amazons popular at2020 would go this low
i highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others
ive got a couple of these and for the most part im very satisfied
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility
the built in volume knob it a great tough
gotta love these strings that just wanna sing
we purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the ukulele
the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on
easy to plug in i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband
the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above
i got the wrong size holder
for the price you cant beat it
i am impressed with daddarios electric strings
all latch well and look good
it works and i like
is it easier than soldering
now i just need to get used to playing with 5 strings
look up mxr phase 90 mods and eriks corner will show you how
dose not cut in your shoulder or back
the cable died on me in less than a month
you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp
it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range
i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite
im pretty much old school and like to find my own sound
also i couldnt see any effect between engagingdisengaging the tone button
it is my sons first guitar and he is learning on it well
ive not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking
bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc
i just wonder what other people have encountered
so far it doesnt look like it will though
this capo seems to handle quite nicely
i just prefer analog all the way around
the color is sort of a metallic red almost candy apple red
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
update  received 6 of these
i love these picks and the
i like tortex and this isnt but
the file is saved and then you can push playpause to listen back
theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves
this is now powering my entire effects board and its doing a great job
a fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from
they do the job brilliantly
i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap
i liked the string spacing on these nuts
runs forever on a ninevolt battery
this one is a good meet in the middle of those two
ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences
it sounds really natural and its easy to dial in a nice sound
it still would not install
but a new strap and put these on right away
3 tools in one handy spot
would not hesitate to purchase more of them if i need to
but other than that works as intended
these are exactly what the doctored ordered
i changing my review from just okay to contextually perfect
i hope you are getting the idea
still hoping for that harley though
thank you and say goodnight gracie
i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons
note it played well the way i got it just like my stuff perfect
very quality recordings so far
buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping
this is a great buy under 100
but it is perfectly adequate for most purposes
they most replicate a fender med
the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate
i also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents
for the price this product is ideal
not that its a surprise though
ive heard that these can be fragile but im pretty gentle with my gear
its easily 12 the thickness of any guitar cable ive used
the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip
if your a musician or want to be
this is a pick for the precision player
that is the function of an eq nothing more
this item does the job
i only meant to test it when i unpacked it
i can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones
when i asked music123 about this they said oh
these are okay strings for the folk guitar
and has 2 nice leds
i recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb
playing feel is fairly smooth for roundwound strings and they last for ages
i like a lot this pedal
one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button
its hard to beat this box at any price
ive used all the ins and outs with no problems
i use it with reaper
i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd
just make sure you get this when you get the tascam
the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke
the only thing i dont like is that the housing feels cheap
simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually
i am definitely proud of this product
this little tuner is made to be left on one guitar
34 then by all means knock yourself out
but only thumb picks work so i can use my fingers too
the surface is matte and not too slick
the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease
the g7th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose
the med is pretty stiff
nice size action and finish
it is the best playing best sounding 12 string i have ever played period
first and foremost  use single coils
ps  i dont review products that dont stand out as excellent
lastly these plugs are huge
i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one
would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument
but again for simple storageprotection its a nonissue
id also like to see another set of outputs on it as well
unbelievable instrument a pleasure play
011 strings are what i use
for the price i was really happy with it
i am going to be finding picks in my files for years
that should make me about 58
this makes the process so much easier
not the best but not the worse
this sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which i installed the pickup
their sound is bright just like their xl cousins
dont forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder
fast and reliable and accurate
my current band does not even play that many songs
this really eliminated many subtle flaws i had with audio recording
playing went from painful to pure pleasure
otherwise easy and a great product
anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill
im also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast andor recording audiobooks
all of the cables worked perfectly
the construction itself is ok
got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar
whenever i played with traditional strings my fingertips would turn green
now i have it put away and im using this one
i just keep coming back to these
the user dials in the frequency sweep they want
all that said here is why i decided to write a review
for a number of reasons
everything works exactly as planned
i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot
it is a nice looking cord
fit my 12 string with no problems
it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks
and on the mims fenders either cause both of mine are american standards
they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability
comes with everything you need except a drill or a screwdriver of course
adjustments are easy to make and the fitfeel is fine
this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths
this made actuating it a less natural motion
somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain
this system works just okay
i found that quality nice when dealing with
if i change my mind about anything i will update my review
this is my first real recording microphone
the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship
holds sheet music as it is intended to do
this pick is well designed for mandolin playing
ultimately you and your gear will have the last say
thank you godps for making such good quality products
suggestion   find a wall stud and use 3 screws for heavier instruments
mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use
rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like theyll last a while
hey its a pick its 10 to a bag
i purchased a second one after using the first for one month
rugged pedal by a little known company
73 for acoustic and the same holds true
it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar
that just means it will breakin that much more quickly
i did the same with these 3 sets
i used it in acoustic guitar and on the ukelele without any problem
its nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play
90 degree trs is a nice touch
the flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked
i was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes
unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death
they are very good tuners and i highly recomend any tuners this company makes
because its so effortless to hold i can focus my attention on other things
luckily i had extra and this didnt bother me that much
arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised
all the finish is excellent
i paid a lot more for the gibson and 149 bucks for this epiphone
builtin string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus
over the clean channel of the fender it sounds very full and smooth
many good capos have been made
the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it
very midrangey sound as well
a more odorsensitive person might feel differently
you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks
amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students
i would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap
whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord
a lifetime warranty means youll have it forever
hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for
plays sounds feels and looks great
overall this is a great board
so i ended up using it to hang my rock band guitar
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new
crisp tone distinction is just not there
that said its lovely to see the strings true in
perfect for clear loud picking
each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting
does the british sound succeed at that goal
i needed a stand at home and this does just fine
with a twang twing twong nothing wrong
highly recommended for the price
my verdict  awesome  it sounds just like i remember
i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it 5 stars
great little amp but get a tube amp if youre serious about playing guitar
does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar
pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this
it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast
tried it didnt like it returned it
it does not come with a mic clip
they are easy on the fingers
cant ask for much more than that
they have different wood grains
i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build
pulse there rocksmith endorsed lol
this is a roundwound string with a hexshaped core
it is my most used gear in my life right now
record using a headset or youll get too much feedback
this pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound
this product has a monomicrophone input and a stereo headphone output
the base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly
at first i wasnt sure what to expect from these daddario balanced tension strings
i am using it with a musicians gear music stand
put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string
i have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my strats
it will put the sound down
though it has no motorized faders it doesnt make my work uncomfortable at all
they explore quite nicely that way
spot on when used correctly inline with cables
very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price
anyway my pros and conspros1
i got this for my boss loop station but it doesnt work very well
my banjo arrived a couple days after i ordered it
his shipping team do great work
there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psusb
i continually look at it and cant believe i only paid 30 for it
turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts
monster cables are well constructed
ive had absolutely no problems with it
also these picks have a noslip grip
they feel goodsound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set
if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route
my hands sweat a lot so i really need the grip
they last for months without a change in tone
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs
but it does the function perfectly
sorry  i had rather not comment until it is used
for this pedal they went with press on knobs
sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa
the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfect
pretty great strap overall and i am very very much pleased with my purchase
i love them on my strats
same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it
these cords strike that balance perfectly
to me the warranty is worth it because of the price
perfect for restringing your guitar
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired
good product and got good price here on amazon
daddario is awesome if you keep in mind that theyre on the cheaper side
that speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product
they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break
it does the job well
on the other side you cant use boost channel without drive channel
these are high quality thick guitar picks
have used them for years
if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be 5star strings
it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos
more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for
its so much better than the elastic capos
i kind of wish id have bought that combo kit
you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model
i would see how this goes and update the review
they bendnicely and sustain just as well
i have no plans of changing brands now ive made the string switch
this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver
this stand is small compact and sturdy
i put these on a parker
theres nothing complicated about this purchase
for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better
they work great for me
it also looks pretty damn sharp
focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this
the pitch shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun
got it right b4 xmas thanks amazon
you can get a lot more for your money these days
i have used a different brand up until this purchase
this will work with my daughters ipod touch generation 4
to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat
no more misplaced or lost picks
from nasty blues to steppenwolf you will have it covered
the winder the cutter and the pinpull all work well enough
this one even has a pick holder built in
kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice
this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great
im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty
but without it i felt cheated
but its not light weight
pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand
guitarists have become a bunch of corksniffers
i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else
i think i would stick with the black color though
huge time saver and works as promised
it doesnt truly isolate each input
just ordered a shorter stand
i guess this is a decent description
i use it and my granddaughter uses it as well
very functional and easy to work with
8020 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out
youd be silly not to bite on that right
it comes with light medium and heavy picks
i trust the planet waves brand
folks this is a stellar device at a throwaway price
jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable
zero hum or buzz from the unit
ive been using this one for about a year now with no problems
the board itself is built like a tank and travels well
i really expected better quality for 3500 after such light use
i only needed one string but it works fine
but when i grabbed this pedal i was blown away
stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials
i will report back after three months
like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient
not high quality but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks
having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set
i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one
hand angle can also play a part in this
if your guitar has polypropylene finish which most do youre going to be fine
id assume it was made out of castiron or something instead of aluminum
very light very sturdy and at a low price
just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect
update ive lowered my 4 star rating down to 3
i did have to sand to make it fit
i will definitely buy more of these in the future
and yes this pedal will do that
i didnt need the fx
nicely sound it gaveup on what brand of strings you use
great harmonica rack for smaller harps
its does not appear to be of better quality
went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive
this case it built really well it has really nice plush interior
some sound best with 8020s
works well tunes tight and is cheap
works well pretty straight forward
ive done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter
so i will probably be using it on my electrics
now get out thereand play your heart out
i have a fender jazz bass standard
i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones
powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc
fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap
it has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp
i have had two for years
performance using the behringer was good
no more to be written joy o the american dream
having the built in gate is also nice and it works
but all in all works well
but you will find some gems too
sounds like a great concept and they seem well made
this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain
i was really surprised by this
again do your youtube homework and listen around and youll come to your conclusion
not too heavy and very handy for traveling
the look and feel of this cable is excellent
5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales
the construction is pretty good
the problem is it doesnt do both at the same time
they are extremely well manufactured they look great and are sturdy as heck
spend an extra 10 and save yourself the headache
i pretty much thought they were all the same
you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner
worth every penny mind you
the to800 gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank
decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di
twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping
i feel like they should name it the 34pedal porch34
the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning
in fact i dont think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours
these slide around in my finger to much right now
i narrowed it down to 3  korg aw2 snark sn1  intelli imt900
still in terms of grip they dont hold a candle to the max grips
cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime
this does what it says it does
i didnt change battery for more than 6 months
good deal just get it i highly recommend it
it feels solid looks like a real direct box
from experience they tend to just die without notice
for the price this is the best tuner out there right now
the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface
fits my very old acoustic just right
but when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic rocks
its performed flawlessly since day one
at 40 you cant go wrong with these pads for you studio
the picture wont show it but they are about the size of a dime
i replaced my delay foot pedal with the behringer vd400 analog delay
we never have problems with our monster gold cables
yes this pedal is made of high strength plastic
i am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth
why am i so impatient
great value  highly recommended
a spring clamp type capo would serve better
i will update in a few weeks as i see how long they last
i ordered this bench for last christmas 2005
very good price and looks like they will last awhile
needs little space another plus
they work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips
i told them mine was 20
you will only get a muddy garbled mess
i dont know about the
its a good banjo capo
i really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening
tuning is a breeze and is very stable
the outs are trs style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back
theydont get in the way when being used but look almost out of place
you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock
this little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size
at the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up
it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition
though  i like the kyser the planet waves triaction is super slick
id give this 1 and a half stars if i could
it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall
it does seem like it can break easily
when these slip away ill order more
it is smaller than a snark but not by much
i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me
i imagine ill stick with them for this machine from now on
ive read some complaints about this unit
this daisy chain worked very well for me  no problems yet
this is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest
i would not hesitate to buy them again
easy to hold on to
ill add it back to my own collection and upgrade the electronics
having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting
i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great
it is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way
poor on recordings unless youre looking for that
should have paid the extra 40 and bought the mustang  oh well
these will now be my default locks
fair to good wood materials and furniture good design
i defiantly recommend them for everybody else
the actual cable is horrible
i would suggest the snark sn1
like them and never an issue
these are working a lot better for me
almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost
these replaced the etb92 nylon tapewounds i tried
its not a deal breaker
i would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player
the spring is very robust
i can bend the gstring easier than a super slinky
overall though i am very happy with the way this stool feels
you can dial in some pretty lush tones
while it is very adjustable the intell folds flat which i really like
a rechargeable version would be good
these are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality
that is they may sound soft and cheap
it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano
i use daddario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle
i know it will come in handy sooner or later
if you like warm sounds you should see something else
ive always been partial to
what did i want for this price anyway
i recommend it to home studios also those who travel with recording gear
a good value box set of quality products
i love my laptop a thinkpad t40
if you dont mind the heft you will be pleased
they seem to get bad marks now and then
i would buy fromthis company again
they have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want
this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail
very responsive and never dull or weak sounding
much more fun than a black box
large enough to fit the fender tuners
and the top part isnt pink like the pic also as others have mentioned
please note that im not a newbie to this stuff
better strings are worth the extra cost
will hold any guitar that ive seen
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product
the cushioning is nice and thick as well
ha amazon rejected my first review because i mentioned a competitor by name chickens
this makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price
turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger
this stand even accommodates a double neck
i dont get a huge loss of tone but a little bit
banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice
i got this to plug into my computer
just feels right for the job
this is good for now
it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews
a few months later the high e string unwound from the ball end
i will probably always use these
i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made
it is also very easy to hold unlike the deans i have found
but im now a convinced snark user
overally solid pedal as youd expect from boss
i love this little box
my music partner says she prefers the way these silkandphosphor blend with her fiddle
the regular ts9 mode adds some low mids and a little more high mids
and another comment in 2013
all in all this is a great product
still for sanitys sake id position the stand close to a wall
this shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick
b  recorded dr40 printed to cd
its simple and very secure
very handy and gets the job done quickly
i bought this one and it works great
i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink
so i reckon each has to find their own
i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint
not much more can be said about these awesome strings
quality seems top notch design is simple and effective
although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs
and by similar i mean clip on
you will not want to go back to any other set of strings
ive tried and replaced several
i do like this pick as well
the toneprint feature is amazing
i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets
this mxl is usbonly 4448 only
if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it
plugs directly to the system or my miniamp
if you dont try one
i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear
takes the edge off the violin sound
imports often have threads other than 14 inch sae
these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently
nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle
it does the job well and is pretty large
get it youll love it
it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl
ive played guitar for over 10 years
the only way to find out for sure is to experiment
that was several months ago
it came well padded and was in excellent shape
they need to rethink the design
the switch is conveniently located on top of the light
every color and size youll ever need
many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed
i use it every gig now no problems
works and sounds really good
i will never do that again
same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap
try it you cant go wrong
and proceed to jam on maggot brain
lots of gain tons more than my boss sd1 wthe monte allums sd808 mod
it does it job very well
i got it for me and my dad
it will never stand in the position like in the photo
lightweight small simple to use and its easy to read in broad daylight
great for bending and awesome sound
foam padded everywhere guitar touches
ive been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now
mics i have tried yet
works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely
it is so durable filled with options
the c1 is probably the most universal of all the models
this of course doesnt have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing
i am a beginner guitar player
by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time
am sure you will too
i bought this after watching a professionallooking youtube demonstration of it
this is super warm and can get very trippy
it records what you sound like
the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly
some have two pedal effects some have 6
i bought two for 10 bucks each
id say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals
thats a huge range for any tuner
why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job
am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43
they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
the orange gearlux logo looks pretty cool too
the pictures are uploaded on this product page
makes tunning easy and fast
just in time for my first lesson
nonmarring adhesive on back wont damage guitar finishes
if you need this get it
ive also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands
it fails to sound right
installed as usual and tuned them
that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip
took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings
ive heard it compars to a fender tweed in tone
is working very good 100 satisfaction
but for 48 dollars im  happy with purchase
i bought a washburn rx40 with duncan usm
what does this add to the others
just a solid little mic holder
you never know what will happen at a gig
the best deal for recording beginners
and before you ask 34is it perhaps your output jack
the neck strap and the base are excellent
this product has improved my productions beyond its price sold
he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses
and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products
get this one and have no regrets
the sound is excellent the playability comfy
this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player
but i dont think youre getting 5x the sound quality
this will last a very long time
fender makes a nice standard pick
i bought it to use with my boss me70
but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume
if you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more
i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc65
there may be a concern about damage to certain finish
anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one
how many high notes will i be hitting on this baby
this stand is sturdy and my guitars 34seat34 like an anchor
any less and id look dumb
my uke does not fit well in the stand
i replaced a set of strings that were very used with these martins
adding to that is its convenient small size and being unbelievably cheap price
has a headphone out with volume control plug and play
i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from
but this mini tuner is just plain amazing
you start with 8 fxsubtract effect banks for
i can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand
obviously not everyones head and neck are the same as mine
it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out
the controls are intuitive and easy to use
things that i liked 1
now im glad i chose this one
the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing
but why not give these lighter strings a try
bought a couple of these to build preloaded pickguards for strats
conclusioni will be ordering more of these
you can always remove more material but you cant put it back on
not too thicknot too thin
buy it use it and be happy
seems like reasonably durable construction
be patient and get this one
a real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses
they are great strings on any guitar
but still 2x the cost of the jimi
you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise
each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky
great little piece of leather
these look like rollers but are not rollers
closing thoughts unfortunately there really isnt a usb interface that has a good driver
in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale
he says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality
i do have my eye on a martin though
i would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only
these cables are wellbalanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass
this 25 watt amp will get the job done
dont expect a 2 octave bottom because it doesnt do that
this is a great little tuner for guitar
the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others
this is my third purchase of this tuner
this is not an easy fix but it is doable
construction is fine and you can set it up in 30 seconds
so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest
it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal youll need
just dont drop one of these on you tile floor
they sound nice and bright and they last a good while
works great and no noise
made in germany  not china  these locks are fast and secure
i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment
check it out the reviews on youtube
i wouldnt be surprised if they are made from china
schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place
thats what you get with this
its all comes back to our ability to make good music
thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings
just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal
you cant beat the price for these quality guitar strings
maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it
i use this on all my guitars
this is easily adjustable and adds a depth and a nearleslie sound
i you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand
i like those better and theyre cheaper
its kinda small for my hand but it works great
but it seems lacking to me
should make a couple of different sizes
ive been using daddario xl nickel wounds on my pbass for a long time
at least thats what she told the police
the locking mechanism is great
so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on
a great product no matter what gauge string you choose
the jp02 frees me up from any other wall warts
i thought id try these out and i loved them
this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case
i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is
this is what i came to
i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal
if so then dont buy this sample pack
thankfully i still have most of these picks
if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you
i intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use
i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion
both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal
i really really like it
ive learned the hard way that there are some things you dont skimp on
quality strings at a very affordable price
and a volume nob that goes from low to high
purchased for my epiphone electric guitar
the only negative is the way they seem to be packed here
i have been using these for months now with 5string bass
this is not a wooly splattery vintage tone like the dunlop fuzz face
i can give these away to beginners that dont have a capo
only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as vaders
fits the instrument and old mexican acoustic and feels comfortable
the attack is second to none
i saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled korg
i bought a few years back and its still working amazing till this day
lightweight slightly awkward but provides good back support
so my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing
the sound quality is excellent
did it improve my life
however i am really liking them
save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand
picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed
they hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style
keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag
works well easy to install and take out
took one star off for visibility
is ready to give guitars several times its street value fullon competition
install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze
a must for all guitarists
compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal
ill probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon
thats the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal
these arent diamonds or gretsch but theyre fantastic
when i got the patches they were better quality than i expected
its well made and sturdy with a metal body
i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back
so although my cleans sound good they arent great
it makes tuning a breeze
if you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin
why else would you be reading this
small enought to fit on top of a table or under it
nope doesnt fit a squire affinity just fyi
thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine
some things are great values others are cheap
it folds up so small and yet remains very stable in use
i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine
for the price it cant be beat
it does what it should
ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists
i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly
good strings for my electric guitar
then come the newbiesa few models from mxl etc etc
just clip it on about the nut and tune away
a guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under 500
i promise you wont be sorry mcons  no power supply or usb cable
never had one go scratchy
i scored a virtually unused preowned unit for 50
this pedal is remarkable for useful tones
i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market
i used daddarios for many years
the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less staticlike etc
i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies
its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass
there are some annoying things about this amp
i am glad i did
durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack
i put a baggs ibeam pickup in it also
durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color
this is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money
these dunlop straploks are amazing
got no complaints over these
that iswhen i decided to get the dunlop polisher  cleaner
i have use this tuner for quite a few years
it lasts a pretty long while too
ive been using only kyser capos for many years now
i have one thats over 4 years old and still going strong
the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear
i gave it five stars
this dual splitter works perfect
i guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy
besides that its highly recommendable to anyone
they withstand a lot of play and i dont have to replace them often
the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most
honestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune
it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically
the retailer gave me some mediums
these are the best picks out there
i hate minimum word review requirements
the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound
what can you say about rosin
i bought a 12 string one in blk
simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end
rogue is musicians friends brand
for 99 of situations these strap rocks
and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare
i am using a vintage garrard turntable
the bottom line for me is  it does and it doesnt
its marketed as an overdrivedistortion
its more easier to pick the string
thatll make it loud enough for most bars
adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos
the lights started flashing and it got hot
65 deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model
ive used these strings for quite a while now
i like the playability of the
i highly recommend this cable
but not if you use such a device regularly as many homeplayers do
it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget
theres no such thing as a best string
so i hope that helps
i am very impressed with this unit
my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them
i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway
to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
ill make a video and post it soon
this unit is very small and tucks away nicely
the best 29 that ive spent in a long time
the ead are that tall capstans and the gbe are the shorter capstans
between the 1st and 5th fret i dont really need adjust
this keyboard is pretty dope
this happened at least three times already
simply the best picks ever for bass
not much to screw up
the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus
i have purchased two sets of the mini locking rotomatics
great product ive use them before and have always thought they were top quality
the packing way below average
purchased this for my son who plays both acoustic and electric guitars
added 08nov2010  the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing
i own a number of guitar hangers
will this replace a pro fret job
works perfectly with audacity and windows 7 plug and play
for the price i guess i shouldnt complain too much
weve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo
if you want great strings get fender strings
this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money
worked fine with cover off then replaced cover with new bit of rubber
nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks
also the price is right
but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections
ive had the same tuner for years
after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference
plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises
hence the purchase of the pedaltrain mini
all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared
i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well
it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me
this clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use
no problems with distortion or noise
such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy
best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals
pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit
if i wanted it on there tho its got a peel off sticky back
it also makes the strings feel nice as well
bought roughly 5 of these
0 6 7 9 and 12 are amazing voices
best price with free shipping
i had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up
they worked fine at a great price
i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube
this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals
im an older guy who has been playing for approximately 50 years
they do what they are meant to do
even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end
works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations
with this set up the second channel will distort a bit
after playing a while the set started to feel more natural to me
lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies
this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price
i also have the very first jamman with the add on 3 button footswitch
will just move on to another companys cord
its fine for the price
thats where this product comes in
it was my fault not to check out its measurements before purchase
i brought this for my husband drum set
most tremolos have it but not all
good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things
and then  yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy
youd be better off with a similarlypriced smalldiaphragm condenser and a windscreen
now thinking about an eminence deltalite 12 neodymium speaker in a 1 cu
i gave it 4 stars because it hasnt been maintenance free
this is an analog pedal an the only digitech pedal ive ever contemplated keeping
pros  they look very nice
its just as good as any i love the joyo pedals
this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88key keyboard
even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same
grips soft loose and yet well
the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent
that frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff
this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use
celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i dont
i wish id bought it long ago
tonewise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which i rather like
not to mention boutique quality at a working mans price
the various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing
call me a snob but i wanted these to match my fender stratocaster
looks great and plays great
but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong
these picks are bigger than i expected
ive used the sd1 with both singlecoil and doublecoil pickups
if you own special 20s then you already know how good they are
it feels heavy duty and stays still during use
i did my research on this buy
the build quality is great and i know that it will last
but good product and price
this unit is quiet and very handy
the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar
the great part about it is the design
i chose this because i wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings
the dr07mkii has worked well for over 100 classes recorded
if would 100 recommend this pedal to anyone
it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design
i havent banged it around but have had no problems with durability
throw some strap locks on it and away you go
i am glad i bought this
needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget
new to guitars but in 24hrs
seems like i made a good choice
it will still hold up with moderate use
not much to say about a chrome neckplate  its largely a cosmetic item
these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar
for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display
this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones
this is the second one i have and it works well
i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician
they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion
this a great cable for practicing at home
great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly 6 or more picks
ive been playing for more than 30 years
the stock tuners have one peg  these have two
it is actually a good little practice amp
i have always used daddario strings
i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two
if youre a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration
what more can i say its a sheet stand
its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie
it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too
this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned
1540 people like itwho am i to disagree
my advice is look for a more sturdy model
i would have expected it to cost much more
oh and and the cost
note that there is no guitar cable
not much of noise and practical carry
the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched
looks nice and quality seems nice
padded so does not scratch finish on neck
i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail
they all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers
it does hit the frets but doesnt seem to do any damage
we try to stay stocked in these picks
i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used
i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar
this is a really nice thick strap
they are ctls so im a bit confused
the snark is great and the price is amazing
thats because its designed for making solos stand out
bought another for my strat
highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar
it has a wide tone range
ive used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints
best ive ever found so far in a tuner
it will survive a nuclear blast
i also like the xlr connectors on these havent had one go bad yet
you really cant go wrong for the money
what more can a guy say about a little box of screws
why do i like this bag better
daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money
this speaker has a very clear full range sound
but first some details about the tuner
i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar
holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight
be sure to check out all the dimensions though
handsdown i like the dunlop ones more
this can be used to  semi  record music too
so given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem
i was not happy the super champ x2 didnt come with it
i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs
why not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffs
nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy
i use light daddaro strings and love the tone and feel
the rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone
good grippy picks for some types of playing
i liked it so much i bought a second
i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal
i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers
cant ask for more than that
the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand
you pluck your open string hard  tune as described above
a lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade
i dont feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job
and im so glad i did
but ive used it and its easy
no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested
this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described
i had alesis io2 express which did a similar job
they are made of plastic after all
this immediately lets them know to just speak into the microphone
find something you truly love and buy that
seems to work just fine for my needs
i used in all my concerts and its excellent
i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try
i  fits well in my hand and is well balanced
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
i also have small fingers and hands
use it every week at gigs
but in our case it works beautifully
keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size
its very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over
elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price
same with the metal amplug
also it may be a litle larger than some like
good strap at a good price
it is a good cheap addition to my effects board
the mounting process was simple
it cost 99 and i figured i got less than what i paid for
whats not to like here
i would buy more if i needed them
although not through amazoncom i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar
its not a riot but
and that my friends is the problem
i would buy them again
ive used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count
i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic
the shoulder strap tends to move while you play
it is perfect for mac or pc
its a guitar instrument cable what can i say
i can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the gb card
they are all awesome in thier own way
the nonslip surface doesnt take long to wear off but i have a workaround
was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash
point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me
it will mess up the finish
but then again i probably will try  to use it that way
i bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there or across town
it is barely workable for two
the amp gives an audiable pop when powered down
what to expect  with one drop the effect is immediate
almost didnt know what it was because of this
it makes the stuff i do in logic easy
the five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste
a good cable for the money
i like the price because of the special deal from amazon
bottom line  dont follow leaders
well built solid construction  zero complaints
i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better
color coded ballends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention
i never really got a chance to play them
now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune
you know what i mean if you are a professional
the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip
it feels great looks great and sounds great
so i cant comment about them
i can crank em all if i want to and go nuts
joyo makes great quality products  cheap
i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock
each song have a chart on which chord you will use
thats a lot cheaper than spending twentysomething dollars on an additional wall wart
this amp ranks up there with the best of them
i know others love them so i guess its just a personal thing
so dont buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use
this original plug fits the purpose perfectly
i am able to adjust it to the length i play with
latchedunlatched mode  the best feature on the pedal
i buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases
036 respectively which i can feel as well as a slightly thicker b string
pretty simple even if youre technically challenged
from there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as
i could use a brighter light
a great pedal well made
the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode
this mic in a studio application smokes them
i dont rate it 5 stars for the lack of vci
you dont want your instrument plummeting to the floor
blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product
and i agree and i add to that total
the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived
the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe
the 1w setting is perfect for my studio and the
i dont know why they are called big stubby
it is lightweight but is still sturdy
i was not sure about this at first
its a tad pricey but all in all well worth it
i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music
it seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around
i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination
i have multiple guitars for different styles
but they block sound so well you dont have to blast them
i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues
still you cant go wrong either way
the behringer cs400 is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc9 i discuss below
its made of plastic but that doesnt effect anything its pretty tough
ive used it  at both inside and outside gigs without any problems
no nasty residue build up over time
i love this thing love it love it
decent quality for the price
its fun to use and also very challenging
makes any guitar look so much classier
looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks
ive been using these picks for eight months and they last forever
which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring
ive never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion
i really dont understand why
these phosphor bronze models have found a home on my epiphone flattop
i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good
so if youre looking for a vocalpodcast mic this is a great cheap option
i just wish it had a little more 34give34 to it
when used correctly though it does its job just fine
firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet
its lightweight but very stable even with a heavy bass drum mic
i play guitar mandolin and ukelele
this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop
thank god i buy spares
for the money you cant get one that touches it
i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is
angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well
it has a ball joint construction
no dropping guitars around here
the chromacast also has many more pockets
this mic has convinced me to  purchase the audiotechnica  at4040
the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling
use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though
ive got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed
i would also deeply recommendsnark sn2 all instrument clipon chromatic tuner
the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked
put it up on the table when your picks are not in it
with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever
34  just get one that doesnt get in your way
easy to hang onto when strumming
its very articulate and gives you good marshally 70s80s crunch
it is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings
unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch
for my needs this one works
sounds much better than listening to the pcs normal puny speakers
when this product appeared to be defective i contacted the seller
the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up
these are really well made straps for the money
wow is what my teenage son said when he opened this on christmas morning
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
update 232009  these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time
i figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze
they work well and sound amazing
good little tuner at a steal of a price
great variety of uses for it
the very first appearance is impressive
i get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack
it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised
this is a great strap for the money
i have had some last a few years
im a professional musician playing 68 times a month
i did like the style size and color
the steel as expected has more of brighter twang
i purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason
the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot
all seemed to function perfectly well
and theyre fender so how can you go wrong
if you see a price drop below 495 dont buy
these were purchased for my sons guitar
well i hated each other one i tried
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone
each has a unique sound
i just used some 2 drywall screws
ive never had a problem and i wouldnt buy anything else
it is firm secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla
i use daddario strings a lot
dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible
they have been very dependable and easy on batteries
for the price you cant go wrong
the plastic tension section just snapped off
oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason
it is great and i kinda like the great look
first its construction is pretty light weight
love this capo on my electric guitar
you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low
they have 34punch34 and 34snap34 which are good things to have in a bass
buy it if you need a wall wart
the secondposition for the harp in c is g not terribly common
im using it for my alesis q49 midi keyboard
saludos  a todos desde venezuela
5 stars all the way
fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks
i like them so much that i own five
i have only had to replace the battery once
the grill and the frame around the grill are solid
although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction
would not buy it for my own guitar
i purchased this for my daughter who is 10
on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing
goes well with my black squier strat
it is only one hole and very small
i would recommend them to anyone
they are great you will love it
ive got them on my fender strat
definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
i have 4 guitars and they each get played once every couple weeks
good quality with sealed connectors
even my digitech rp255 has a built in 24bit audio interface
this thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well
the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder
consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top
not much to say here but is really nice to have around
my guitar thanks you as well grin
thats because youre hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones
this filled the bill works on basically any type of guitar
if you need a tuner this ones a good one
this guitar is probably one of the best i have ever owned
the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath
nothing fancy but simple and to the point
not perfect but a solid stand
i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar
they normally go dead in a week or less
plenty of cord to move around with
i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering
but not quiet up to par
i use mine for recording and some performance
i have more room and control with this pedal
this large pick  barely goes over my thumbnail area
i ordered this one and he loves it
if i lose it im buying another
for 169 you cant expect to have the top of the line
works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation
money well spent on this one for sure
it is very similar to a guitar in many important ways
i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal
im a beginner harmonica player and this was perfect for me
its a great and inexpensive looper
this is my goto guitar
most other recorders in this price range dont have xlr inputs
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
i even like it with the bass
i am user that likes behringer products
i think i have 3 or 4 of these
it also appears that the tuner wasnt reliable on the pitch end either
inexpensive solution and quite handy
looks more professional and i like that
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply
very well made of heavy metal framework
if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
the material its made of is good and it holds the guitar
they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise
the harmonizing function can be buggy at times
i also have the ns micro and thats a better tuner
great product for the price
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape
and ive been playing stringed instruments and ukus for quite a while now
i was previously using a blue usb snowball
straps dont get any better than this
i also have a small peavy 50 watt solid state combo
new strings have never been easier to install
the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position
its bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music
this stand is very sturdy well made  durable
but they really are cool little stands and i just bought another one lol
they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead
the body and buttons are plastic but solid they dont feel or look cheap
like a cranked tube amp
cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound
and i have to really hammer on them to trigger
but id mic it anyway
the output impedance is less than 10 ohmsrespectable but not amazing
occassionally there are problems with this set up
throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rockblues
the sound is unbelievable especially at this price
i like daddario strings but these did not impress me
and the es57 is equal to the shure sm57 at 6000 less
it works fine but its inconvenient
however the manual shows exact settings for computer use
since no two distortions sound the same
matches perfectly with other boss pedals
you must use the headphone jack on the interface
quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence
had to return the first one
i wasnt expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise
i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit
it appears to be indestructible
it offers ample volume for small venues
i will be buying one for every guitar case i own
hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good
i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned
but they may work fine on lightly braced guitars
great for any zep fan
i love this guitar strap button
we didnt really expect much except a quick way to record ideas
it was my first guitar
also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly
fender has done an amazing job with this amp
this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words
no they do equal to my boss counterparts
it is part of 34my sound34
this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone
they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality
there is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive
they are all very well made
however it worked fine and gets the job done
however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations
i bought these for the soprano ukulele i bought for my little great niece
but darn it this is one amazingly nice pedal when i consider price
the best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3pack
im not a fan of shaped les paul cases
it doesnt have much value on your belt clip
i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone
other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate
fast response on all strings including the low b on several five string basses
couldnt go wrong for 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility
this is a very secure and almost comfortable
no metronome but thats what im keeping the korg for
otherwise spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting
very well made although the bag is a little lower quality
yeah theyre more expensive but theyre worth it
maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument
it will bring the extra juice you need
set your guitar down on it by accident when its plugged in and
cables even good ones eventually break
smooth but not dull sounding
its all about personal preference so
i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet
one final note  these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage
not my style but they work ok
just clear as a bell
purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that
found pedal wasnt engaging when pushed down
it is sturdy and small
the price was also very good
this thing is a little jewel
this pedal is 998 sounding like the mxr
i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music
and its got that new guitar smell
plugged in it really shines
but without that i dont think id notice the difference with normal listening
weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down
aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound
only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back
this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it
no for the nuts and bolts of the thing
ok quality and certainly better than a piece of rope
i think i may need to tighten some screws
its a great cable for the price
it has several presets to emulate different sounds
when i got my martin soprano which wasnt cheap it did the same thing
i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review
well i got a recording without sound
the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand
work well to stop pops and lisps
these picks have served me very well
and the sustain is improved
it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional
it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic
jams and festivals bluegrass folk whatever became seas of intellitouch tuners
the handle gets real sticky and causes problems
this is what fender calls blaceface clean
very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range
dont even think about it
i leave them on my 12strings and one of the 6s
its a dinosaur but has a great tone
it works fine for the handy type recorders
the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent
it didnt seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless
im glad i bought it just wish it didnt come with the stains
im a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play
it saves room and makes the room look cooler
it can do anything and sound any way you want it too
there are many clipon tuners but i liked the following about this tuner 1
it is very sturdy and very stable
nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat
it was absolutely worth the small investment for me
its easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not
i have been using audacity which is a free download
they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with
be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off
soft touch easy care  cant beat it
these do it for me
all strings must be kept clean if you want them to last
i got a half dozen for christmas and was thrilled
my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s6 and i really like it
i have no problem with it but the hola
while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and visversa
this came today and i must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly
specifically it has an output impedance of 50 ohms
to me for the price its made cheaply
i dont just love the products
they are easy to play
i have tried several different brandstypes of tuners in my 13 years of playing
it seems as accurate as my other tuners
loose grip little sweat slick finish
i couldnt be more pleased
ive found that the light picks
just nothing with the name joyo on it
the thin soft gold 510 microns
i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough
it comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plugin cabling
but i do like the rotation of the display
i like to ride my bike and take my uke along
on a dark stage this works great
it has truly elevated my playing a few notches
it really gets around and tunes them all
bought this for my son
they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case
but for speakers or other static applications theyre just fine
no matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound
the tone last longer than any other string and they dont break on me
this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallowbodied ovation
all in all great value for a good item
3 for under 40 was fantastic
maybe i just need a shirt with more cling
they are durable and have a nice tone
very flexible but solid feel to it
weight and sound is the same
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you
i have them in purple which makes them stick out
these cables arrived in good working condition and weve been using them continuously since
it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast
very clean sound very versatile
they work no issues handy to have on hand
there is a headphone jack which is why i bought it
id consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 14
i cant really tell the difference between the sn1 and the sn2
this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness
they last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular noncoated strings
great little stands at a great price
for 100 usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for
i consider that to be excellent customer service
its not muddy and very clear
60mm nylon picks as my current standard  but decided to give the lighter
honestly i wont restring my fender with them ill use the fender 250 bullets
overall great entry level interfacesound card
works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument
no more need for a pedal based tuner
good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts
the products work great applied them to my new les paul ukulele for protection
but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too
i suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version
for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal
the music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion
i would buy another one without hesitation
it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also
i have an esp eclipse
i pretty much just leave these on all the time
as i said this is small but really not a toy
i got this for my line6 pocket pod
make no mistake the athm50s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
when done simply tap again and the led goes to green and plays back
finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot
he mentioned the need for one so got it
very rich bass that really comes out
if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case
it is ok but it does not compare to the ergo holder
less time tuning  more good time playing
they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order
and they look professional too
all connections are 14 mono
your h2 wont die during recording because the batteries give out
full range achieved from 6 to noon
i am looking to change if i can find something else
thats what i always say
while it isnt it the prettiest guitar out there its by no means ugly
these strings are good especially for the price
they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy
replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand
they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto
and it is not a toy
with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound
i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there
this system does not fail
humidity  not a problem with this stuff
great for the desktop and vocals
i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine
this is a cheap and easy upgrade
well designed and made from descent enough materials
otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years
these tuners look and feel great
i look for guitar cables that will last
fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording
i had to have one
it is loud and the screen is easy to see
i have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable
no background hiss very good clear sound crisp no distortion excellent transmission
it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner
tension is perfect for my washburns
the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts
i dont know why others rated it as a 4 star
the dobro had the issue with the strap didnt have a great connector
the amp simulation is top notch
mine came flattened in a little box
no pedals needed with this thing
sound in my opinion needs some tweaking
it gives a variety of sounds
the picks were exactly as described
while the delay is surprisingly good you cant customize it
it worked great for about 46 months and then broke
its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed
but if playing on the street corner is your thing
not quite perfect but a good value for the money
ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion
i purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap
these are a staple on every single guitar in our band
no damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings
how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating
just gotta love that vibe
i havent tried many different strings
my only qualm is that its gator brand and gators remind me florida
it is similar to skb and fits my guitar very nicely
i have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there
the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet
i have used them for years and always buy the same model
they dont come much better
ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this
i dont notice much difference at all though
it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar
even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end
these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy
i am now a diehard takamine fan
works very well and is portable
its cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well
they are picks for guitars and they work
i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it
the ds1 usually hurts my ears but with the cm2 behind it sweet
everyone has their own preference and i just didnt like the feel of those
regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing
sounds great with an electric acoustic
channel switching is a breeze with almost no delay
the effects are hit and miss as well
the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm
i have never had it go out of tune while playing even when stringbending
i hooked this up to the output of my mackie mixing desk
i have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years
i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from
it does pick up percussive noise which you dont get with under saddle pickups
at this price these cables are a bargain
whether dubbing audio recording instruments or just yelling at the top of your lungs
these are good strings for a good price
they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics
at first i was not sure what i was looking for
nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesnt work
sound was good and it was easy to set up
pretty well in tune up the neck
contrary to the name it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer
much better than plastic ones especially if you stay in the light thickens
the only problem is that the effect wears off quickly
three knobs to control tone level and distortion to get that perfect sound
this tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion
just gives you a mellow reverbish echo
i have found the perfect strings and these are not them
these stay in every case i own
steel shaft will probably last
it was the perfect choice
low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned
the best od i have ever owned
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
i really wanted this to work but it doesnt
i have bought several of their models
i have a long way to go
whatever good things youve heard about the at2020 is probably true
if you use strings you should buy them your damn self
i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar
ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing
and if you blast your music the low end distorts
yeah im the only one that sees that problem
it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument
they should last 34 months  you dont do anything else
i plan to stick with them
it works good and that is all i need
needed to get mic into computer via the usb port
i recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal
what they sound like and play like is the most important thing
my hunch is that a good powered 4port hub would be equally effective
the legs are easily removable for storage
i finally purchased an ebow about a year  ago
use them for home recording  nothing on the road
this is the best capo we have out of three
these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price
however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible
but over all this amp is a most welcome deal
this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does its job
its really an excellent pedal
i bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice
the capo is very easy to use as well
the classicmodified switch is pretty cool
i will always have one of these on my board
no way this thing cost lest than 40
he says its great so that is my review
this capo is inexpensive and works well
i dont require professionallevel equipment so this cord serves my purposes well
this will be my beater mandolin at 25 nothing can beat it
if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts
it is exactly what it says it is and works fine
mine did not have this problem
i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good
a local store wants 2999 for one set of these
i gigged with it for years without issue
i might get another one for a backup
havent got to far into this thing yet but i do like it
every strap is a levys
it doesnt have that 34cheap34 feel about it
also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily
and the price was right too
its a flange pedal what else
this one is also super accurate and allows you to really finetune your instrument
very comfortable and looks great too
heres the thing i am an amateur
ill definitely be buying more of these
yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this
my big nose cant confirm that
this recorder is okay but its far from perfect
usb only provides 5vdc and phantom power usually requires 1848vdc
these are the best tuners for the money
the package arrived on time
but at this time i am not sure i like what i have done
im glad that i bought it
i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply
it probably stretches 1012 feet if you really need it too
i own dunlop kyser and g7th nashville capos
my thumbs dont have a particularly excessive diameter either
this thing can get really loud
plus the humbuzz is so loud you cant hear anything from the microphone
i would highly recommend any plant waves cables
ive bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit
the truss rod was completely loose
great guitar by the way for the price
after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks
it is also a great value for what it does
you get what you pay for
other than that great strings
not sure how well it holds a tenor since i dont have one
i then let windows 7 plug  play the drivers no disk needed
had no problems with this cable though
possibility created by the multiflex feature and the grip
id love two more ports
no noise and very durable
they look great and fit perfectly
the solution may be this zoom ms50g
there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand
well made reasonably priced as with most on stage stuff
i installed this pickup myself
the most diverse pedal i own
if youre even thinking about buying this just buy it already
they were much louder and cleaner
quality and value all the way
so it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for
i like a flexible pick and these at
great value for the price
if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound
i have a planet waves strap with studs and i like it very much
34ukulele34 mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes
rogue g10 10w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing
not everyone would have those
my wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing
id buy another in a heart beat
it matches my awesome at2035 microphone
the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about
makes the fretboard look and feel nice
prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses
perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyones pedal board
i have been using these strings for the last 7 years
sometimes the simplest design is the best design
this discipline once a habit is good enough
they play well and last reasonably well
i have two small grips though
this little tool will prevent that
they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price
they are both great pedals that i use all the time
to me thats a perfect combo
my friend left a thin pick and i tried it
its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week
these take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm
the amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior
and the price is very affordable
turned it down and the sound got much better
its also squeakily noisy when string winding
amazon comes through again on price and product
this is because prior to the mid40smost strings were made of nickel
i cant believe i never thought of buying colored cables before
its just hard to get a clean sound out of it
good leather good build made to last  and age nicely
its the least obtrusive and best capo ever
it doesnt come loose or wiggle once in place
it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings
in my opinion daddario is the standard by which all other strings are measured
i have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud
what im loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like
id recommend to save some money and buy something above 200
ive tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated
or go buy a k kustum and quit your sniveling
this is a hitormiss product
at standard mp3 128meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours
will keep on the side for next guitar
i have nothing negative to say about this
when the president gives a speech the sm57 is there
ive always found daddario quality to be great
now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer
best purchase i have made
fits great easy onoff easy adjustments
this was for a friend who plays guitar
some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly
these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver
i love reverb and wouldnt buy an amp without it
so no comments as to its toughness
i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall
i love their flexibility options for colors and ends build quality and price
by definition medium is an in between size
this is the first time ive used the dunlop straploks system
compared to my g7th which costs 3 times more it is a great buy
adjusts easily nice quality leather hookups
the amazing thing is that the switch from intellitouch to intelli wasnt gradual
all three of them have held up with no issues
works well even with a room full of noise
these seem a lot more stable than the 1046 i had been using
this comes complete with bridge saddles and full size block
i have countless delay pedals and racks
clean the effect is a little weak
could i pull off amazing licks that i couldnt do with my normal picks
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools
without this tool i dont think i would have been so lucky
will order again if needed
it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
included with the amp is an owners manual with simple startup instructions
i really dont have anything more to say about it
compliments my bwb pickgaurd nicely
one thing you will need though is a phantom power unit
cheap price and does the job
no i would not take it on tour
but this is true for most strap lock systems
this is a good neck rack for gigging
if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery
we bought three of these and they are just great
a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire
these really are direct replacements for the prs se line
its durable and works perfectly
if you like acdc you would like this
the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well
this tabletop mic stand works
came in a timely manner from sam ash
i like cool gadgets  and this is no exception
but its a fine guitar
i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works
its a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose
these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them
this purchase is the very reason why im looking to buy a wireless system
leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button
the lil suckers are all about tuning  stability
i have used the exl115w set for years
these mopads are pretty amazing
providing the brackets to mount
but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell
and was way cheaper then the line6 adapter
when i tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent
a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings
for the price you can not beat these
it looks very neat and tidy
i got this duet2 instead of the singlelight version as most kindle users do
this gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique
this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig
i decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls
if you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board
great pedal and great value
i decided to give it another 24 hours
im super happy with my joyo pedals
i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china
i usually only have to change my strings once a month
my take on it your mileage may vary
it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me
its fast and easy to use
love it love it love it
this filter is awesome and for the price cant get any better
you want that go waste your money on a line 6 or something
but otherwise i think its great
for the price this is amazing
it took weeks to receive them in the us
if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while
this pick is so good to play electric guitar
the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate
compared to my other tuner its rigt on the money
i know tone and have had great and not so great gear
this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments
from the looks of it it complements the instrument well
electrons go through it and dont leak out so its perfect i guess
the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping
i love my teles but i cant stand fender strings
i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythmlead work is required
ive wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently
it even comes with a case with two zippered sections
however this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion
the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me
so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument
work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use
great mount for the price
for this price you will be satisfied
but gorilla snot worked beautifully
it is worlds better than usb mics like the blue snowball
this is too short for most adults that play guitar
i bought this pedal to semiretire an older ibanez ts5 soundtank
i purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the behringer uf0202
for my first gig bag its ok
even if this one doesnt last ill keep buying more
nice cables for the price
this microphones quality is amazing
the good inexpensivecontains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etc
always have a few spares that have been tested
now thats a fun king wah wah
these are great for sure
i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great
it is reliable and rock solid
a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar
the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions
originally i bought another snark and liked it well enough
i also dont care for the color coded rings on the strings
its just not strong enough
i use a onespot plug to power it
the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however
got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either
watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok
built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage
these strings are performance value and always give me a great sound
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
ive had this for almost a year
the winder is a little awkward to use
the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome
it works well for holding up a guitar and it looks good doing it
i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky
they seem bright yet still soft
i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i didnt
obviously behringer cloned the mackies and did a good job
just thoughtyou ought to know
that helps you understand a lot
what works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another
the sound is lets say
it has always worked well for me
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
ok  i like this one a lot
my first experience with levy and completely satisfied
sure its nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily
it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but
this guy not so much
any brand that works well at the right price ill buy it
you can do partial capos with this one
so far they are great
they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds
considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds
good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly
id definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon
but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate
luckily i bought the three pack
they cost a little more than other strings but theyre worth it
with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised
the real problem began when i switched to different strings silk and steels
i was really impressed by the sound
then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town
for the price the honeytone cant be beat
okay they are not high end but i didnt need high end ones
very big saturated and warm
not so with the spider iv
i will not shy away from epiphone anymore
i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
every couple months i change something making upgrades
despite this installing them was quite easy
the bench is comfortably padded and very affordable
the trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser
planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior  can pay
i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick
i hate their new packaging
fit my mim strat perfectly not much else to say
i had the ones that came with my strat which i believe are schallers
you can get excellent instructions and tips on youtube
vox has never really made great modeling stuff
if youre even thinking about it just do it
unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop
i have not switched form martin strings on that guitar
using george ls makes it look even better
was very pleased with jp 600l pb acoustic guitar strings
somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom
just two controls one for volume one for compression
the title says it best its a decent basic mic cable
i no longer lose or misplace my picks
dont know why i waited so long to get one
and it was necessary to the group
and works well for it
height adjustment was also important
this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value
the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand
also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove
this does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment
so i ordered this one to replace it
with high output humbuckers you still get some mild tubelike overdrive at zero gain
it fits snugly and is adequately padded
mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones
the 400 has reverb on the pedal
i am more than please with what i have received
remember to have wifi in order to connect to panadora
i can get a kyser or something for fifteen bucks
to be honest im not missing anything
if you are looking for a small plug and play amp
and possibly an envelope filter at some point
im really happy with this daddario purchase
so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me
ive also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages
only on first 4 strings may be
you cant beat these for the price
it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy
i am pleased that they match my telecaster
i like it and will use it again
if youre a roadie for a big group i could see the need
i have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon
these have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others
i didnt put it down for a couple of weeks
the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable
this one really appealed to my son because of the front design
a good polish cloth is a must
having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation
you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product
probably not needed on this pedal
i went back to my planet waves cable
and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included
just be sure to use a good quality speaker cable like the gls
if you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well
id pay double for these strings all day
save your money and get something better than this
its a bit thinner than the average cable
i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these
only issue in tuning drop d or b on a 5  string bass
i have made them last up to 2 months
volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4
good deal for the price
because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary
well this cable certainly didnt last long as the title says 8 weeks
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money
prosportability easy of use and set up
ive played guitar for 5 years
id be satisfied with the daddario they do sound good
their tone is slightly bright but not as 34harpsichord34 as the exp
the back side will shed for a while before settling down
a value and a half
i just bought a dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggy
there is no close second
senneheisers evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look
ghs allows me to minimize that
it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself
then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them
however the sound left something to be desired
switch is a soft switch so there is no click
i just save the fast 34lower played34 songs for last
seems to stay in tune pretty well too
the speaker w 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it
i have not had to replace mine
my fret board looks so good to
it is not too tight nor too loose
it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in
this is the 2nd set of these fender parts ive ordered
with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it
make sure your mic holder fits
it coils nicely and has good connectors
every once in awhile ill step outside of my box
but i mostly play punkhardcore and blues which is does very well
the usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe
i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different
a few minutes of rehearsal with it and youll get to like it
increases projection and tone to any stock strings
i have several different slides glass brass steel short long etc
adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument
its holding a gibson les paul so it has to be trustworthy
any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive
youd be dumb not to get one while theyre cheap
this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and doubleleather ends
this orange micro crush amp lives up to its name
these daddario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking
i have found the stand to be very stable
i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make
others complained about this and they were right
they do what theyre supposed to do
and for its price outstanding
this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding
overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly
and i am so glad i did
but the adjustable clamp is really
i was concerned when i first open the package because of its size
i have them installed on all of my guitars
the case is now entirely metal vs
good deal as backup capos
dont forget  practice practice practice
i really like the new container
these are good quality cables at an economical price
however i hate the plastic housing and how the inputoutput jacks are located
it is also very sensitive when set to room recording
i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away
they also cost about twice as much as equivalent noncoated daddarios
it also occasionally fails to register at all
of course the color coding is a godsend
yes its a pain in the butt
im so proud of my balls
i received my cables very fast
it let me know that i am not a techy
this is the last one you will ever need to buy
i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players
these dava picks are very nice
gls cables are quality cables at a good price
when inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage
the lo contour knob doesnt increase the amount of bass produced by the amp
i bought it without hesitation
this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues
the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well
for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill
bad news   these aquila strings are not standard on some others
the interface is great and the clip works well
wire frayed at the right angle jack
but the rub is their nonadaptability
they work great were easy to assemble and not expensive
i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly
and find a nice set of strings
we can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future
other mics i own dont have this problem to this degree
as capos go this gets the job done at a good price
our son says its easy to use and has a good sound quality
this is what im talking about  cheap but very usual form behringer
great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics
get it and see you will be blown away
this is a handy little tool
cut them to size and stuff them in
the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp
i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars
what can i say i am a string snob
actually its loud enoucht for home
ive been sad ever since
i would call it average
works just like its supposed to
they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick
i think the build on these are fine for daily use
for the cost you cant beat it
others may feel differently i am sure
as of now this is my favorite piece of gear
ill never buy this brand again
this one is just a waste of money
very easy to take it off holds the strings tight
i use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar
i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic
doesnt reduce sound worth a darn
looks like planet waves hit the mark once more
has great pockets to carry your picks strings and tuners
soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue  muffled audio recording
try daddario instead love their tuners
no need to replace these pickups
came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd
forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand
this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified
i would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication
there are better out there but its a good value
well its a solid chunk of metal
it is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock
this stand is very good
if youre wondering how to get neutrikmogami cables cheap make them yourself
the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird
im happy with this purchase
you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time
really a major chore to get over a strap button
theres enough reviews on here that state the obvious
i was shocked when i got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was
but this was a great package deal for this price
first off if you are planning on buying the us322 dont
i would recommend something thicker for that though
it not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality
they also sound good with any settings i use
it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric
second unit too had the similar packing but no damages
the tuner is very accurate and compact
they do what theyre built for and are as described
i only play elixir strings
the action is very good and it will not be any harder to play
two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability
now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines
5 feet 6 but actually are 10
i use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc
be careful when you hang it though
still using it today 2 years later
pretty sweet guitar for the price
i did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
i have not encountered the dye running yet
folks this thing is built like a tank
the tried and true shubb works great at a great price
all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days
originally putoff by the low price i went with the reviews
people are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish
no issues with the screw not tightening either
will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only
excellent quality and is very comfy
it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more
what will they think of next
this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319
the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar
just make certain you get the height correct so your action isnt too high
at this point i give it 2 thumbs up
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
you can easily set your intonation with this little monster
got the fender ft004 instead
these strings softened the tone which i wasnt looking to do
i was amazed at the tones i could pull out of it
the sound is so warm and bright
first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression
it works great and looks better
i dont play my martin very oftentoo busy with electrics
a great item for the price
it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing
played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better
epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar
i bought this amp along with a epi les paul 100
the strap would constantly fall off
i prefer no cheap imitations
give good crisp and live sound to my acoustic guitar
and has nice high quality chorus effect
the oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl
instantly i was in love
sticks are well organized and always in reach
im back with my wood block and am happy
not much of anything is worth the money these days
mic stands can be a hassle sometimes
put up against these i fail to distinguish the difference in sound
as long as the guitar is on it works great
i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the athm50
but i was annoyed that they  the bushings didnt fit the standardvintagesized
this sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off
buy a clipon tuner too
it did work for awhile
it even fits my acoustic 12 string
i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost
ive been hooked on daddarios for quite a while
it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances
pros price pointgood clean audio quality when working
univibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting
overall this is well worth the 500 that they list as the msrp
shipping was free and fast
with these strap loks the strap never comes off
because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice
this is my second makala gig bag
it works as it should and saves time
all in all not great this tiny stand
i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele
i have a 5 watt combo amp
i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button
i must now rerate it with a 5 star
time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick
yes there many banjos and some with more frills
it also has a different size connector
it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do
expansion kit from what ive seen
great at this price too buy several
if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam
in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box
and the price is right too
best thing ive bought for my ipad in a while
the c1 fits the mount perfectly
sound really nice on my taylor 410ce
34 especially since its designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously
i love my profire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong
one of my favorite picks ive tried for electric
i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input
the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well
they last forever and do not lose the strong holds
and silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board
good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets
it was wellconstructed with all the connecting points working precisely and securely
but you can get them ultimately
i paid 50 for it and it works great
most small tube amps dont have built in effects
it sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords
ive used gls products before and they are good quality for a fair price
i bought this since i am a new guitar player
elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar
its a little stiff and im sure it will soften up upon more use
how many of these types of noise boxes do we need
but ive broken two of them
for one thing your ears wont ring
i cant find a modern sm57 with a switch anywhere
second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy
the only downside is that it doesnt stay tuned for very long
bought a few while back and just bought a few more
the installation takes 2 minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play
and the tweeters sport silk domes
buy youll love it and if not you can always return it
this one fits the bill
works great  great price  meets my requirements perfectly
i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux2
ive used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles
the boss ac3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator
over the past couple of months ive been replacing guitar straps
it has less granularity in the display for example
after all whos playingand getting paid for it
this is one of the top delay pedals the pros use
it gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price
they are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems
wait you can call people with an iphone
the guitar rested too high for my liking
you can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higherwatt amp
my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capos design
if your looking for the best
anyway this capo works well
this little instrument tuner does everything
looks great on the guitar and works really well
for me this is the best guitar tuner
the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked
tried everything i could but its gone
its also truebypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off
some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic
they last a long long time and are surprisingly easy to grip
that would have been perfect
you wont be disappointed if you do
my fingers have stopped turning green proof that the product works
no more hiss no more static
i have no quality issues with them
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
es el output original de fender
this one only tunes in the uke keys
im using it for so many things including a music player for my truck
not remos fault but it is something to pay attention to
it has exceeded my expectations
just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner
honestly if i had it to do over i would skip this particular strap
it does twist around a bit when you handle it
they must stay in our universe
ill update this review when i get the new amp later this week
its handy having the wire cutter built into it
there is no click assuring that the cable is in place
how does an amp just come down half price over night
like the retro tweed look and the sleeves that go under the ts jackets
despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me70 does have features that recommend it
this strobe tuner is cable input only
very smooth and lasted me a while
no scratches or anything on my taylor
works perfectly with iphone and ipad
the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go
one u never have to worry about breaking them
daddario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for
i purchased this pedal with good expectations
to me they didnt feel right
you can set it to sustain for days
i bought these recently and i love them
when i first started playing i loved the coated strings
even though i ordered large
on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series
but thats yet to be seen
compared to the tortex style pick material 1 mm for the tortex
my connections were on and off i thought i had a dead pedal
no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there
for years i have fell more and more in love with my yamaha cgx111sc
it is so soft and comfortable
the monitor is powered so theres a power cable as well
thats okay hes got competition and ill be purchasing from them instead
they sute my needs just right for the takamine acoustic
i like this design better because of one simple fact
it sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches
the microphone works without it
some models suffer fits in certain situations
all in all a super amp
it is a concert size which i like
a very good deal at 15 clams
for the price i feel like it is a steal
these strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat
it cuts your changing time down drastically
2 make sure you know what length you need for a cable
also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings
read the other reviews this is a really nice value
i really appreciate the cutaway
i bought one then i bought two more then i bought two more
the tuner has an autoshutoff function to preserve battery life
to my ears this is a sm58
does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick
goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now theyve updated its look
not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still
got these stands to hold my guitars they are o
i feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones
i also have a boss tu3 pedal tuner
quality work was put into this thing
the cable is good and normal
ive only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so
i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine
it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning
it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved
our thanks to daddario for their assistance in satisfying this customer
they function well and are inexpensive
theres no heavy reverb there
intonation is good and ive noticed less breakage as well
when unplugging it just be careful and itll last a lot longer
the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow
for any beginner this is the guitar i would but in there hands
just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection
big mistake it deadened the sound terrible
that tube is an excellent storage tube
i know it will live up to the finder name
smallest cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find
the case is nice as well
otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars
rock metal shredding and even country
glad i got this one
gibraltars model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time
doesnt seem to put undue pressure on the guitar
i had them on my yamaha fg700s
i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out
the keys are 85 of standard width which is large enough for fumblefree playing
in the studio i wont use this pedal for that reason
over the years ive literally owned dozens of electronic tuners
i purchased this to connect a sennheiser e825 mike with guitar amps
great guitar but could certainly use these tuners
i also bought the green one
great for singing micing amps and such
i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding
i dislike it so much i had to edit my review
talk about a false sense of security
dont believe this is what it is meant for
thats either an annoyance or great
although the strap ends are light plastic theyve held up well
the ends are leather sewn onto the strap
update  the more i use this tuner the more i like it
ill try the dava picks again later if i feel the need
not as solid as the
thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions
absolutely no complaintsissues at all
edit 20130407  still working fine
i have found this to be true
they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in
all type of delays are sounds beatiful
mykyser capoworks on it just fine
2 put a preamp on this
this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value
not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are
i just bought a rickenbacker 4003 that came with schaller strap locks preinstalled
but this is a great stand
i am sorry i just cant dig it
easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft
not too difficult to get the hang of
its a bit easier to see the display
once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand
it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together
they have a long range and great sound fidelity
thats without the fuse software
ive been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels
15 to 20 dollars then sure
you cant go wrong here
they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables
the strap is comfortable and adjustable
this is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range
you just cant beat the speed and convenience of amazon
kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen
that being said its still a very good pedal
these are great lights for music stands
easy to use wipe on and wipe off
enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
maybe 5 times in my entire career
the two experiences are not the same
i have an alvarez yari acoustic guitar that i absolutely love
works well with every pedal i tried so far
it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style
someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment
this kit does the trick and truly was easy to use
speaking of those knobs they seem a little rickety
i would highly recommend this and give it a nobrainer 5 star rating
was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised
think its bucker size upgradable top and bottom didnt measure i like single coils
for that reason i just ordered another sn1
what you should know about this pedal
yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space
these are fairly pricey but i am very impressed with the quality
i got it for my son to toy around with
i highly recomend this guitar
this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect
came in perfect working condition
however there is one problem ive had with it
the result is an amazing clean boosting eq
they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge
it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise
for 50 im very impressed
edit  6 months later and its dead already
although this plays well i was disappointed with the workmanship
so these are heavy strings that work well
i used a rubber washer i had and that worked very well
sounds great for my telecaster and my stratocaster guitars
it feels well constructed like it wont break if i drop it
my guitar is absolutely beautiful
i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars
so the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight grayblack
i just got these in and i have to say very disappointed
another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site
not that i hated them just didnt really love them
good buy for the cost
its good for a laugh
this is not a lightweight stand
gls makes a great product for musicians on a budget
installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster
it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read
4 for these 12 beautiful premium quality picks is a steal
if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise
this is the first and only tc electronic product ive ever purchased
i had it shipped off and back in 7 days
i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting
its comfortable and fits my bass well
i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the gs specs
i own a few tuners including a boss tu70
the package instructions are correct but not very helpful
the picture does not do it justice
great tuner just bought 8 of them for xmas presents
i checked in my case
however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate
is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point
1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack
when set on blink they blink way too fast
i am very satisfied with my purchase
great idea though and the price is right at 25 street
its just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals
there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time
the tailpiece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing
this little tuner is sweet
the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose
furthermore they are very accurate as well
great all around mic used for vocals
i can honestly tell a difference
i recommend the 7000 model
where i really noticed the difference was in recording
i personally guarantee your satisfaction
this will allow me to show off and protect them
thank goodness pickup prices are coming down
i wouldnt buy anything else
very happy with it considering the price point
they continue to work to this day
this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there
this is a great winder
great feel to them and nice sounding
can be upgraded in time if you choose
the top portion that rests on a table surface is about 14 inch think
ehso for the pricehighly recommended
this should be your first pedal
this fender cable is the perfect length for me
its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit
then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and youre ready to go
the cases you get now could be made by a different company
i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy
easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass
they are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers
the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock
these picks sound good and have lasted well
this fender tuner is a great alternative
i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup
this little dude does a great job
great for around the house and rehearsal
i do not use a dramatic effect more or an evh setting for leads
this is great idea to clean guitar strings
either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point
and it works very nicely with the dunlop dual design straplok system
great guitar strings and affordable
recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt1 clip on tuner
just not my cup of tone thats all
lifetime warranty and you wont be replacing it any time soon
it really makes my solos rip
lolwould allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice
i have been using dadario strings for 30 years
you cant miss with this product
so my baby boom does the trick
i couldnt be happier with the purchase
it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down
for my limited purposes this works great
some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho
the padding is comfortable but slightly heavy velcro flaps make installation easy
this is everything you need in a record brush
first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express
one must grant its largely a matter of personal taste and expectation
if you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star
could i play faster with them
thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best
the potential for damage here is very high
i am an acoustic guitar addict
the tuning pegs gears were stiff and a bit hard to turn
monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end
perfect for recording loud drums
its very lightweight and with its optional plug and onoff switch is versatile enough
this is a super easy to use pedal
i was displeased with a somewhat poorquality strap i was using before
i bought this at guitar center and now wish that i hadnt
a lot of players say you have to have a set glued neck
its pretty enough and fine for a 100 guitar
i use them with my pedal board and havent any issues with signal quality
it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around
especially when i practice monotonous scales
these are not coming off anytime soon
i decided to use light martin strings
this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm57
this guitar cable is very nice
this mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears
i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick
the simplicity of this mic is very nice
unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally
did not hold the strings down very well for me
i ended up using that pick for something like 3 years playing 12 timeswk
a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat
it has much better tone than i expected and very good action
this is a great effect
and you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hours
the metronome is pretty loud for the small size
this seems like a nice product but maybe im doing something wrong
i didnt use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs
the display is bright and easy to see in most light
these guys are rocksolid and really easy to install
good build and doesnt look cheap
if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software
this brush is sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest and thorens
the uke is a solid little guy
very pleased with the product and price
just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned
fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability
word word word word word word word word word word
it holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments
this pedal is very versatile
i highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar
these arent an expensive tuner comparatively speaking and thats good
thats a considerable investment to abandon
i say this one just may be a keeper
its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades
had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars
i can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though
rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain
if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up
this works well with the mandolin
there are also knobs for volume and tone
all in all a good value for the money
lately ive become enamored of thekala kaubassfs solid mahogany ubass  fretted
i really like the stability of the one i bought
i love this product it works great
good spring action made pretty solid
many adjustments to get just the right position
no humm so that is a plus
if not then ill update this review if i can
powers up to five 9v effects using one power supply
i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one
other than that i totally recommend this microphone
they are half the size of a regular pick
the stool is very sturdy no rocking no swaying no moving at all
i pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless
i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems
the headline says it all
i use them for playing bass
like the title says the timeless combo of neutrik  mogami is better
i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar
to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling
the screen is big and easily read
i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows
the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl 2010 multipattern studio mic
if i was really good i can see the need
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician
now im faced with working out all of my own presets
i dont often use a pick for my soprano uke
comes with a 14 inch adapter which is nice
thats what it looks like
what many people call 34bright34 brilliance is the opposite of 34dull34
i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more
as far as quality these are great
just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go
cons  a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass
a musthave for your guitarbassukulele bag
epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier
it would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons
even came with a couple of velcro straps
the title says it all
it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful
not easy to set up hard to tighten down
it will overheat the amp and start acting weird
how did you test it
now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these
sustain and harmonics are insane
as for quality it has an unconditional guarantee see above
the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my fender deluxe reverb amp
but for less than 100 nice doesnt even describe it
they are still usable as decent picks
it helps to clean the guitar
and now my personal debate continues
its easy to set up and use
small yet clean and versatile
i really like the durability and clear sound quality
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps
tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely its pretty sensitive
the display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate
so far it has lived up to my expectations
excellent rack screws with washers
theres no real benefit to these strings
these stands are great for my lesson business
this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear
fat thick smooth and saturated
fender 351 picks are some of the best picks money can buy
easy to use portable cheap
but this is a keyboard not an organ
what else can i say
ive used and own many tuners and brands
one of those duh things i didnt even think of until just now
the part that holds the music isnt as wide as other stands
cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent
dont even think of using this for music
except for that time i couldnt find it
the price is also right and i recommend
i would recommend this product
good structural integrity thus far
i love this its do fun to play with
ive never had a problem with these patch cables
very nice case for the price
at this point im not even sure that i will use them
its right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time
dont buy those other picks buy these because tortex
they are inexpensive and sound great
what can i say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal
really you hate warm sustaining naturaltube overdrive you wont like it at all
havent put a pad there or anything
it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music
i purchased a power supply to go along with it
the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long
i havent had any problems with them at all so far
the octave is a joke
i tried this at the store
this one was hard to read
i just got mine today and tried it out
this bag is made well enough
this little recorder is absolutely amazing for its size
i have used these strings for years and this was a great price
the evans pedal patch will work for you great
but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done
lunar lander here we come this pedal will take your playing to the moon
except for that 22nd fret oh well
im so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool
not much else to say about strings  p
its cheap its basic and it works
the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic
the mat protects the guitar body
its pretty accurate on that neck up to the 4th fret
a consideration  this is suede and will fuzz for the first little while
i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though
i need some less expensive equipment to play on
i always keep a lot of these on hand
i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night
the amazon price is terrific
it does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color
having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks
when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer
i always thought i was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned
arrived as expected very solid great fit
the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there
when you solo the vocals you can tell which is used
i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound
this behringer dd400 delay unit has a lot of great features
easy to install and have never failed me
a must have for any folk player
may buy another for a spare
i think its a good choise for any pedalboards
i am amazed at how good the strings feel now
it can do a lot more but its what i wanted
very pleased with this purchase
one for the electric one for the acoustic etc
but its a good pedal effect
this tuner really delivers its inexpensive and accurate  much better than the sn1
i returned the skb ps45 and got the pt2 as a replacement
the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak
this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years
the jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime
ill update this review if anything happens
the fun old rock n roll stuff
highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable
it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones
sounds just like an amp in your headphones
as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere
ive two of these stands
the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use
i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it
i see that some of the other reviewers disagree
it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend
i tend to use cleaning sprays
you wont feel so bad when one falls off the stage  breaks
this slide is very thick and works great
it works in win 7 just fine
i found running leads  scales with this pick to be a delight
my 66 had thin frets
he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar
this power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals
the shielding on these planet waves cables are great
works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money
has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too
these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables
however i like to play at a substantially high volume for recording
maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly but i dont think so
i never use it so i really only wasted my money
cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality
i figured id get my moneys worth from them regardless
its tri pack with great quality strings on good deal
it uses a normal 9v adapter jack thank you finally
it is a good fit for the soprano uke
i really wanted to like these but theyre a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin mess
a great buy worth the money
i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker
either one is not good
an excellent value highly recommended
pop one of these in
i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather
we are just playing for the love of it
it cut through really well
maybe i just got a bad one
these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips
relatively small but is a secure
suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment
at ten dollars i think its a nobrainer
still a great product though
most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot
very very good tune result
but thats not what guitars are for right
this includes taking the time to store them for use
its a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness
the arms are adjustable  stay where you put them
a great item at a great price
these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings
a  mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd  vs
no better and no worse
i have a lot of pedals
it does that my dial is set at 10 oclock
i think it really adds life to solid state amps
so grab a pack and get jamming
you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music
i have used this on my les paul
gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings
i didnt notice any difference to the feel of the string
i should have gotten the 15 foot but you live and learn
then spend your savings on something else
i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsalpractice type combos
no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min
i read the description but it did not say cheap
much better than a standard clip on a mic
controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on
easy to use and perfect size
one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself
i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars
i do mixing and voice overs so i needed the real deal
it is smaller than i thought it would be
right out of the box
slash from guns n roses uses them
with ten packs it will likely be a while before i do so
i guess i have tried about every type of pick around
ive been using this polish since the early 80s
i also have the trombone and saxclarinet stand from them
this is built like a tank and should last a lifetime
i will definitely recommend these
talking about plugged sound its no where close to unplugged
i need to order a couple more packs though
however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions
they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing
in all actuality its a really simple design
totally unusable as far as im concerned
these arent the dirtcheap  these actually have some nicer connectors  midgrade level
happy that i did however
i used this on a 5string bass
my guitarbanjos tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass
i admit it my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick
connect mics ipods mp3 players
when playing at home ill use the more gentle schubb
they turn out to be great
what more could you possibly ask for
typical behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound
there is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the onoff switch
its held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone
get it if youre a simple player with few fx in your arsenal
seems great need more time to explore what it can do
im very happy with it and will buy more as i need more
getting used to the attachment
yes i bought 3 and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass
otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb
i am glad i did the tone is great
i also have one for my bass
the pick pocket is handy
best tuneri have owned for the price
who said santa was a scrouge
they are warmer sounding well balanced
that said there is only one piezo element unlike a kk pickup for example
the case is better padded than i might have expected for the price
the product description seems to report a weight of 85 ounces
there is absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks of any kind
use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp
this strap works fine on my fender strat
glad i have it only for the purpose i intended
thats not uncommon among studio monitors
so i ordered another one
at least its cheap though
however buying behringer products always require crossing fingers and hope that they last
this capo works very well
these strings are very nice and sound great
ive had it for about six years
love the heavy cord and gold connectors
it works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen
they made my cordoba c5 sound like a more expensive guitar
but mostly they are unplayable
easy to put on the guitar
its a fair quality ultra cheap cable
rubber no skid bottom is a plus
it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room
however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot
i bought this for my sons 7th birthday
and note that unlike what you may read in another review they are adjustable
im a semipro player and this tuner is all i need
its very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer
you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those
when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened
i compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own
the instrument just doesnt have enough power to carry some types of music
these things are great and yes i can shred faster now
for the price i think its hard to get any better than this
i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak
just hit add to cart
i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul
have three of these hercules hangers
especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isnt stock boss
this is to be expected at this price
the clean tones on this are just great
second this instrument is no lightweight either in heft or playability
it only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy
this does just what it says it does
the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless
the same sound for a lot less money
this is a very comfortable strap
i have ordered 6 or 7 or these
this is a great buy
now i power all my pedals with one power supply
it actually reclines back fairly far
the red color looks nice
i tried it and the light wouldnt even come on indicating usb
i only use them and i have been playing for a decade
it also looks very nice
metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must
i like to experiment with different types of picks
i am very impressed with how nice this strap is
my expectations were frankly low
i swear by these quick release clips
after all if i ding this one up i havent broke the bank
and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time
the end connectors were well made and strong
i got exactly what i expected
its not always just the power supply making the noise
have others i trust more
so why this particular capo
no tubes means no tube issues
i use it to wind my strings
eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned
this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should
it has served its purpose and i use it nearly everyday
this is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments
awesome crunch and great sustainability
the other one was not bad i lasted probably 10 years
the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer
they stand out too much
this is a great quality microphone and at a good price
i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb
the rubber wont hurt your violin bridge or strings
ive been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years
for 20 this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation
these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work
also worked great on my 6 strings
i tried ernie ball slinkys just for shiggles
perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties
note  the music stand easily detaches from the adjustableangle part for storage
in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect
compact design on stand and folding for travel
ive played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos
guitar pics what more can i say
granted this was caused by me dropping it once but before it was fine
one is the stock reverb
fits any guitar banjo or even a cello
but those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself
i have used roland and fender amps and pas
that sort of irked me
stravinsky violin concerto  anne sophie mutter from mutter modern
works very well in this capacity
not all gold hardware is the same color gold
but i was getting pissed because the ernies kept corroding so quickly
you need to do that with the speaker switch
i kept it because to be honest it is very cheap
with the mute it dropped to 6db
proper vibrato comes from the fingers
my fingers were squeeking  sticking on the strings  back of neck bad
in fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days
it is a highquality gig bag with lots of padding
just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise
thus i give it 3 stars
we found nothing negative that we could say about it
the intonation issues are greatly reduced and i am thrilled
if you like muffs youll really like this one
in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact
the high midscoop mode is calling your name
best mic in this price range by far
it will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the master
no cheap way is there
it also has that vintage fender coolness factor
guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string
one reviewer wrote that it is a very lowlow
this tuner is tiny and accurate
its not a metal type distortion but it nicely covers everything else
ii do replace it for guitar cable work fine im happy with this unit
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects
good investment for the price
my favorite strings for 30 years
the finish on this product is very nice
or if you like both equally
if i needed another i would buy this type
the finish on it is outstanding and id like to keep it that way
it isnt a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb les paul
everything should be this easy to use and work this well
i bought this as for practice
my pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now
the newest pair live in my gym bag
since i bought these i have been using the heavy thickness ones
i recommend you get this
not the same as a mxr so dont get your hopes up on that
the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase
you cant go wrong with these
my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit
great little mixing console for home use and practice
a very nice pick both in feel and texture
have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar
it runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9volt power supply
i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones
they look good and the paint lasts great for a performance space
there are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well
not too big or not too small
luckily i keep that on hand
its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy
i like the speaker on this amp
theres nothing better than these strings
been using it for a month or 2 now
first the bass e 11th string broke while tuning it up
i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones
works as designed on my acoustic
i use it as a practice mic
its just a perfect standard wah
the body is very solid beautiful finish mine is a sunburst color
two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up
we got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar
you will not regret it
otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference and it should
no other distortion pedal can do it as well
i ordered this for my husband the musician
im surprised i havent broken it yet
easy to assemble and feels solid
this is a good thing  its sensitive
but is a well made product if you use it for what its for
it never sounds 34thumpy34 or unnatural  but always musical
my transmitter pack slid on with ease and i was ready to go
also the case is nice
i really cannot recommend this bag enough
makes a perfect small studio combination
but this is the switch for that amp
kudos to amazon for posting this warning
turn it on clip it on and tune
the c harp was terrible
so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts
amazingly it is made in canada not china
item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging
it wont break the bank and it wont break your back
and i saved about 70 or 80 bucks
i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance
a tricky process at best
didnt have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size
i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin
and im the better for it
they are small which takes getting used to though
i like the sound of the wound third
ive owned just about every muff
the light is twolevel  normal and bright
i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter
i bought this for my taylor 714
3 the interface is clean an easy to use
it also seems to be very accurate
only problem is the clip on install to the strap
you know if you do guitar work you need a neck stand
i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness
its no gibson but it is a lp
its not bulky which is a nice
i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model
i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends
no i do not work for tascam
item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set
its perfect for my samson mic
you cant go wrong with the ts808
amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too
it is similar to this one
this is a nice cable
elixir polywebs were the first coated string
im used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly
actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar
in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient
the fulltone full drive 2 is another incarnation of the original fulldrive
they clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced
the sound is also really good its very resonant and just sounds 34good34
bottom line this is a nobrainer
it has a green led and large mark for being on target
paid less than half through amazoncomgreat product that works very well with nitro finishes
the guitar just stays in tune now period
same setup same hardware etc and one person can have wildly differing results
and also for the money a great deal
i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself
it runs on electric so no need for batteries
does its job just fine
the description on amazon fits the c1u not the c1
im a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables
and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul
listen to the voice of experience grrr
this stand is very stable and useful
it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box
the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite
i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house
further more do i stick with the same brand
after im done the shine looks glassy and great
this stand holds up my ukulele so yay
4 the case is made of metal
for me great studiorecording use but thats it
it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument
the xls are comparable in gauge to ernie ball regular slinky yellow
they are very good strings worth the cost
i didnt notice any change in tone
the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff
i have switched to daddarios to capture that frusciante sound
for 2500 it a pretty useful pedal
try the light if you are a beginner
however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar
decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar
unfortunately i think the roadrunner is better quality thicker material
the best xlr cables you can find
got them in 3 days and love them
why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio
this is exactly what i was hoping for
id suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand
i would buy these again
i know theyre incredibly durable as are all boss pedals
plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup
i havent noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about with these cables
also bought the 25 length and used them on an assignment recently
grips really well in your hand plays like a dream
this is an amazing guitar
i really dont know what else to say about them
5 starts totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal
this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice
i finally got the best out of that set of strings
would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set
you cant necessarily go wrong with knobs
the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard
add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus
what more can i say
simply search  for guitar stands on here and see for yourself
hosa makes good stuff this is no exception
very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find
highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar
i heard about these from a friend several years back
the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished
this is such a sturdy board
i rocked all night and loved the sound
first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid
and it looks very professional
overall its a solid cable for practice
it is the sound that i like though
this the second set of strap locks that ive owned
they stand out because everyone loves the idea of them
with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar
great price sturdily built great compressor effect
solid and super easy to use
brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking
some items of gls work great others are awful
if your budget is below that dont bother and save more
as far as the sn8 is concerned
there isnt much about it that would give away its price
picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology
solid construction and the mounting just works
but im sure something better will appear next year and until then
i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money
i thought it wouldve lasted a little longer
this capo design works best for me
well you get the picture
i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature
i know that is just insane
but the main this is that it worked
but my aggravations are really small ones
extremely versatile and as is typical with all boss pedals absolutely sturdy
its inexpensive and does what its supposed to
i needed a cheap good quality mic and this fit the bill
it had been a while since i had some ebs
i like them very much
beside having a great range of audio pickup the mic is so versatile
the bars are easy to see and are accurate
but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy
this is definitely more accurate than a persons ear while other instruments are playing
you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often
it pretty much takes over your entire sound system
huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar
so far now they sound great feel great
very little instructions at all actually
it recognized the devices presence but it didnt produce any sound on the computer
been giggin since the early 70s and have been hosting an openmic to boot
to my ears the rest were less distinctive
it accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer
hes absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner
these sound good by that i mean they dont have any sound at all
good value and good function
if you get stuck using batteries plan on 34 hours worth of use
awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere
mesa minirectifier amplifier mesa rectifier 2x12 cabinet with celestion v30s
this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more
i think they are worth the premium price
yep i said it better than a tubescreamer
this was a filler item for a much larger order
the price is right and the size is right
i dont hate any of them
also the 34feet34 dont spread as wide apart as id hoped
they arrived on time and i will order them again
it has less granularity in the display for example
these are my goto acoustic strings
secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick
this case was not intended for the emperor ii
this audio interface is fantastic
great at eliminating feedback in a live setting
sturdy welldesigned and frets the strings well
if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy
it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly
this tuner is spot on every time and super fast
these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys
this little guy worked just as advertised
just a push on the pedal and im switching noiselessly between guitars
this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar
guitar tuned easy and holds tune well
they are simply the best there is for a fair price
then i found this and decided to get it
if you buy you wont be disappointed
heres a link to the extendo optionlevys leathers mmgxl25brn strap extender http www
its also very good looking
it works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror
now i cannot live without it
the tool works great and is sturdy
where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords
need a little variety in your life
its clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife
this review was for the old models
i had never used strap locks before and dont think i will again
got what i needed  a basic capo for a good price
love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks
i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some
these and reds are my favorite acoustic strings
what you need to know about this mic 1 this mic is very directional
i still tried it with a difference mic
new tuners like the snark sn8b are a joy in comparison
and so far i havent lost any yay
i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets
some case manufacturers have the same problem
it is plastic but it suits my needs
silent tuning so on stage its almost a must
bought this amp probably about two years ago
everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem
that counts for the gig bag too
but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box
ive had it for almost 3 years now
much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries
i have a gibson les paul that i bought used
it doesnt color or diminish your tone in any way
this was was better then i expected
i am so glad i did
planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff
ive mounted my samson q1u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it
you can mess around swapping parts pickups and capacitors
it didnt work very well but it is what was available to me
behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why
oh ya the grip is perfect
this is a fantastic little recorder but not for 300
go ahead and get them  youll be glad you did
this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini
great stand durable folds down nicely and really does the job
the h2 unlike my pricey sony can handle both
in fact it may be overkill
i havent tested it for recording purposes
it just didnt provide any plus at all anywhere else
the little knob on them made it very hard to install
you can plug it into the pc and customize everything
when used with a pedalboard rig it doesnt add much except for hiss unfortunately
i went a long time convincing myself that i didnt need these
im not unhappy though this stand works quite well
to me this makes it much easier when changing strings
it just holds a guitar
all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase
decent stand as long as you arent abusing it
she has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome
the strings came very quickly and are of very good quality
i find myself wishing i had ordered more
these picks are the bomb
the pick holder work as described
i prefer woven cables for looks
seller is a in my book
i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it
so  online to see what defined state of the art
these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break
i still like the pt2 much better
they last a long time if you wipe down after use
this model is a keeper to be sure
i choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me
i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion
i bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall
but the reviews were telling a different story
have been for the last 30 years
these rubber picks metal picks etc
as far as the sn8 is concerned
i use the cm2 if i want to play dirtier and for covers
everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion
i am an older person who has old eyes
if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise
ive been using d addario strings for 20 years to great satisfaction
like this camo capos simplicity and its unique color
i am 66 years old and have been playing guitar for over fifty years
get hot to wear in the summer
this is a nice strap
however ive purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less
and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface
for your money i cant recommend the eq enough
probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately
the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works
i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less
that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words
since its based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise
the entire material and holding surface is the same material
i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand
to use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks
im going to be honest i have a cheap guitar
probably wont be a daily driver but interesting none the less
pedal is not working it just making noise
last forever and easy to hold onto
if you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you
item received looks diferent i say better
for the money i figured why not
despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc
rhythm and lead styles both sound great
and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound
not much i can say about a standard mic stand
the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing
even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing
we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one
the fender logo makes it look legit
for the price its a bargain
excellent build and looks great
good luck if you buy it
ive seen and used some better cables but not at this price point
quality german manufacturing as always
i though it would be like the pianos sustainer
no big deal as it wipes right off
your strings will thank you
seems to take a few bangs without problems
the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too
i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents
this was a good purchase
i would give 5 stars but the manufacturer should provide more information
i lost my trusty slide and really miss it
they are large and  well  plastic
this may be 10watts but it can fill a big room with its sound
oh how life changes with a baby
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys
10 picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company
retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied
id definitely recommend them to anyone who doesnt like tying on their guitar straps
as expected for a beginner
not really worth the 75  i returned mine
best articulate bass string for the money
too long is better than too short
its a great buy in my opinion
one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair
i have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings
the colors are nice as well
i bought this to work with my 9 year old son
these ultex are much better
i bought this becausehey a wireless mic for 13
i couldnt have hoped for more from these stands
really nice upgrade for your standard tuners
the strings didnt sound betteer or brighter
if you are a satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining
the good news is you do not need to buy converters for them
youll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc
i use it with my samson cl8 condenser and it is perfect
seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so
always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases
and it also cuts the strings
i am very pleased with the product
simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings
would buy it again if stolen as they say
ive read its not really complete isolated but it does the job
outlet 6 is a 12v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power
this is subtle yet effective
the pick guard looks a bit cheap but thats just nitpicking
after rebooting the computer the problem went away
i have two of these
its a brilliant idea haha
but im having fun and trying
i have many microphones and this compares to the 50
i have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base
the similarlypriced fender is a fpos
guessing they are lacking some shielding
this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build
easy to do and youll notice an immediate increase in distortion
a great sound in audio recording
as far as durability goes they are the reigning champs
there is a metronome function which i havent used
its smooth to use and the sound is superb
light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar
the pockets are very handy
it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers
put these on my prs se 245 and i love em
gb e were all flat on the fret side
works well for a multitool
recommend to someone need replace cable jct
i dont get any hum and it powers what i need it to
in my opinion this is the best guitar volume pedal available
i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also
you can set the height always considering that your guitars dont reach the floor
it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing
easy to pack easy on the instrument light weight but sturdy
all and all for the price its a 5 star
i wish i would have thought of these
installed these on my schecter c1 hellraiser
i like this speaker system behringer makes good products when it comes to this
great to have when friends come over to jam
this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools
maybe it is built better
i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables
its adjustable with a pick pocket simple good quality would by another
but its a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter
this really does shine up your wood quite well
this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though
it looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar
so  build quality excellent
not the greatest but ok
that alone can cause problems
daddario strings have never failed me
fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers
several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning
this was a bit unexpected because of the bright label on the package
the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish
when i plugged into the hot tubes i was surprised but immediately intrigued
this set is not for everyone
very handy to have two picks with you at all times
but these pitch blacks are not bad
had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened
maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me
there isnt any and it does not color your tone one bit
really like the eq on the main output
pretty deluxe strings for the price here on amazon
i like thin picks myself and this one is very thin
always spot on with the frequency
might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying
line 6 offers tons of sounds
they have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound
so choose whichever color you prefer and go for it
the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well
i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display
its not the ole clip it and go capo im used to
it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads
the capo also has a handy builtin pick holder
i have used the line 6 looper in the past line 6 jm4 looper
what can i say this pedal has never left my pedalboard
i used it live and they are really great durable and it feels pro
it sucks at that too
it was a total waste of money but doesnt pay to return it
also comes with a step by stepstage by stage instruction pamphlet
it seems to be very durable as well
what you see is what you get
removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort
but you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you
no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings
based on other reviews i made my purchase
how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me
works with downloadable xedit software
this is a great item
when not in use it just gets put away
the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy
does what you want and need and looks great
this stuff will lube up your strings pretty well
also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models
for the money there isnt a better tuner on the market today
lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body
this bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price
its not gucci but doesnt feel like plastic either
i started using these a few years ago
quality product at a good price
i use this as my 34clean34 sound without the overdrive
i got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars
tried as i might i could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of
slim and easy to install though longer than the qk10b
ghs strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these
it is built very well with long lasting parts
i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands
if you want sm58s you need to buy sm58s
i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo
it is a good piece and a good deal
no more issues with ground loops or other problems
the concept is great but the execution of it sucks
on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy
very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue
it was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it
using it on an acoustic dreadnought and its plenty long enough
conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically
im used to a higher quality from eb products
this was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions
i cant really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings
holds my picks in place  nicely
other than that this was a great investment
is compact once its folded up
this was very easy to put together
dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasnt installed
the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric
made in china it says
i guess this is typical for distortion boxes
also i believe the very best value for the dollar
i own a total of five uca202s that i use in different locations
if it lies flat then so is the fingerboard
compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss
although the others have more features i like this little pedal
i am very happy with it
it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics
my only minor gripe is that it is springloaded to open
i like its texture and the size
its a relatively short delay which is great for many genres
it is small and doesnt look like a huge lump on the headstock
but they do the job just fine
fast accurate and a joy to use
and i got a kyser 6string capo in gold and that works well
nice case but doesnt provide the protection that i need for my guitars
for me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz
it gets the job done but it has a few flaws
but i had serious questions about the classic rock amplug
i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball 4037 black polypro strapinstead
my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it
on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for 360 to 380
im a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me
i believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds
affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingcons  this model is one compartment
theyre very thin nylon picks
theyre better in a thicker size 10mm or larger but the
it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for
i admit i havent had it long but so far so good
i just ordered another set for my strat hss
im not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices
this is the best mic for its quality and its price
it is more than i hoped for
but they last a long time and sound great
for the price i would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one
highly recommend the classic rock  5 stars
stick tape holds it anywhere you want it
now i dont know why
unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat
i have found that this model fits my needs perfectly
i love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing
i have several guitars and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar
not that i ever use it
i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out
it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp
but for me they are still tops
id read some good reviews and 2000 isnt much money
it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive
the capo is pretty good
i love the neck and the back
only negative is i dont know how long it will hold up
the clarity is superb and the bass is awesome
the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position
and they all are super
cons tuners may or may not slip when playing hard
i have had no problems with them at all
its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage
this is not a toy
i like it so much that i ordered three more
this is a hard shell tolex covered case
not much you can say about these theyre knobs
im a basement rockstar  the mustang gets it done without any problems
this tuner is easy to use
dont expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though
they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time
try it and i think youll like it
honestly i cant tell them apart since i threw out the boxes
the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar
there wasnt a 150 difference
that is supposed to last longer than average strings
i received it and the first thing i did is try it
i hate them as a rule
i used that korg until getting the snark
for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product
it was in two words masterfully made
really tight because its brand new but its really sturdy and solid
ive picked up a few of these for my various guitars
the first is that the finish is not as good
the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit
they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus
a strap is a strap what can you really say about it
ok so i just installed these things for my krk 6s no stands
i saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets
well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio
ive tried eh nano grail
trustable quiet good materials durable etc
i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine
this was not thought out very well
for the price 30 shipped it cant be beat
i mean my computer is really stripped down
i like them and glad i purchased them  so far
ive been buying cheap stands and im never really getting what i want
he loved the variety  number of picks
great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal
we got a good deal too
this pedal has an extremely high output
sweet strap nice colors good quality
my first one arrived not working at all
the power jack however leaves a little to be desired
whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it
i have it custom mapped for multiple softwares
i really like planet waves products
the switch on that one isnt as good as the behringers
love amazon why shop anywhere else
it is doing exactly what i expected and much more
i bought this amp for my 7 year old son
i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean
would also be ok with guitars
its very stable and in tune all time while playing
im completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it
the arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching
still have it and love it
you will be far far happier
guitar picks make a huge part of your tone
just remember use some common sense dont expect the guitar to totally stable
who knows maybe theyll wear in and improve
they were tinny and clangy sounding
they ring so bright and beautiful
not a huge deal but a consideration
there is also one available that looks like a guitar
sounds good and has great intonation
otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger
i just cant believe how loud this little baby is
i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems
after testing a set i have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars
no seriously are you buying it
it has both gain and volume output controls and both work
its the tube screamer of delay pedals
but i hope then would run on batteries next time
ive used more than a handful of usbfirewire interfaces over the past decade
when this arrived i didnt realize it was that small
this one is an ivoryish color and it is really nice
the 3 modes are nice
they stay in your fingers well
its a fingerprint magnet but thats about the only gripe i have
its not cheap and flimsy though
i bought a case of these
i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon
it mutes the violin to a reasonable level
mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue
it has one small pit in the red finish
update 4413  added back a star
i believe some people call it 34pixie dust34
but its a nice cable
i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment
i wish it had at least one more inch
amazoncom did a great job too getting this out to me
the action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up
overall great deal for the price
try finding a midi tutorial that is usable
overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be
i was not disappointed at all
my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect
works as advertised for polishing my guitars
at this price its kinda like the amp itself  a no brainer
it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch
personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal
they work great every time
i will be buying more of these
fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet
here are my itemized observations  first three sets for 13 currently
this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion
turning the odrive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle
they have a very comfortable feel and great sound
its one more tool to make set up less stressful
bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer
a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar
i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze
other than that its fine and pretty well constructed
i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy
danny gatton did so and i wouldnt have it any other way
this is such a nice bag for the price
the truth is they will work on anything
seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it
good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano
the plastic shaft feels like it will break
this one is easy  buy it
a nice extra piece of flexibility
elixir is a wonderful company
it does the job well
this thing has so many uses its ridiculous
great sound from this bad boy
doesnt have the same feel either
would i buy this yes if i didnt try anything else first
they really are the better string
leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is
but not enough to keep it
at least not with the mic boom there
it was way too short for my seagull s12 coastline
definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
basically it is much more to the point
that being said they also dont cost 70
by now they work really good and no interference where detected
so i am very happy with them
world has gone bass crazy since about 1981
we tried it a number of ways and nothing worked
sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or halfstep higher
clamp it on and play
lets have a go  im glad i did
sounds identical to my shure sm58 but much less
one of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage
i have only used it with garage band but it works really well
i usually use 9s but decided to try these 10s instead
good tone and they stay in tune
they do what theyre supposed to do
the only con i could give is if they go bad
so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input
i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone
ordered this and two cables
i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard
i use ctype snapon strap locks but they will no longer fit
for the price this is a wonderful strap
it is pretty good quality and durable too
fit finish feel and action were all very nice
lots of good presets and capabilities
i think it would wear quickly with lots of use
i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews
outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time
remember  because of the material you will notice a slight difference in sound
behringer makes great products at incomparable prices
this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle
20 seconds really isnt much
my first elec guitar im 60 years old and this guitar is perfect
i bought this along with a clayton large glass slide
youll probably have to break them
i can say that the brands8217 reputation carries over to bass8212these are phenomenal strings
adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar
you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc
it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward
supports a lot of weight
i knew i had found 34my strings34 after a short time playing with these
it is fully adjustable allowing for all body types
i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this
this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course
once they did communicate they were very unprofessional
i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface
i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases
the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible
the voice knob is hard to describe
moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise
designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job
love love love the hastlefree access to my picks
i requested this for christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it
otherwise dont have an adjustable tilt option
this works very good on a silver flute
you have to do it from the software
have used them for months with no failures
typical plastic durable and looks good
it does what it says
the 12pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity
other than that quite useful and durable
of course that is 54 solid inches of stage front though
of course i just got it
this product is something every guitar owner needs
think about what youre used to
what the hell was behringer thinking
they would look great on a either a strat or tele
i wish i had went in a different direction
this capo does exactly what it should
as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy
it comes with 2 aaa batteries
i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews
the balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems
terrific for gigs or practice a back up or just beginning guitar
the pics also shed easily making your instrument dusty in no time
i own three shubbs a kyser a dunlop and one of those rolling capos
so i found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine
weak sounding and break very easily
well father than it looks like it would in the pics
pickups far less than inspiring
it works on my pinky finger
my les paul is heavy
fast delivery and a good price
now im stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings
every musician should have one of these around
it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play
ive tried them all and i like the shubb the best
my acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments
getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended
im sorry martin but i like the elixers the best
i think thats the way it really sounds
my reviews for this have changed a few times but no more
i want a refund plus an hourly wage
the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple
not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand
in that case i would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier
im very happy with this stand
2012 were all 5star reviews
this is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich
they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently
this set is no exception
however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
when i received the strap i realized it doesnt fit a banjo
good quality cable with a good price
for me they were a waste of money
010s in stock as well as over a dozen
phantom power and data transfer has been flawless
so i suggest you to use the power adapter
i like to hit things
and have for 40 years
sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a
then theres the biggest problem
these martin strings m170 arent bad
i have this paired with the behringer c1 studio condenser microphone
put this on a gibson j45
i was able to get great marshall like tone out of it quite easily
this works better than the qk10b model by the same company
still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone
i think what happened is i just left it on too long
the metronome will drive you crazy
i would recommend this product
or use a nicer external power supply  the first thing id upgrade
the plastic is thick and of a nice material
it does some compression overdrive eqing notch eqing and exciteing all in one pedal
i should have had more faith in fender
its obviously simple to use having one knob and all
plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands
the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges
regarding the item itself i am bit lukewarm
for what i paid i wont bother returning them
otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it
under 10 wouldve been better
perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes
im a beginner and can change my own strings so im proud of myself
bag was ripped so i almost lost the screw and washer
my amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style
i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars
otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups
the unit is very heavy and rugged
on the other three joyo sound pedals the opposite is true
reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some
the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments
i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes
overall im happy with my choice
either they kind of 34disappear34 when youre playing or they feel like a hindrance
my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap
maybe i can put a few potted plants on it
since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice
shipping took far too long
i have 2 70w 1234 amps and a big fender dsp 212
i am a user of behringer products though own 2 of their amps
the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus
its easy to uphook one and hook the other
i installed this saddle in my silvertone sd10
i bought the snark sn6 uku tuner
i record to daw and the recordings sound fine
it tends to go distortion to the point of garble
i took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared
there is one concern you may have
i highly recommend planet waves cables
luckily i order two packs
it works different than an eq
it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it
i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time
well expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan
the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabes
i am a future m audio customer from here on
they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool
its not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing
the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks
well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water
but 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck
i didnt need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
they may seem pricey for picks but theyre still not that expensive
just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord
im quite please with the xenyx 1202
the metal musthave will be in the family a while i can tell
okay mine has just arrived
theres not enough throughput in usb 11
i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day
im using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation
this is a good product
then switch to aquilas for playing
it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap
i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal
the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it
the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money
the second issue is actually a very concerning to me
never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp
a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up
what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string
fender is basically giving these things away
they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great
just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag
if oxidationwear is an issue switchcraft makes goldplated jacks
i was expecting something a little bigger
i put one in each of my guitar bagscant live without it
the price was right so i got one
great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great
this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode
it plays beautifully with my 100w amp
i decided to trythe dunlop formula 65 polish  cleaner
strings  the ones that came on there sounded great
it functions but doesnt sound great
check one out and youll want it
i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solidbody bass
i have a tech 21 bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs
i bought this to 34daisychain34 two small kustom powered pa cabinets
fold it up to take with me when i go out of town
its worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these
i own and use them both
as i said this isnt a knock of these strings
unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish
i got this at an awesome price too
the pegs line up so they drop right in
i bought this used off a friend when i got my first electric
its finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head
it works and i feel comfortable with it supporting my axe
it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place
if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my 1
meanwhile im going to buy another sturdier gig bag
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at2020 yes
strong spring that good start
hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes
it is alder and hefty but durable
has all the adapters i needed
you can use it in a number of different ways
if you try them just make sure to give them time
second elixir phospher bronze last was daddario
you can spend more but this does what you need it to do
light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped
great sound quality meets full expectations
however this product is wonderful
i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami
it cannot be denied that the boss dd7 is a versatile effective product
even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over
works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar
wow these cables are made really sturdy
the tone range is generous from mellow to high treble
got it a while back but have just started to explore its capabilities
as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio
they are all better than the line6 every one of them
hundreds of sounds to choose from
item shipped earlier than ive expected
its the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument
it has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesnt
but it was always awkward
but thats not a problem any more either
it is holding a shure sm57 microphone
ill be buying another one of these
so i had no bass control
in those 7 years i havent broke a single string
in my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass
and its heavy and not stylish in my opinion
you can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks
if youre on the fence about this pickup go for it
and the fender frontman  not even in the ballpark
this is a fun pick
the colors and designs are pretty
but hey they work so why change them
i wanted to test for myself
its so darn simple to use
these strings are what i needed and they perform
dont see how they even afford to make these things for this price
i will need to look for something else
works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar
cant argue with that track record
nice strap for the price
its such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends
i actually had to send the first one back because it did not work
very versatile and built in boost feature is great too
these super light flexible nylon picks are great if youre trying to play quietly
works great for that and for uke
switching to these 10s made a huge difference in tone
there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases
plus the price is right
i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah
enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslytotally worth the buy
easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches
granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors
its been a little over 2 years and ive used it ever since
the stereo out is very cool for using two amps
all 12 were in there all of them fender mediums
this is not a bad way to get started playing with that
the new driver actually works
i bought it during the black friday sale
i cant imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself
anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool
othewise i would still be thinking about this one
best 12string capo i have ever usedand thats over decades
i do not know anything about guitar
should come in different sizes
that might thow a few folks off but its a little thing really
some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting
this is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface
but you dont have to take my word for it
for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand
they make a strong connection between pedals and dont sacrifice any sound quality
plus i mean come on john mother  frusciante uses them
this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter
i play every day and gig one or two nights
i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound
it really put yout guitar in tune
martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar
perfect pedal it sounds great no matter what your levels are
youtube these theres loads of videos
they sound great and last forever
there are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the windows handles sound
the boss dd7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone
that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book
and indeed it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching
sooo i figured why not have a go at it
the design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid
60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick
so i am not a newbie to playing or working on guitars
wish it came in a darker grain of wood
comes with a db limiter 16dbswitch right on the mic
not happy with the sellers description or the product
it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up
i bought this strap for my taylor guitar
i feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks
i love these patch cables
update  the software works well  is very useful
ive used these on the reg for a year
you open up the back of the pedal  choose you own setting
it it isnt broke dont fix it
its a well build daisy chain dc power cable
im currently using the snark on my guitar
guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on
i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more
pretty standard vs all other straps
it has a deep tone and good volume
they have good signal though and dont seem to alter the tone
what we have here is an xlr male to xlr female black cable
your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings
not much else to say about it
we messed with the pa and all the electronics
i bought this to go with my super champ x2 combo
i would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical
got to me in two days
let me start by saying that i never even opened these
you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides
i will continue to use it
i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue
young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price
ordered a few of these
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them
in a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold
do you have a hercules guitar stand
however i have a few gripes with the 2i2
will be updating when i get the vintage 12ax7 tube replacement
great replacement and a definite upgrade
it has tuned them all very well
i would definitely buy again
against a spyder iv individual tastes will vary
fret work is top notch
fender tends to make good products
very good deal for newbies like me
012s ive been using which i think i liked a lot better
i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro
with this said over time there is a possibility of wear
after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great
they just arent quite my cup of tea
give these a try and let me know what you think
wide overdrive and tone range
the applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified
right so look for accesories and cablescords
when they break i change em
getting the recorded signal onto a computers harddrive is expedited with the included usb
my first 2 units have a very bright blue ish color led for power
i have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus
usually longer ones are only obtainable
these strings have great tone and feel
i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them
does not get me excited
this one is perfect in size and price
daddarios are the best and i love the ball end color coding
bright easy to read display
i take care of my stuff
ive never had a problem
with some acquired technique this tool does a job
i could immediatly tell the difference in both feel  sound
i usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session
all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in
yes the housing is made of plastic
i completely agree with that
however the rocktron zombie doesnt sound good through solid state amps
i have to say that i am fairy impressed
i own several tube amp combo and halfstack
all i wanted was a simple tuner
sounds simple but youll see
oo if you have a burkes outlet near you
i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut
anyway the bottom line is that daddario phosphor bronze are my go to string
had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented
in this case i still got more than my moneys worth
you cant go wrong with behringer pedals
i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received
onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things
this portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone
the most important part of video is the audio
all in all it was a good upgrade and id do it again
music 123 is a musicians friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars
these are a littl ehard to play
i like the choruslike mod button
theyre like most other brands medium
pretty precise meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy
guess ill have to stop eating cheetos while im playing  just kidding
i use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great
so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything
the extra light is easier on the fingers  but they sound thinner too
im using this as a di box for recording
this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended
but this product was a waste to me
the neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing
there are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers
i have been using dunlop picks for a long time
ive been playing for about 15 years and have always used a humidifier
i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp
plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol
tried them on a gibson j50 and they seem to do good
now it sits in my drawer and collects dust
i use this for my home recording studio
lack of any impact resistance  the bag has no padding at all
i bought a power supply never looked back
three things for the benefit of other newbs  1
i would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user
sound quality crisp mid and high range
i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58
fantastic pedal especially considering the price
im starting to lean towards the tortex
for what this does you cant go wrong for the price
seems to be sturdy and well built
note   this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack
this feature alone makes it a musthave for taking full advantage of the amp
it isnt top of the line but it gets the job done
the extra adapters are a nice touch
i been playing guitar for 12 years now
they shipped quickly and didnt break the bank
unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the 5th star
so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly
ive compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and its dead accurate
all 12 picks were there
for the price these pedals are outstanding
as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home
it worked great then one night again i couldnt hear myself recording
this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b3 type of organ sound
ive been recording professionally for 27 years music radio commercials and television mostly
once it does its beautiful music after that
the textured grip surface is great
excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage
you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw
i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download
great stuff to have for a great price8230i like it
the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad
every guitarist needs a good tuner
you may be careful around it but its hard to say for others nearby
but i always wanted an original cry baby
windows 7 install worked fine
no problems with slipping and tuning
also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use
nice inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem
this is a super solid price too
its nuts being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic
the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing
but if you sleep on the left youre gonna have a bad time
the martin m140 strings are good strings
ill probably have to breakdown and pay 100 for a real strap
does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply
they work well after adjusting them to fit
it feels reliable and without adding noise
i have 4 on hand
no fancy expensive flashy grip features
it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface
it is better than samsons inexpensive gomic which i also have
these are not only the best in delivering tone but theyre durable
it takes care of business just fine
im a daddario man myself but hey free is free
nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your back
i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not
i have always used tortex picks
what i expecteda more dead sound than the noncoated strings they replaced
i cant brag on them enough
works fine on some guitars
or are you know how to use capo
id give them 35 stars if i could
this little amp has a belt clip
its very soft and padded as well as anti static
8 opened garageband got  no input message
this is a great invention
its extremely wellbuilt and performs its task very well
the mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16000 hz
great little amp to mess around with
it just sounds heavier tighter and more articulate
5 stars for what they are
ive used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments
the double stick tape that came on it has worked well
just thought i let you know about that one
dont trust the products anymore
it is usable for applications like speaking
they are very smooth and warm and magical like a mythical unicorn
these are the only strings i use on my acousticelectric
i wouldnt put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed
we all know its just a container with a sponge in it no biggie
they project without sounding harsh or tinny
i didnt have one at all and this workgs great
the soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish
prompt shipping great price great product
foot switches are easy to use
one user even claimed epiphone should sue him
they provide enough surface area that they wont slip easily from between your fingers
manufacture said its for practice to me it serves the purpose
i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end
so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that
definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future
sound great play great keeping their tune
got these because i wanted some extra capos around
they work and are fender parts
the strap locks do work
costs a little extra but well worth that price
the accuracy in my opinion just isnt there
its also not the same size as the one in the photo much wider
ive tried other passive volume pedals that didnt work
he lost it after performing in a play on stage
also the clamp works well
runs a little bit on the hot side
i opted to purchase the newer model korg tm50pw instrument tuner and metronome
if youre looking for an economical strap this will work great
fenders at least americanmade ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these
comes with a velvet pouch and dvd
this cable arrived today and i am still in shock
i like the ability to customize tension
only with your guitar volume knob
i was surprised because outwardly the string didnt look that bad
the cable shipped fast and i couldnt be more pleased
either way it works well
power is about 46 hours of continuous recording
tripod base to get over stage cables and a boom arm with clips
no problem very standard one
i got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect
you want it come get it
other than that ive had no problems
dont expect it to break anytime soon anyway
the old amps we had were way too big
im sorry but thats just idiocy in action
wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass
these cables are just poorly thought out
i plan on using them as backups in the studio
works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten
when youre satisfied just hold again to enter regular onoff mode
this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price
good feel grip and not too heavy or thick
it has cushin padding so my guitar is safe  its small but stady
this is a very useful product at a fair price
the classic vibe 60s strat really impresses me through this amp
i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks
i still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner
got here in 2 days
i have owned almost every octaveharmonizerpitch shifter on the market
musicians gear tubular guitar stand black pair is a good deal for musician
500k pots and side body 14 trplug keeps the cable out of the way
absolutely a 5 star value
sure its a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it
i bought this specifically for a gt100
havent had this long but so far its just about perfect
i will update if any problems arise in time
they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock
the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light
makes rotosound strings really sound off
second is holding its own
that comes with a solid extension arm
and you will need a longer usb cord
love the security of having my picks within grasp
i bought this for quality ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live
purchased a pack for my playing buddy
its light sensitive and looks professional
this however is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot
this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up
this thing really wants to sing to you
it either cleans or it doesnt
i hear its good for vocals as well
for the price and free shipping this cant be beat
it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit
spot on tuning  very bright display and super fast and easy to use
at least it wont fall off soon
please just try a set of aquilas and you will hear a major difference
there is a double sleeve and a single sleeve
seams strong  seams like it will last
bright and warm at the same time
otherwise its a good idea
this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne
this can be used to  semi  record music too
i am not hard on cables
i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech
the one lone tube in the micro terror is the preamp tube
will be getting another as soon as i get daughters new guitar
this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy
ive had this for about 11 years now
but this is a bargain and small
some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks
this is a great value
the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise
at this price range this little effects pedal does admirably
i dont find changing strings that big of a bother
it arrived on time and was as described
it is tough sounds like fire and will serve you well
it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps
i havent used expensive rack units etc
not the most beautiful thing but worked
still for the money a great buy
for the price this works really well
the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies
the head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily
display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read
i recived this guitar today2813and its perfect
if you have a classical guitar get a classical capo
good value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount
it works amazing and saves plenty of time
i rinse and repeat until the tuning stays
basically if you get the right setup youll get great tone
i really dont like it
i use it a lot on my practice rig
not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago
it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm
if you want to get the right effect this is a good choice
i bought to use for my squire strat
i have 4 of these so far will get more if needed
it takes a while for the shipping but thats stated in the description
i dont have the matching extension cabinet because i just dont need it
used it for more than a year with no issues
like my title says this gets the job done and is well built
it really is versatile as well as noiseless
it looks very stylish and functional as well
no issues  no problems only positive things to say about the oil
the only downside is that its a bit rough on any loose skin
you cant go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick
i must say in the beginning i was not thrilled with the product
and then to go out to test some more
they are 8020 and i prefer those to the other strings out there
if its there i missed it
this is a brand ive come to trust
maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one
it feels solid wellconstructed and not very heavy
you just press the button and start plucking strings
they are also in a good color so they dont stand out too much
but the sound that comes out of that 834 speaker is big
i tried this about 3 months ago
sturdy had it for a few weeks now
and you cant beat the price
the title pretty much says it all
i was not a fan of this particular capo
its simple and works well
it is very small  a little bit larger than a grape
there is also a 14 line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment
works seemless and great with a headset
the mxr csp202 or dunlop custom comp is exactly what id been searching for
the terms bait and switch come to my mind
it holds up very well also
i hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase
not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips
i had changed my strings with some new martins i got recently
it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians
once installed you are good for life
these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well
tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank
the many reviews were absolutely correct
i am completely blown away with these headphones
one such as the screws packaged in actual twistnlock anchors
i needed picks so i ordered an assortment
but i bought this one and im glad a did
bak and  then save them as wdmausb
i cant speak on the claim for a longer string life
wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables
and my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs
the range of fit seems pretty good to me
the best few bucks youll spend on guitar care
very nice metronome with just enough features
sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion
i needed some fretboard cleaner
this guitar with amplug just sound amazing
this has been a very useful tool
i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individuals needs
there is no mid way on this pedal either
this is your best option for a top flight pedalboard
i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere
nice quality and good price too
i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar
would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but
i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation
i really like the 38 second looping function
the transparent rubber piece does the same job
however those strings just didnt have enough bass and too much highs
this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great
still a great guitar string
dont let that keep you from checking this hot rod out
this little device is more than worth the money
most the reverb selection sound identical
sixth you can add an sd card not included to expand the memory substantially
after a few performances i let go and left the amp at home
what more can you ask for at roughly 2500
but thats not a problem any more
tuning is quick and simple
it can do some strange things and get unique sounds
all in all a good but not 34perfect34 stand
ive tuned violins guitars and ukeleles with it
it measures 4 1634 in diameter so check your guitar closely
i do not have much to say about this
the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well
works as intended and maybe more
i bought this as a second tuner for gigs
well constructed with quality woods saddlenut and bracing
i just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference
i use mine with ukulele and guitars and both get tuned accurately with it
i dont understand the clip for a tuner on this thing
and the result sounds really right
for 30 there is no reason not to try it
after four more hours the a string went
it doesnt come with the cord what a surprise
theres a nicelycompartmentalized carrying case
good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups
were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line
good upgrade fender vintage springs
the base for this thing is a monster
but the arm is so fragile
nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp
believe me you figure it out at this price point
especially when i bust out the old tascam 4 track cassette
i like purple and it is purple
i like the soft sandy feel of these
i does the job that i wanted it for
updateafter using this microphone for a while i find it to be somewhat lacking
there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market
wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe
this stuff is the best bargain on the market
im serious try it before you die
this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off
very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it
this is a fine product
although im not onstage bouncing aroung
no issues at all and would order again
for the money its a great pedal
ive always been partial to nickel wound particularly semiflatwound but i digress
the nodelay headphone jack is great
what can i say about a guitar strap
very sturdy and light enough to easily carry
just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string
i should have totally returned this product
ive been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now
does the job for now
i am however an electric gitty player primarily
just clip it on and tada
windows 7 didnt need to install any driversit was plug n play
definitely the best looper ive come across
it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow
ill try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said
the switch is also loose
this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut
who plays his electric guitar daily
i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal
just like the ones in the store
its heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo
the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal
the quality is good i would say  not great but not terrible either
the reason is its not designed properly
reality  lets say the stand held onto the guitar
my favorite is this delay and the echo
nice tone last a decent amount of time and theyre cheap
it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection
it sounds ok for the price
my music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much
it is not so tight as to fatigue but the response is positive
i actually like this bench a lot
i dont get excited about the latestandgreatest very easily
i have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for squiers
i needed nylon core strings
these are nicely made and the one i bought is working well
i just held down the setmarker  record button while plugging the usb cable
i forgot how dim led lights are
i like dunlop products but
the padding is also excellent and comfortable
im building a speaker cab with a jensen 6 speaker just for this amp
i am very glad i got the h2
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls
the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable
this tuner is very accurate
this product is exactly what they say it is
i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin
this meant drilling out the holes by another 18 of an inch
definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future
theres too much tension to do it with your fingers
plus this will look good on camera
i figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month
as a result i feel im  either too tall or too short
this thing is way smaller than i expected
ive owned several multieffect pedals in the past even one digitech
this is a fairly good size cloth at that
this is my second one for my other guitar
very well made and durable
has multiple patterns to collect sound
its 25ft long as promised
i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking
also known as shimmer a synth playing behind your instrument
of course amazon is always 5 stars in my book
within six months of its introduction jams and festivals became seas of intelli tuners
after a while it just stopped working
i use it on all my condenser mics
it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand
daddario is my favorite string hands down after almost 40 years of playing
i think its better than the sovereign
ive never used strings that bend so well
love the sealed bags to keep the air tight seal
guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic
not sure why i did not try them earlier
this custom gauge set plays great
good upgrade for my squier deluxe strat
same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory
used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 strats
this is a modeling amp
color is good and as pictured and it doesnt seem to scratch easily
it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away
before judging this pedal please experiment on its placement on your pedal board
you will not be disappointed
the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd28
the builtin mic records very well compared to those tiny handheld monorecorders
allinall its a good strap for the money which wasnt much
easy to use and the clip is sturdy
very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session
simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding
i also use it for an older digitech pedal and works like a charm
went together perfectly and i really wanted it
i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport
i have several for our electrics and acoustics
i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning
as a spare cable to play at home though its pretty good
im very happy with this pedal
i will keep this short
i get a good clean sound on my vocals
its easy and clear and everything a tool should be
it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble
a very good price for an excellent product
the sm7 was a redesign of the sm5
id recommend it over more expensive capos any day
these didnt last long at all
i had previously owned it digitech jam man i also try the boss
this one is probably closer to a 150 guitar
the output is also a little less sensitive than the d5
a must to keep wood looking fresh
overall i have to say that im satisfied with the fender polish cloth
compressionsustain wise this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise
very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing
if not then the fishman is more your speed
the replacement amp exhibited the same problems
i found that others had the same issue
i bought it for my church and the drum sounds great
they are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice
they look great it is indeed real ebony with a pearl inlay
not sure about these picks yet
raising it is a different story though
but then my fender doesnt have a pigs snout
the downside for me is not the guitars fault
it is sturdy easy to fold away and easy to setup
high gain settings even something basic like a marshall jcm900 were practically unusable
first it did not appear that anything was coming out
some days i hate it
cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster
i have two of these
without a doubt a very sturdy cable
these are niceand this was easily the best price around
this was a good purchase
the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist
this on the other hand is not a lowquality instrument
inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners
great folks to deal with
these tend to last me about 3 months
so good that i bought another one
this cable is great for xlr microphones or diboxes
wash up in soap and water and let dry
what is this amp exactly
not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze
it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive its almost painful
the single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag
that was initially what brought me to the micro
for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders
i think youll like this guitar enough to not knock it around
its quick its accurate and it just works
i run it through a baggs paraacoustic preamp or my fishman aura
the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other lessuseful effects
i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle
inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars
it leans wayyy too far back
they bend quite a bit and are very easy to use
feels great to finally have professional sounding music
the response of the exps sounds very consistent to my ears
when he was done he said i love this mic
i dont know what i was expecting
the cutter even works well
if you need one might as well be this one
people cant belive its a 50 dollar mic when i tell them
it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on
love love love this pick holder
the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels
a much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers
long lasting made with quality
but dont let the pocket be the selling point
ive been looking for 34the34 portable amp for some time
when it comes to music it is34 that little extra34 that makes the difference
ive just got the shure sm58 microphone
all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts
technical support is also almost zero
installed on a tele i built
its the best strap money can buy
they work well with my cedar top guitar
my acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand
the portability factor is huge in my opinion
if you havent tried em theyre worth a shot
this is a well made table top stand
for ten bucks you cant go wrong
on stage makes some very nice products
they dont touch the floor
maybe its just me but thats how they come across
works wellseems to hold up well alsotreatment lasts for awhile
i bought a second one
i had them shipped to my business address
i am not an expert on guitar strings
a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also
i bought 2 of these hangers and theyre rocksolid
i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply
this was really a mind blowing thing
this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer
it was packed well and didnt have any damage on it
and gotten the 12 channel one
no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc
would recommend to any level of guitar player
i give them a thumbs up
clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio
sounds fantastic and is solidly built
thought about new sensor mullard ris or sovtek el84m7189s
provides a cool bright clean white light and will cover three or four pages
great buy cant go wrong here
this cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use
i wasnt expecting it to be such high quality
i am very glad i made this purchase
this is a great microphone
this cleanspolishes all of my guitars great
you can also do this with all the other channels too
looks vintage but works great at a great price
i may not even need that focusrite box now
i dont remember who makes what strings for what companies though
is comfortable as this type of strap can be
decided to try the dunlop
very nice effects on both channels
however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one
the knobspots are nice and the basstreble pots are notched at 12
i am very pleased with this purchase
honestly the strings are great
i have a 1918 chezch violin and its sparked my 11 year olds interest
this is my first noise reducer
who says ernie ball cant make good acoustic strings
it really does react to your playing style
its especially perfect for garage and bar bands
the only drawback is you cant have your ipad in a case
this is very ruggedly made i think it will last for ever
great price great tuner worth the buy
34  ive been used to the traditional 3position switch on my other telecasters
tuned them down to a sharp b flat
i have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars
the pedal works as described
has a black finish on it
they say that they are true bypass but they are not
someone else seems to think its made by epiphone
one star just for it getting here on time
im sold out on joyo pedals
with interior pocket to put your accesories like capo string winder etc
its a darn guitar miracle at 40
i will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases
a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
i love the joyo pedals
it has performed better than i had expected
i havent jacked it up all the way
anyway it all comes down to preference i suppose
600l is the exact same string gauges
the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly
give these picks three days and youllnever go back to another style
much better than standard industrial strength velcro
we all have our likes and dislikes
imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity
the range of thicknesses generally works well and daddarios tend to be pretty consistent
it is a good thing it does not cost a lot
the pop sound is completely removed with the filter
not as a professional tube driver but quite well for the price
when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them
what would i recommend you purchase
great product would recommend to any guitar player
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day
i usually use dunlop big stubby 20 picks
i read the reviews of the few similar options
theres lots of gain available
elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic
plus wow its a great price
ive not yet had a broken string with them
it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point
be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly
regarding sound quality my recordings have never sounded better
these cables are no different
by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little
its also nice for cleaning
the padding is good and soft
but i will order more
i dont typically use the metronome feature but its nice to have it
the material is nicersofter than the original so that is a plus
this left the saddle too low to the neck
what else can be said that isnt implied in the title of this review
did the job for what i needed
he is very pleased with these picks
brings your instrument into deadon ringing true tune across the instrument
this is a good deal
wonderful setup and i highly recommend it to to all martin owners
bottom line you get what you pay for
these are the strings for takamine guitars
my first tuners battery it came with lasted over a year
they were the right size
i bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar
in fact i use behringer xm8500 mics  3 pack for 60
i love these dunlop capos
i have never been much of a fan for coated strings
these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought
spend more money get some quality mics
and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars
but i loves me my musicman
does what it is built to do
10 ft is nice for home
i would recommend this purchase to any one
this was a great compromise between portabilitystorage and sturdiness
my stomach doesnt feel wrenched anymore
the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place
nice mic to record acoustical instruments
i guess im just too used to the big pick
again this material seems to be nonmarring
an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
i was getting hum from some of my cheaper cables
will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day
this will increase the life of your strings
ive had the digitech xseries multidelay for many years
this pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture
youll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes
ive used the boss rc20 and the digitech stereo jam man
but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument
and found i like the one that came with it at least as much
i gave it four stars for that reason
some are very dull looking
this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugerabehringer product
the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend
one customer said it did but mine did not
other then that it works just like it says it will
its an excellent overdrive and an incredible value
scratch free durable machine washable
i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price
i adore the sound and the reliability
i tried martin strings once and hated them
i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box
i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness
the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders
the primary use is for a laguna acoustic
the mic has loud voice in my karaoke
i really like these strings
this is a great product that does what it says
ive banged mine around a bit and its stayed in one piece
the buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install
im borderline skinny and it still wont fit
love the thing so far
reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record
i highly recommend them especially the ones with the builtin vibration sensor
it works but the levels are too low
for the cost these are a smoking deal
it fits the mic well
liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads
ive had this for several years
very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick
the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar wont fall off
that is a great strap and has held up wonderfully
all the hype and positive reviews you read are all true
they shipped in less time than expected
and i like the sound better
guitar string 95 between 9 and 10
way to stiff and small for me though
installed with no problems plays pretty well so far
update  1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong
but why not use the best when i can
onoff so im not sure how you can rate them as poor
no instructions came with the package
i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex
that would make this one the best
everything rolled into one product
my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale
amazon always comes throughwithout a hitchit was delivered as usual before stated time
i guess there was some mild crud buildup you cant see
snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly
i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews
wet means more of the effect and dry means less
i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though
for the price u cant go wrong
i finally concluded that there was no difference
is this the best digital delay on the market
even so it was a good quality button
this stand is made of quality products
im not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with
i am very pleased with this music stand
this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones
this is a winwin buying decision as far as i am concerned
in short it works great the sp01 isolates the mic extremely well
i wish it had a power switch
either way it gets you what you want
not to mention that its hard to strum and sounds awful
you download the firmware and install via the usb port
it is also handy portable and easy to take places
these stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced
the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones
this requires of course the addition of a 14 inch adapter plug
as for leveling it seemed ok
i dont plan on keeping it long
with this amp everything is built in
i use it the most of all my pedals because its pretty much perfect
it is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open
this guy really had me believing in smallvibrationtuning
nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though
micing for larger venues would work just fine
to my ears its not in the same spot on all presets
dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface
i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly
really helpful both in live gigs and at home
some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation
i use this mainly with a double neck bassguitar
these are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard
also it costs less money
it has done a pretty good job with many recordings especially in the field
it fits snugly but well
im 6 so it might not be high enough for a very tall person
but at least on an initial run im glad i bought it
this is basically the leatherman multi tool for guitarist
i like it and it was well under the price of others
you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap
the interface does not match the rp 255 and has a lot more provisions
it is small enough to be out of the way while playing
indeed this little bluelighted wonder will make you famous
my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding
the two together make a nice portable recordingproduction combination
i have done it for you
oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound
im pretty happy with this cloth
i use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar
i was surprised at how comfy it was at the price
if its a new project always drill pilot holes anyway
it helped me create a separate fuzzdistortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile
the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though
they cost less money and i think the parts are interchangeable
this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics
the other unit seems to be rock solid
this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price
the variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects
i also know what notes are in each chord
good mixers especially for multitrack recording can be complex and difficult to learn
they also last quite a long time maybe 7 months
its a power adaptor so it isnt too exciting but it works fine
this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm
there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds
i havent regretted the purchase
it does the job perfectly
tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound
the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings
i use this little guy in connection with my daw and digital piano
it actually really surpassed my expectations however
it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product
i bought this for my daughter for christmas
two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide
sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables
you might only have 3fx left
i love this strap try one you wont be dissapointed
it supplies my microphones every time i run out
too much bass and other garbage
not too difficult to tune either
i have this on a cream colored stratlike guitar and it looks great
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal
these jjs work really great
shouldnt it have a full battery since it is brand new
unbeatable in price and quality
again i am more than satisfied
i would recommend this to anyone
some of us arent that luckyor giftedor smart
just dont wander too far off
it all came off pretty easily
ive tried several 34portable amps34
with the ipad this isnt as noticeable
these things last forever for someone who only plays casually
disclaimer i would only recommend the nanoweb not the polyweb
this is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus but distinctly noticeable regardless
i like them i dont love them
july 20 2012 just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat
the plastic is solid but not unbreakable
who says you cant afford the good stuff these days
i got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens
i cant see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all
thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob
for the price it is worth
lasts a good long while
id recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure its secure
so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio
that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience
every guitar player should own this tool
not what i thought i was getting  dumb me
great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced
it is not what i received
at less than half that its a steal
the item shipped in time
the mc401 is compacl but its heavilyconstructed so it stays put
if you dont your guitar will hang a bit cockeyed
its a small amp but its bigger than i thought it would be
the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made
they are fun and kitschy
and these headphones fit well
speaking of power adapters  a previous reviewer is right
i thought it worked great for my needs
i highly recommend this upgrade
its so easy to apply and doesnt leave any messy residue on my fingers
it really made playing easier for me
what else is there to say
a bit invasive and awkward
exactly the same as describe here love the sound and easy to play
i have other behringer gear and it always works
the stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended
if you are considering this instrument dont hesitate
a phaser is a very specific sound but i love it in small doses
sweet chorus i have the ce5 the ce20 a ce3 and this one
the item came quickly and as decribed
it holds your condenser mic very solid for a worryfree session
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy
i cant wait to get it through my other amps
padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected
i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio
my how things change when you can see what is really going on
you get what you pay for
ive been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011
different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above
this headstand works like a charm
i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely
this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever
have to reorder soon  great strings for the money
