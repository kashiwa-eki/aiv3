at first i was not sure what i was looking for
these will save you time guaranteed
mine did not have this problem
im using them with both acoustic and electric guitars
i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand
ive never heard a bad tone out of mine
the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts
the quality is fine and it does what its supposed to do
with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever
you get 2 in package with screws so i have a spare
when you solo the vocals you can tell which is used
thank you godps for making such good quality products
works very well with no problems
the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great
easy to assemble and feels solid
this is my 6th joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint
can get many different types of sounds and drive from it
is comfortable as this type of strap can be
this is a high quality microphone
great strings for just a little more
it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it
other than the strange color they are good picks
the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money
the last thing i want to mention is the xlr preamp
it is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it
you can count on planet waves quality
cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel
this is a great size
just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair
i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price
i wanted a third guitar just for kicks
although the snowflake doesnt use a spring clip it suffers from the same limitation
just be extra careful handling them
ive tried many and these are the best by far
im sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound
very pleased with this item
at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth
he is very pleased with these picks
i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use
i would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical
well here are is the long term 100 secure solution
thats plenty high for me even if i were a vocalist and im 61
however i have yet to try it with my multitrack studio
after trying to use it i promptly returned it
excellent tuner with one flaw
what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect
first of all 20 ft is not too long
yea how could a music stand be amazing
i found the screwon connector to not be that high quality
olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls
is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
i have had good luck with wd40 too but it is very flammable
overall this is a great board
just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension
the price is darn good as well
i like tortex and this isnt but
nice flexible easy to hold and i received on time at a great price
the 57 also seems to have more low end girth
i went with the mediums
that at some point the tradeoff does indeed make sense
cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it
seem to be of a good value
the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much
im a songwriter and record my own demos at home
never come up short again
they work well for that
that is some stiff cardboard
for that i gave four stars instead of five
this is a great program for nondrumming one man bands like me
these are great strings worth the money and sound great
the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen
rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain
always spot on with the frequency
for electronics the voltage has to be correct
the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus
its marketed as an overdrivedistortion
the c1 fits the mount perfectly
it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings
this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster
these mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room
i play 2 gigs a week on average and practice everyday
this is the best capo around and works great
behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals
dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible
i usually only have to change my strings once a month
my primary instrument is electric bass
after all if i ding this one up i havent broke the bank
i bought this to work with my 9 year old son
the winder is nice and the clipper works well
the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards
i only just received these but thought id give my first impression
the downside for me is not the guitars fault
builtin string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus
clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone
if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices
works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks
this is good but it takes some getting used to
no more feedback or waking up the next room
just thoughtyou ought to know
everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs
i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar
well made and the perfect length for my needs
i had to have more like an addiction
the sound is excellent the playability comfy
this was my first shoulder rack and i didnt know what to expect
but it works fine never had any problems with it
so sexy with my sg
trying out a few new types of picks and different weights
no need to find a special driver either
just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc
its not rough on my neck and is very adjustable
if it will reach its great
great buy i am happy with it
i bet if you bought one you would like it
i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt30
lasts a good long while
behringer all the way you can keep your expensive boss pedals
i am proud to have this product
i really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening
i wont have to listen to them
before judging this pedal please experiment on its placement on your pedal board
you can use delay just not with very rapid repeats
excellent product at a righteous price
these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable
get the 28 strand for a thicker snap
my first concern was will this damage my guitar
they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect
i thought it was awesome until i learned better
but no issues besides that
one of the internal amps will no longer power up
the tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice
my connections were on and off i thought i had a dead pedal
heres the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender
he clearly was good with an ebow
tis makes it a little awkward to carry
without this tool i dont think i would have been so lucky
what more can you ask from a tuner of this price
just slightly heavier feel but much more tone
the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not
a super cool little tin
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day
the construction is pretty basic
saves space at cramped gig sites
these picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side
this amp did a good job for its rating
a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power
trick  treat your room with sound deadening
i should start by saying that i did not buy this from amazon
for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect
if the amp couldnt do it naturally when it comes to dirty tone
unlike a nice 20 pound amp the chord wont pull out
it is not overly strong or stable but the prices was right
also i read several comments here that this isnt a high gain distortion
if not just buy a cheap about 6 adapter like i did
i would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user
this holds guitars very well
the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand
if you wanted to tune and didnt have a 14 input good luck
the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on
pretty sweet guitar for the price
this does a fine job of cutting even a thick e bass string
the standard 9v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun
the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing
very clean sound very versatile
so if you want 24 different distortions go for it
this is a wonderful product for the price
the nine leds really light up my music stand
update 8212   ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric
i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential
the 299 models are great right out of the box usually
ive been playing daddario xls in their standard
thats because youre hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones
its very stable and in tune all time while playing
i really like all of them
however adding a 10 for this item is worth it
ill stick with dunlop gator grip
they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers
if you havent tried em theyre worth a shot
frankly im not a fan of most onboard effects with combo amplifiers
i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke
i didnt want to spend 600 on a wah with a rack
a plugandplay usb device with both input and output audio jacks
high quality product and very easy to install
you will not regret it
knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm
does it do exactly what you want a simple slapback echoreverb to do
i like how it smells does that make me strange
likes  size assignable knobs
ill probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that its intact this time
secondly the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions
for a nice strum these are fine
classic is a slightly lower gain more midboosted sound
this was my first fender amp as well
i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface
elixir is a wonderful company
i needed it for nothing else so im happy
look at the other reviews and you wont be disappointed
would the adhesive dry out on this and 2
a great amp for practice and beginners
a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass
i have no problem with it but the hola
it now rest at bottom of a box
im a new user but seem to be a great product
it will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the master
but its a very good strap
i will definitely be washing my hand right after using it
could not get to fit small sound hole
but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem
it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear
one less accessory in the little bag now
that iswhen i decided to get the dunlop polisher  cleaner
it will sound a lot better and its not too much more expensive
it is fitted snugly and well made
high recommend this to any stringedinstrument players
the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip
i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings
i am starting out learning to play guitar
good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets
for the price i dont think it can be beat
a great simple idea that im glad someone put into production
felt comfortable even with its larger size
the seat is very soft and comfortable
because when its switched on without the battery theres no sound coming from it
this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while
ive always tuned my ukuleles by ear
these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well
i prefer gold or silver rings at the end
the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus
more organic than plastic picks
i love my levys jacquard straps
it should work very well with any size acoustic guitar
when youre satisfied just hold again to enter regular onoff mode
expect less for that price
it felt like my guitar hung around my neck
i thought this pedal would do the trick
this is the only tuner you need
it costs 5 or less delivered
despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely
enough grip to stay put in hands well too
its a bit thinner than the average cable
so i heard these were good and ordered one to try
this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price
they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there
i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet
i found it really warmed up my sound in a good way
if you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here
worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose
this little amp will sound great
its at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe
ive been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems
fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare
and they sent a case
i bought another set for the ovation this time
it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space
the same is true of a lot of audio gear
these are much more flexible so they last forever
i installed these on a silvertone sd10 which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar
not expensive was less than
i paid a bit over 12 and it was an amazon prime purchase too
its also not the same size as the one in the photo much wider
this is a hard shell tolex covered case
52514  i said the case had no handle well i take that back
your uke is going to come with crappy strings change them to aquilas
the strings stayed in tune
i mean shouldnt it just immediately work
this is a very good strap lock system
the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal
great product worth every penny
this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is
they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great
all in all im very pleased
i like cakewalks software better anyways just my preference
this was a good choice
youll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum
i believe its zinc alloy but thats fenders fault
did i mention this sucker is big
the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal
these new ehx pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass
it is rather heavy and i like that
my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree
it is a euro stand so it has 5827 threads
it is basically a toy
i only use about 7580 percent
i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine
cheap to buy but cheaply made
the tool works great and is sturdy
they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat
the fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great
spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere
about ten dollars a set which is really good
i also really like the daddario pures
lets get a few things straight from the start  i love effects pedals
none has ever failed me so far
i have to say it is spectacular
it is of course difficult to tune when others are playing around you
i use ctype snapon strap locks but they will no longer fit
not all gold hardware is the same color gold
it was a great item
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists
weight and sound is the same
i may end up gluing it in place
ive used the classic kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars
great recorder on so many levels
ive used stands for over 27 years and this is the best ive owned
not great but not bad as well
within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt2
if you dont youll wish you did
i have several different slides glass brass steel short long etc
ive tried and replaced several
i dont know the limit of overdubs but i havent reached it
then its the wrong amp
the neck is perfectly finished and fast
i have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds
not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore
so for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather
super buy on this miniamp
i just put this on my dot hollowbody
i use this all the time
it looks good as while
i do need a boom to keep the mic
i would recommend this strap to all
and the bx5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine
id seen this one on youtube and thought its little bobble head looked
this one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorry
use it with an sm58 shure mic in a studio type application
and you get that rockstar feel throw picks at the audience
it gives a variety of sounds
the metal housing screws into the jack
it cost me 2090 with shipping
i cant speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors
so now that i have it i can finally record to my laptop
id be happy using this on a welltraveled pedalboard
it is holding a shure sm57 microphone
dont be surprised if it happens to you
not much to say about foam
this is the best case ever for the money
como solo boss lo sabe hacer
this is a cheap and easy upgrade
you cant go wrong with behringer pedals
they fit in the factory hole without a problem
i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas
seems very durable switch and jacks are quality
this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well
very midrangey sound as well
i love waxing my guitars
just make sure to change them often to get the best performance
ill post an update if this speaker fails
does what it is supposed to do
i use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar
about half have worked great the other half have this odd little issue
cons its too heavy for my mic stands
not much else to say it works and looks well made
however since i love my guitar i use it anyway
this is an absolute musthave item for any gigging drummer
guitar will never fall off a strap
tripod base to get over stage cables and a boom arm with clips
first of all this strap looks super cool
the buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install
ive even put them in a vice and filed new points on them
leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button
i bought this at guitar center and now wish that i hadnt
the martin name is synonymous with quality
easy to use and perfect size
the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money
the price was great and quality was awesome
i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed
i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables
anyway i have had this tuner for a few years now
this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is 34 size
but the material is awesome
i always buy this brand
i use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar
took awhile to get used to but really liked it
this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps
it does the job well
so i have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars
a classic that will surely live on
the high strings will talk to you
easily fits in my ukulele case too
so this item is three tools in one
i got this after seeing many of my church friends using them
ive been using this for a month or so and it works as described
otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed
its easy to install and keeps things simple
this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested
the blue stuff will be more than enough
if you understand what this is for i think its a great idea
the adjustment knobs dont seem to do much either
you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs
guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on
im not sure about a transistor amp
it works on my acoustic bass electric and my mothers voice
great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar
the samson is the more delicate and refined of the two
i have had zero issues with these
with the mute it dropped to 6db
this is a nice small amp
they look nice and do the job perfectly well
just clip it on and tada
i had used some boss ce5 and ch1 and substituted them with this unit
good for the price and no regrets
its boss so it will last forever
but i took a chance  this works well on my lp
i have used it on microphone electronics to shield out rf noise
this is a solid little usb interface
an hour later guess what
i will buy one of these again
a web search will reveal countless workarounds
for the price and free shipping this cant be beat
be sure to check out all the dimensions though
i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing
i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy
perfect to try different sizes and shapes
i still love these things
we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out
you really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit
this is a way to go
glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin
might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasnt done by shipping
i also really like the nylon material
gls cables are quality cables at a good price
good build and doesnt look cheap
it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain
if you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out
i dont think you could get a better piece for the price point
over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use
i couldnt find the other one because theyre small and black
these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune
quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors
with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time
first is the bass and treble controls
im loving this pop filter
these are my favorite guitar strings
they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers
this epiphone hardshell case is a real bargain
i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases
this 2nd one im using to hang up my beats pros
its flawless in quality and doesnt give any feedback
just hit add to cart
i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these
they give some versatility in their length
could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall
i use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp
ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it
theyre also quite good on les paul style guitars if you like slinky strings
must have been built on a friday afternoon or something
it holds my heaviest books without tipping over
too much noise with one spot
to top it all off the price is right
the graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it
however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one
tension wise at d standard 1156 is ideal but 1152 is doable
easy to use and makes changing out strings easy
this is the only string ive ever used that has all of those qualities
i wasnt expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner
ultraportable by using a 9v battery instead of the ac adaptor
no need to even use my pod pro
ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid
two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want
it sounds really good on my classical guitar
i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake
you cant beat the price either
it worked with my windows 7 starter acer netbook
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
very easy to hit the wrong one
they make the notes sound like bells
i researched a ton before i bought this one
my main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate
my only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for amazon prime
i still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner
a good moderately priced guitar stand
i did a little experiment
doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo
has great pockets to carry your picks strings and tuners
i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural
it it anchored to my board
so easy to use and portable and cheap
i have no plans of changing brands now ive made the string switch
the use of the device was moderately difficult
these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price
in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist
the strap is strong and well made
on guitars it sometimes doesnt register on the low e usually moving around helps
pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate
but my effects boxes like to have separate 14 tr ins and outs
5 stars all the way
no hiss hum breath noises or distortion
it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say
despite appearances this mic is no bargain
just two controls one for volume one for compression
i bought this because i got tired of looking up byear tuners online
a flanger is also not really advisable
really helpful both in live gigs and at home
the mic preamps sound pretty good  clean and relatively quiet
if you have a lower end guitar this will make a huge difference
i dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like
it was way too short for my seagull s12 coastline
ive been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase
never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear
youll probably have to break them
my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand
theyve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings
i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life
i would highly recommend any plant waves cables
i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar
that counts for the gig bag too
fits the behringer xm8500 perfectly
in fact i typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull
it can put out up to 1700ma
we review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about products
one thing i cant stand is inferior tools
dunlop ultex picks sound much better
hes not a big kid so even 15lb
ive used these on the reg for a year
simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end
the sound quality is great
the shortcomings were huge but the convenience meant that they were tolerated
with guitars crappy strings kill it
its the most delicate amp ive owned
terrific for gigs or practice a back up or just beginning guitar
the feel is different and the sound is different
once installed you are good for life
christmas carols are lovely but spanish stuff doesnt sound so great imho
about the effects on finish
the effects are hit and miss as well
features  stable base good extension easy hand grip to lockunlock for adjusting
the big question is 34why
fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners
but for 48 dollars im  happy with purchase
i have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible
twang to slayer in a flip of a preset
people set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall
does what its supposed to do so far
im going to get another one before they decide to raise the price
this is a great price for the package
i must say thanks to those reviewers
the tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost
to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads
the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position
i keep this with my battery tester for my actives
great folks to deal with
i will buy more in the future
i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps
not only that but im actually getting to be notthatbad at playing either
if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise
i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely
i really like this pop filter
home recording or just practicing
i have this paired with the behringer c1 studio condenser microphone
they sound clean and crisp
very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows
another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software
best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off
i will purchase again for my next build
brass tacks they are velour
i will be using this model and brand as long as they make them
this pedal is very versatile
they look great and were cheap
the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism
it serves up great tones into either one
well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water
all guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there
this coding system is consistent thru all their string sets
it was brand new unopened in box
for most vocals recording i dont use the closet
as beginner these strings were not good for me
youll wonder how you ever played without it
i havent used the cable yet but it looks new and durable
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs
ive always been a fan of these fender classic picks
this is just what the doctor ordered
i was surprised at the good quality for such a little price
especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isnt stock boss
i didnt think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that
this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset
i was looking for a semisoft felt picks
these are good dont get me wrong
no noticeable hum at 34concert34 level
it helps him remember to practice when he sees it
ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing
plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action
but as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better
i easily reommend this item
ive used daddario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic
its worth its weight in gold
all three of my kids have a guitar
sustain and harmonics are insane
as a home tuner or for a brightlylit gig  excellent
this strap fits right feels good and looks handsome
they are size 1046 which is just right for my electric guitars
dont ask then why i got a sn6
one note  this does not come with any picks
they are solid durable and reliable and cheap as well
this will last a very long time
i did manage to get it on
you can get a 25 cable for under 5 also here on amazon
bought as a gift for my son and hes very pleased with it
this little foot stool is really sturdy
i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice
i use drums so nobody else gets hurt
no triangle or civil war
this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use
this is a handy little tool
anyway through the gcs3 the fullbore basically sounds like a mesaboogie
the way you string the guitar makes a difference
i dont think it lastforever but it works great for my peavey patriot guitar
can be done but not as good
it seems to be manufactured well
this does the job but its fairly thin and not all that well padded
would recommend this brand to anyone
it does not come with a mic clip so youll need to get one
they have no coating  so they squeak like hell
will purchase more as needed
great for instruments and vocals as well
buy it youll like it
with practice ive become more proficient
again the overall tone is fantastic
not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well
it is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings
not for me maybe for you
this issue is why four starts rather than five
for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish
turns out this is an amazing amp
i could not expect a better violin stand
the extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability
i bought the martin strap to match the color
the product picture can be a little deceiving
not the greatest cord i have ever used not the worst either
nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your back
bright and easy to read
i have used it in recording live band practice sessions
this one is comfortable for 10 mins then its cramp time
cheap easy to use cuts sound 70
i have to of them
i use daddario strings a lot
that way i can look from a distance
i dont think you could break this beast if you wanted to
you take the packs and put them in the sleeves
martin makes great sounding strings
but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings
the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording
these are the best strings ever
i got too much background noise with the mike
man am i glad i did
it lasts a pretty long while too
i thought the boss pedal sounded pretty bad
thats what i do anyway
they perform quietly and give a more mellow tone
it really doesnt affect play at all so it doesnt matter
these didnt last long at all
this compares to my other compression pedals i own
it is comfortable around my neck and shoulder
no need to over tighten the adjusters
i dont like these too much
nice feel to it and seems sturdy
over all im happy with the purchase as it suits my needs
they are great for jamming with friends  are so user friendly  accurate
they screw in and hold things
no rocking sideways no wobbly action
microphones cables straps tuner etc
a friend gives his time to help kids learn music
wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger
theres also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level
almost annoyingly hard to get one out
well made and a fair price too
eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned
i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag
use the crybaby with other effect pedals the uses are endless and fun
i ordered this for my husband the musician
i was skeptical because of the price but these work great
heres an entertaining howto video that will walk you through it
i shall  probably get three or four more
excellent multieffect great sounds the distortions are really great
in my opinion this is a five star product
nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings
the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks
and im the better for it
they will last for a long time and they are a good product
i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine
the other quality thats noticeable is sustain
it only cost around 60 so perfection should not be expected
i have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them
the snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable cardboard box
its small works well and fairly inexpensive
i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars
so the sample from the vine
i will not buy anther one
for the money it works
i really really recomend this one
lucky this is a good option
too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead
i purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap
its my best acoustic currently
pickups far less than inspiring
i used doublesided sticky tape  problem solved
but without it i felt cheated
solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music
this tuner is very accurate
they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick
this pedal makes my les paul sing
time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions
i completely agree with 34jpfromoh34
but i always wanted an original cry baby
no cheap way is there
i am considerng replacing my takamine minijumbo with a seagull equivalent
they always give me good picks to use
this string compares significantly to the proarte string
germany company manufacturing is in china
im using it for my alesis q49 midi keyboard
when not in use it just gets put away
anyway  no reservations about this one
this will be more than fine
i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one
strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel
didnt have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size
if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins
how does it sound you ask
i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball 4037 black polypro strapinstead
a great value for your money
the package game a little smushed so its a little misshapen
the tuner is easy to use
we will be purchasing more picks in the future
got it right b4 xmas thanks amazon
since its based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise
i record with fl studio and its even great so far
works just fine thank you
works well tunes tight and is cheap
if so have a few of these on hand and replace that nut
i like them a lot
the strap itself is plain but it highlights the beauty of my guitar
works great for the price
i bought this to sell mainly but now
itll do the job but i dont like it
i bought this recently and i love it
this one was a good deal through amazoncom
looks nice and works as intended
well built made to last and looks great
three positions roughly correspond to 18 19 and 20 inches
fits nice and made well
i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand
durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum
i have been playing guitar offon for about 30 years
excellent guitar picks of medium hardness
i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights
some i might not use but there are plenty i will use
sure its nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily
works well easy to install and take out
i cant find a modern sm57 with a switch anywhere
should have paid the extra 40 and bought the mustang  oh well
que mas se puede decir
it works fine for the handy type recorders
i like to ride my bike and take my uke along
it leans wayyy too far back
the color of the device
a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark
otherwise  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap
i feel like i am playing with a nickle
excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise
same thing with strings that break while tuning them up
this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini
constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough
ive owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk
compliments my bwb pickgaurd nicely
i think black looks better with my guitar
this strap fits the bill just fine
ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain
probably the best kapo out on the market
a steal in my opinion
they are very good strings worth the cost
quick release around the neck strap system
another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier
oops there goes a star for the con job
the head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config
this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out
if you just want to play around a little this uke will do
this pedal is an audio swiss army knife
youd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over
i would recommend this capo
i have become a fan of gls
they are solid secure and they look great
i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return
price was a big issue
over the years ive tried literally dozens of capos
this is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest
there are some annoying things about this amp
i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area
i opted for the 300 and got it for 25
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
they fit great and plenty of screws
the sound is pretty great
clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar
the title says it all
they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look
not really that good for  music
this pick however takes it to the next level
fantastic for slide or capod high
this little amp kicks major ass dood
good price and it arrived quickly as well
i needed a jack plate for my custom stratocaster build and ordered this one
i have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings
and during the time ive tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars
put them on my daughters guitar and she enjoys them
because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks
finally i just went with this one and im pretty happy with it
i would call it average
they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone
i use the stand at home too
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well
i only use them and i have been playing for a decade
this was the first time ive ever used a string winder and cutter
i own several taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars
i put dark nail polish over the led bulb
i been playing guitar for 12 years now
its a pleasantness that doesnt grate on your ears when you pluck a string
this was really a mind blowing thing
if youre looking for an economical strap this will work great
all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries
the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is
theyve got a great product for the price point
i would recommend this purchase to any one
your situation might be different than mine
did boss just start making multieffects pedals
these heads are amazing and a very good investment
the interface is great and the clip works well
it is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price
these are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured
save your money and time
all my stringed instruments have been fitted with tusq parts
lots of good presets and capabilities
thats not what it was designed to do
i couldnt have hoped for more from these stands
i own a native instruments maschine mikro
pros  fits on any guitar
the display is large and bright
i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars
well worth the small price paid
it fits exactly like an original fender hard case
recommended just remember the price point and you wont be disappointed
i use there 100 30 and 25 cords and have never been disappointed
the sm sounded muted compared to d5 without any sound modification out of box
both mine measured 4534 from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended
the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile
unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the 5th star
the locking mechanism is great
they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise
the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it
in a chain running into an amps input there is a slight volume increase
with fretted basses id always liked strings with a little brassiness
i own three other behringer pedals as well and theyre still going strong
i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it
73 mm is right for me i really like them
he badly needed an upgrade from his ludwig jr kits bass pedal
it works on my pinky finger
whether dubbing audio recording instruments or just yelling at the top of your lungs
i previously used krk rp8s so i can compare these to them
dont get this if you have man hands
its not going to unlock on you
i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat
my level is usually around 25 to 40 and is still very loud
please dont listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldnt keep tune
not a huge deal if youre using a standard mic clip
but my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long
you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs
it looks feels and sounds amazing
once you get the hang of this capo its wonderful
what else can you say
driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones
and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul
ive been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now
for the price this lil guy does the job
i read the reviews on ernie ball strings
the picks work well and they dont wear out easily
on these i use the lights9s
do be careful when unfolding as pinching of skin would be very easy
with a bit of tweaking is fine for studio work
i put these 150s on all of my strats regardless of the brand
they get better with wear
they last a long time if you wipe down after use
this one is an ivoryish color and it is really nice
perhaps a straight to straight would be better
i believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs
i have them installed on all of my guitars
if it lies flat then so is the fingerboard
these cables didnt disappoint me either
the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor
no good out of the boxplug it nothing
i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well
i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage
they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap
no stress whatsoever indeed its just as quick and smooth as my boss
this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely
wow is all i can really say
and the es57 is equal to the shure sm57 at 6000 less
plus they feel and sound good
ill post up a picture later
peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners
but these work fine easy to get strap locks on
this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genzbenz bass amplification company
if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one
im glad i chose them as they play easily and have a nice sound
they do the job and they feel great
i was amazed at the tones i could pull out of it
i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar
so it works well for that
i use it with boss and ibanez pedals and it works great
i have a vintage 60s dixon hummingbird
easy on my fingers too
all 12 picks were there
not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
ive used ernie balls slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades
i prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway
but the arm is so fragile
going to upgrade electronics and everything else too
my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery
im using it as a spare so it should be ok
if it didnt have this fizz i would give it a 5 star rating
ive had many mic holders and this one is by far the very best
i bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case
this is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much
i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek
you wont find that in anything else under 300
this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case
so far still made in america
one concern is that the linked power cables dont have anyplace to disappear into
crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it
i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc
i think so as well but i cant quite quantify it
this guitar will make a player proud
i had this happen once
all and all a super practice amp or micable performance amp
the playback sound is very good quality
the term stomp box isnt supposed to be taken literally
they cost less money and i think the parts are interchangeable
these really arent a very good value
i have found this to be true
i put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less
i was a little skeptical having used other strap lock systems
however with this price i wouldnt complain at all
in my opinion this thing is well worth the price
very good for a quick tune up
i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade
i dont get excited about the latestandgreatest very easily
there was no perceptible delay
came with more screws than i needed
hold a tune very well and sound good
this is the first harmonica i ever used
this dunlop 5005 pick holder work good
012s ive been using which i think i liked a lot better
this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack
i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from
both ended up in checked luggage
so far ive been super pleased by joyo pedals
the design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud
this proco rat pedal does not use that
this is a good quality capo
my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive
so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain
by far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass
tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing
what will they think of next
this capo was just perfect for my needs
i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball
now put that order in
i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u35pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink
most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass
i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them
disclaimer i would only recommend the nanoweb not the polyweb
it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great
ease of use is tops ever
i will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future
it is cheap so you should just get one
gets the job done and it is inexpensive
if you havent changed your saddle
i always go with elixirs
so i decided to sign in and write this review
instead its very edgy and smooth as can be
heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played
im raising my rating and the result
i realy like the cutter
you dont buy 15000 pickup for a 200300 instrument
i love this its do fun to play with
he really likes it a lot
very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners
i am thankful that i did not have any of said cracks or chips
almost a perfect pic for me
it is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece
i dont have not one bad thing to say
no sign of wear and tear
i dont know i think so  others may not
ill update how i hook it up
i love this boost pedal so much
just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this
not all chords are in here but the 34core34 chords are
transparent in your signal chain when off as well
not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar
there is plenty of room for all my needed connections
the interference went away after a few minutes
it is second place on my list
i will edit in the future if necessary
i was expecting something a little bigger
i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges
havent used it for anything else though so cant comment there
the apogee jam works great and it sounds great
a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows
adjusts easily nice quality leather hookups
im a blues guitarist so they take a beating well
this is not my only capo but its my cheapest
very good item if you are a musician you need it
unfortunately it doesnt fit on top of our harp
if it sounds too good to be true it usually is
you cant go wrong with aquila
i had the replacemnt in about four days
this is a good stand
just a bag for my guitar stand
been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else
well made proven over decades
this is certainly your metallica amp
anyway it doesnt seem much more then a normal gig bag
its perfect for 23 acoustics and 12 electric guitars
every one in my band uses this tuner
i often record one part of a duet then play along with it
i just learned last night how to coil them up
the big 34selling point34 about the mm is that it has a top boost
her reason for her opinion is simple
luckily i keep that on hand
theyre very small about the size of a nickle so youve been warned
i chose these strings based on reviews i have read on the website
will probably have to manufacture something to replace it
the enclosure is a smaller pedalboardfriendly size
this pedal solved my problem with my amp
you can just leave the plate off if you want
maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument
i put a set on my strat and tele
comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it
these are niceand this was easily the best price around
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item
it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it
makes changing strings a whole lot easier
worked perfectly for that purpose
i like that this is fairly light
buy one learn how to use it and youll be happy
no more need for a pedal based tuner
it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but
dont use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase
this pedal wont be leaving my board probably ever
my only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough
if you have one or many expensive guitars buy these
simply these are great cables
their grip is excellent and they feel awesome
i have a 1993 taylor which is in mint condition
i was surprised when i tested this microphone
the interface does not match the rp 255 and has a lot more provisions
works as expected and should last a really really long time
it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo
i got this pretty fast
46 starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality
it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv
nevertheless for what it is
ive been using this one for about a year now with no problems
out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output
i would buy these again
they arent rough textured so they are easier on the fingers
bright easy to read display
maybe some lock tight would help
material is rougherbut thats a good thing
designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job
you can not go wrong with daddario strings
im just running out of wall space and money for new guitars
i like the tones i get from these and the price is very good
also does make the neck a lot smoother
ive been very disappointed with this tuner
historically i have sworn by these though
in fact there really werent that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market
daddario xl nickel woundregular light gauge exl110bright round wound
this instrument might actually be in a class of its own
i was a fender or daddario guy and eb ss were beneath me
i have used all kinds of strings
i have been a gigging musician for over 20 years
build quality is as solid as they come
i am pleased with the product
with the snark any of them
anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws
not as noisy better feel
and im rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar
i will probably get another
its all just so much marketing garbage
great stuff to have for a great price8230i like it
if youre only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware
but if it happens there will be an update to this
its solid and works well
i bought this to go with my super champ x2 combo
very simple very userfriendlyand the feature that is most important i think versatile
very good buy great packaging earlierthanexpected delivery  thanks amazon
a super cheap mono cable
it provides great sustain and distortion
75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off
i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro
ive never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is
frankly id forgotten how musical this pedal is
unless youre so amazing you can make it work every song
i tried another miniamps but all sounds like toys
it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem
a pedal does not make you play better practice does
bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot
its well made and sturdy with a metal body
it is thinner than a normal uke about half the body depth
the cable came in the time it was promised
if youre wondering how to get neutrikmogami cables cheap make them yourself
if you want a good all around microphone this is not it
they translate better with the correction curve active
10 mm is the perfect thickness
but they really are cool little stands and i just bought another one lol
i am not hard on cables
you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal
but its a good pedal effect
i applied a lot of force to pull the cord out
the real treat is the tone switch
i never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag
great that they have uniform tension
you get what its advertised to do
i use the picks occasionally
the quality and durability are there 100 well worth what i paid for
as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal
he says its easy to use and is durable
i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio
its soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat
seemed to want to be off too much
it works well for sure
it does the job as described it though
easy to adjust and holds the ipad secure
for 300 you can get a vox w an overdrive delay and reverb
pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies
either they feel good in your hand or they dont
it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight
get them if you like gilmour
as an acoustic guitar player i think this is a great product
no tone control no presence control
i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets
the things it wont do  1 a clean boost
but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings
the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate
however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet
while some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele
i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube
not too long not too short
i choose this rating cause it is the best adapter ive found
so what is the difference between the 235 and the 535
it comes with a key so you can lock it
the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling
so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue
great tone and tuning stability
hence the purchase of the pedaltrain mini
they were twice as loud as these
once it does its beautiful music after that
finally and this is important theyre incredibly comfortable
being toneprint enabled is a 100 plus
i am so glad i did
the sn1 is a musthave as far as im concerned
let me start by saying that i never even opened these
the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand
check them out they carry ok equipment
it really made playing easier for me
coated strings usually lack the bright highend brilliance that uncoated light strings have
so all i can say is that it is working well for me
installed easy and the screws and everything were correct
it comes with one free disintegrating pick
kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there
im very pleased with this purchase
it has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great
i played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonationfret buzz etc
just works so what else more can i say
the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain
dont expect it to break anytime soon anyway
i also have a more expensive capo just like this one
for the price this is an amazing pedal
i like thin picks myself and this one is very thin
but i set mine up for a few effects i use live
my experience has been that ernie ball makes great products
i have a planet waves strap with studs and i like it very much
these cables arrived in good working condition and weve been using them continuously since
however for the home player this tuner will work just fine
buyer beware for this kind of
even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the 5th star
excellent little device for the money
just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need
its well made and works well
it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics
i have used the line 6 looper in the past line 6 jm4 looper
the capo also has a handy builtin pick holder
read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal
in a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold
possibility created by the multiflex feature and the grip
and  it doesnt come with any manuals to speak of
thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok
its pretty harsh in tone  kind of a white noise distortion
for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex
are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts
glad i invested in it
for fit  i have a large noggin like size 7 58 hat
they last for months without a change in tone
this large pick  barely goes over my thumbnail area
well made reasonably priced as with most on stage stuff
id also like to see another set of outputs on it as well
so theres nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2
this tuner works for sure but i dont think its the best out there
end up losing them verses breaking
has never failed me yet
i have no complaints it is my go to mic
the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap
it just feels lighter than i like but thats a personal thing
but for metal big strings i stick with ernie ball
my acoustic guitars seem to like them too all except my 12string
i found mine used for 20 but the new asking price is fair
muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in db
not much else to say about it
check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp
fine for a few weeks now
i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage
i was surprised at how small the jam is
ive used boutique strings for many years but always come back to these
just like my taylor only louder
like these better then the bulkier dunlops
just remember use some common sense dont expect the guitar to totally stable
stand away from my guitar when im playing and singing
daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money
plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol
when used with a pedalboard rig it doesnt add much except for hiss unfortunately
i have had no problems with them
of course the durability is still in question at this point
pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price
the final time i tightened them down the high e string broke
i have several epiphone 335 dots and a gibson es335
but i love the gated reverb feature among all modes
ive purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one
can hold up to 11 picks of
now for some down sides
it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound
the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence
they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in
the fit is nearly perfect
its a flange pedal what else
i recently purchased a epiphone eb3 bass and it didnt come with a casebag
not upset about that  stuff happens
this is such a sturdy board
these are my favorite strings for electric guitar
for the price this mic is a very good deal
lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth
but you will find some gems too
cant ask much more than that from it
their differences for your  ears
i personally found the mullard to be the best
just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical
this is not one of those
i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro
never broke a string but i only play at home as a hobby
the cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines
a few minutes of rehearsal with it and youll get to like it
tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect
my inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound
please please please please do research before you buy anything
im amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice
ive heard that these can be fragile but im pretty gentle with my gear
apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad i did
the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will
no fret buzz and i just love the feel of the neck
its nothing of the sort nor should it be
i really should send this pos back to amazon
ive use these strings for years
most people dont use chorus and flange at the same time anyway
however recording a choir or something would work
touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys
this one work great for us
ive picked up a few of these for my various guitars
perfect for my obscure use
its the tube screamer of delay pedals
good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment
the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank
on stage makes some very nice products
i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets
depending on your style these might be a good choice
the fit of the headphones is big for me
these are miracle strings in my mind
i tweaked the action and the 010s are fine and ive made the adjustment
a total loss  and we had no insurance we sure learned our lesson
against a spyder iv individual tastes will vary
this does what it says it does
this is very inexpensive and works great for my homewanna be purposes
i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic
check out my soundcloud  soundcloudcomljaymusic
well built solid construction  zero complaints
good sound quality for not being bone
folds up and can easily be stored
what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish
provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volumewah pedal that works great
this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up
ive posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page
i got this pedal cause is not so expensive and i love music
i have used these picks for years now and i just love them
they are easy to use
most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others
3 the interface is clean an easy to use
so check with what you get
daddario prelude violin string set 44 scale medium tension is good deal for beginners
so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality
012s and this is one of my prize acoustics now
the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too
this pedal seems older as well
you have just simply got to try this little guitar stand
this seems like a good deal for the price
would definitely purchase it again
the case is also very well balanced with the guitar inside
also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends
i used them with my harbinger ha60 pa system and i was not disappointed
ive watched friends  bandmates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps
i zero the spring verb and use the pedals onboard reverb for best results
tune my mandolin and banjo with it
in my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass
so i play while im watching football or baseball
these cables are really the best
i have not used the pick holder yet
i expected this to come with a dc adapter
i suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside
i am not disappointed in the least
however behringer makes a distinction between the c1 and the c1u
this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations
the finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel
perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar
i had 4 mics 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set
i keep going back and forth between dr high beams and these
on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy
the display is better than most ive used dating back 30 years
i have not had to replace mine
wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass
i also have a boss gt100 multieffects unit
zero buzz across the board
they work well with my cedar top guitar
ive mostly used it with the default settings
regarding the item itself i am bit lukewarm
this is something i had not tried before
you may have experienced the problems of musicians
nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all
i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal
it seems like yes they are
sadly when i tried to use them amp it didnt work
the only thing i dont like is that the housing feels cheap
this cable seems like it will last me for a while
frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing
they project without sounding harsh or tinny
i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out
this mic is quite good for its price
i just bought a dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggy
very good tunner with bypass switch
i say why pay more
the picks weight was perfect
the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable
but 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for me
as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in
ive had this for 4 days and im so glad i bought it
it is pretty and very strong
i use this on my takamine and my tele
they were tinny and clangy sounding
you can even work it into your live performances
i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin
i got what i expected with my purchase you will too
this should be every bassistguitarists best friend
currently the h2 is my backup unit
it is affordable and the material is solid enough that it can withstand abuse
i guess all my other cases just dont measure up to this one
this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic
i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these
its performance look and feel are great
not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund
i got it for me and my dad
i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second
went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle
that means you have more green stuff to buy other things
so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h4 recorder
very good stand especially for the price
it is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open
ibanez ew20 body not neck dimensions  w 16 d 5 l 20
it presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack
theres a great video on yt from proguitarshopcom that demos it very well
i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely
these are what i use on a regular basis
most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries
one other advantage these picks have is that they never break
its a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft
its a great pick holder but im not fond of the sticky background
top is a bit wavy from buffing
nice to keep your mic nice and fresh
lcd is bright and clear and needleish display works as expected
i cant explain it exactly
the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb 11
id buy the neotech simple sling again
okay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive
bak and  then save them as wdmausb
im 511 i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still
ive had this for nearly a year and i have no complaints
i teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele
i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard
both my hot rod deluxe and blues deville came with foot switches
id allways come back to daddarios
i bought two more you will love this tuner
they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time
i like these strings for their warm  mellow tone
but darn it 6 paper envelopes
the five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste
it was a good deal did the job
its easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks
that gives this stand more value
i bought this one after using the sn2 for 5 months
it has had no issues at all
when i got my martin soprano which wasnt cheap it did the same thing
works ok for the price and features it is fine
i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar
but its really worth the hassle
i wouldnt touch anything but fender mediums for years and years
my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using
for an in expense product
i installed reaper and immediately disliked its interface
this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used
distortion is incredibly subjectiveit depends on your rig and your tastes
i play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine
probably insist on  34dont mention anybody but us
i am so in love with my 34pinkie34
this one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some ive tried
ive been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years
i couldnt be happier with the seagull s6 especially for the price
soft callouses  no callouses
the civilians wont notice the difference
price also great with budget
always found the hangingtype to be the safest  most secure
its thinner than i thought
i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up
for 10 bux each  why not
it sounds great and i like the headphone and mp3 player hookups
look forward to getting those crappy loose unsmooth original hardware tuners off this thing
the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on
compared to my other tuner its rigt on the money
it has a durable metalic case
this pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly
however all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars
my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower
the unit uses three aa batteries
strap is quite stiff but id say its worth the price
it works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen
the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar
easy to see easy to use easy to get used to
dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up
10 minutes it took for all 4 strings
not a bad price either
i really hope its a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful
it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation
got this for my electric guitar
this pedal completed that task
only downside is theres no neck support
i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had
i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board
it is similar to this one
i like the fold up into a small package idea
one on the east coast and one on be west coast
i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg
it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical
i had to be very careful to put it on squarely
i was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance
but wait a minute hold the phone
overall sounds and looks awesome
the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze
it has less granularity in the display for example
obviously i think it a good product
these are the best topping any other by far
they are what i needed
oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
this recorder is okay but its far from perfect
where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords
keep it right in your case
i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either
the solution may be this zoom ms50g
just another example of the incompetence at fender
the output impedance is less than 10 ohmsrespectable but not amazing
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done
but in our case it works beautifully
go no further for your volume pedal needs
it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on
i could not ask for better for this price
finish your serch and buy this one
these guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing
works the way its supposed to
something about eb strings they really are slinky  whatever that means
so looking around on amazon i found this handy little device
daddario strings have never failed me
stay away dont fall victim to the noob hype
maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying
the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up
i am an older person who has old eyes
this pick literally makes you play better
included with the interface is a 5 foot usb printer style cable
i love these clipon tuners
simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it
ive had this pedal for about five years
the first time i and everybody else saw one i said wow
come with all cables needed
not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap itll do
microphone preamp is soso i guess
i ordered a new tank and now its great
sweet chorus i have the ce5 the ce20 a ce3 and this one
the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain
most importantly they sound great
very pretty and nice quality
i have used gibson polishes for 38 years
working just fine so far came quickly in the mail
the switch well we will have to wait and see
i will be buying one for every guitar case i own
so first of all i want to say packaging is great
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say
elixir polywebs were the first coated string
came in time worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic
in fact its about time to order another set or three
they are great and last forever
the testers are very cheap and may show problems you werent aware of
im possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20 years
i like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to
a few basses i prefer higher
i put this in my fender mim stratocaster
try it you cant go wrong
plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and ive used just about every brand
it takes care of business just fine
this is my second set of these
beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare
mic it and you can play it anywhere
when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly
it is difficult to use in a small apartment  too loud
definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks
seems to stay in tune pretty well too
i think i may need to tighten some screws
i am extremely happy with this purchase
ive been using mxr micro chorus for over 30 years
got no complaints over these
i did find the bundled cakewalk software useless
take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal
it works great for me i like this type of straps simple  durable
their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception
the switches are rock solid
works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten
i keep mine in a protective case when i am not using it
this product does what you want and is easy to take on and off
i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound 1000x better
no expensive pads to buy just use water
im having so much fun with it
this thing is a beauty
that is the function of an eq nothing more
theres a reason all pros use metal
easy to navigate and understand
they stil play great sound great against steel strings and last a long time
you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop
despite that ive been highly impressed with its quality and sound
im a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only
good  power supply for the cheaper yamaha keyboards
but the positions it allows make sense for 99 of players
overall i recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp
blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product
the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things
the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson
light takes up little space and easy to use
for the price i dont think you can do better
pretty great strap overall and i am very very much pleased with my purchase
for years ive owned a nice at4033
i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar
yeah im the only one that sees that problem
maybe i just need a shirt with more cling
with those goals in mind i was pleasantly surprised how good the bx5 sounded
it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound
no but sounds pretty damn good
a great value for the money
the spring could definitely be tighter
and i have to say the aqua color is major retro
neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to
i was miserable my guitar sounded like s
reputedly the joyo us dream is a copy of the suhr riot distortion pedal
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good
i use a lot of behringer equipment and no i dont work for behringer
ive been hooked on daddarios for quite a while
pin 3 then ties to pin 1 with the ground wire
i have not tested its wind screen capabilities
its fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new
i ordered it and applied it
still a relatively short amount of time
our buy two more of these they are only 20 bucks
perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad
for the price this stand just cant be bet
i am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar
not complaints just works and is reasonably priced
for 50 there is seriously no better deal
emery cloth for polishing frets is niceworth 2000for sure
the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun
for this pedal they went with press on knobs
this is my first fatsoflex cable
it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows
works well enough as a filter once you get it placed
they work and sound good
this fit the bill perfectly
the attack is second to none
i  find the daddario strings will stay in better condition than others
the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated
it does all of them well
the amp is on my belt
i have several stands and this is the second one of these i bought
try it and i think youll like it
by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic 300b
they just arent quite my cup of tea
cool speaker and nice addition
if i bought eight adapters it would cost me well over 120 usd
no need to replace these pickups
i wouldnt reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage
the only thing i find worse than the intelli is the gooseneck
ill probably stick with extra light for awhile
very easy to use and lots of extra cable length
longevity yet to be seen
i like making my strings last longer
if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing dont worry
it is far superior to previous tuners ive used
does not leave streaks if used properly
and the ultimate drive does it nicely
every guitar player should keep this in their case
the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny
so someone messed up in quality control
perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable
this is a good deal
i got this to help with that
no residue no sticky and no oil film
at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot
perhaps i wind up choosing this but so far eh
amazon always comes throughwithout a hitchit was delivered as usual before stated time
do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil
would i prefer something nicer if  werent an issue
works as described on the ipad
of coursei could not recommend this product to anyone
and for the price id buy it again
this little wonder though is fantastic
the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights
i use it with distortion and overdrive with good results
was using a box and this is a great help
this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm57
i would recommend it to anyone
great price for the quantity
adjusted for inflation that would be 800 when i bought this jasmine
i do a lot of recording  i also checked the sound after recording
has more low end and a smoother mid that the ocd
this works very good on a silver flute
it is easy to use
you cant beat these for the price
i would not hesitate to buy them again
otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me
to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked
highly recommand this for anyone needs pick
an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain
it is a little loud
does what it should as expected
made by daddario the quality lives up to the brand
they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy
i love the joyo pedals
it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks
pluck a string and tune it to the dial and eureka
it sounds ok for the price
its adjustable with a pick pocket simple good quality would by another
the models of the vintage fender amps
just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
the leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit
no more battery swaps no more searching for a 9volt every 5 minutes
anyhow i digress but for a reason
these mediums work well for playing electric guitar
and for every job there is the right tool
however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend
more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice
i cant bend at all so no idea if its just me
bit too thick for me
the bright switch is an added bonus
is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition
doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though
i just keep coming back to these
order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring
this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations
the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volumewah 2in1 pedal
original reviewrecently i got the itch to try different unique picks
makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half
i hope this helpsjps  the currency is in us dollars
you can pay more but i dont think you get that much more
lets just say this id never gig with this guy as my only tuner
i defiantly recommend them for everybody else
this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals
its so much better than the elastic capos
bought a takamine 40 years ago
but it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase
cant go wrong for the price imo
like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you
016 of the daddarios i usually play
try it out for yourself
itll keep me busy for a long time
i missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered
the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion
they sound just like i thought they would
the input 14inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid
and then to go out to test some more
i bought this case for my rogue astyle electric mandolin
quality can be found behind the fender name
contrary to the name it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer
i tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards
works with the new mic my daughter got for christmas and nice quality cord
ive used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints
volume at about8 oclock and gain at about 3 oclock
cable would be ok if the end connections would stay screwed together
find something you truly love and buy that
sound 95 like the boss mt2 just not as clear as boss pedal
it comes with strings installed and almost tuned
based on this belated realization i have raised the product rating to 4stars
according to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab
the green cable is good for that
these are outstanding strings with great durability playability and exceptional sound
when done simply tap again and the led goes to green and plays back
the metronome will drive you crazy
one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply
i only wish it went up to 11
but is a well made product if you use it for what its for
latchedunlatched mode  the best feature on the pedal
so i got my full order
i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base
this system works just okay
but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character
i have had plenty of these
tuned them once no breaking in
they ring like they should
i would not do that without this straplok
its a lot quieter now
the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy
this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks
the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched
the cutter even works well
i got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars
all in all a beautifully designed and executed product
that said this pedals has some wonderful uses
you can tell when theyve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling
these work better for me than any others ive tried
i enjoy this product and i definitely use them on my acoustic
you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp
and i love this tuner
ive used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting
it is amazing what difference the strings can make
crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous
i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
i will be buying more in the future
they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break
but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok
i completely agree with that
this one is a good meet in the middle of those two
its a nice little amp good for carrying around
also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet
otherwise youll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup
i have no hissing and no problems
including many delays and echos
you also have to get ra taken altogether this makes it a deal breaker
i love my laptop a thinkpad t40
for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality
this made me take a second look at schaller
even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings
this case will fit the 335 dot casino sheraton and the gibson es335
i have always used tortex picks
this cable is an amazing find
it has a good ring to it
i would recommend these to anyone
this particular unit seems to be built pretty well but time will tell
you can easily set your intonation with this little monster
this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro
i bought this 12 pack and they
i didnt hear it when i mixed my hafler m1 speakers
the finish is a bit more orange than pictured
after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew
large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch
exactly what i needed at a great price
its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musicians
ive been trying different strings for years
the backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this
it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well
that being said using the looper was an eye opener
this is a good thing  its sensitive
granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors
i would recommend these to anyone
replacement pads can be bought on amazon
also since a purchased a 3 pack
not happy with the sellers description or the product
i havent regretted the purchase
what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound
the price is right and shipping was right on time
ive played 6 strings 12 strings bass acoustics and electrics
love it love it love it
this amp out does my old roland cube 60
the plastic thumbpicks match tone very well
behringer is a problematic company for me
it is sensitive and accurate
nothing out of the ordinary
im borderline skinny and it still wont fit
its light and feels comfortable when you carry it
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele
what you need to know about this mic 1 this mic is very directional
they feel goodsound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set
this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratchproof stance
the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument
this is a great strap for the money
this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words
this means their stuff is made to last
the distortion was much more fizzy
one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile
and i have a ton
so ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now
the price for the replacement packets
the picks have almost zero flex to them meaning the player has solid control
same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory
anyway i figured since the pedal was so cheap why not try it out
they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels
you really cant go wrong with a set of these
really brings out the beauty of true wood
i bought the special 20 pro packkeys ga  c
ahhh this is a guitar strap
try the behringer cs400 for more sustain
the whole unit is heavywood and very durable
this capo design works best for me
ive had it just over a month so amazon wont help me
oh and not to forget
it is also just great to 34hang34 on the headstock went not in use
however i am really liking them
great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness
holds it in place and are of high quality material
the answer to that question is surprisingly good
otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars
it isnt top of the line but it gets the job done
otherwise a great hanger that i trust for use with my expensive guitars
always great products and always dependable
so i replaced with these
i have a fulltone ocd after the zoom
it was the strings and im very glad i replaced them with these strings
footswitch includes channel and boost buttons
but as a backup stand i wouldnt hesitate
do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit
line 6 please go to sdhc
its simple basic but i dont think it does that good of a job
updatetwo years in with continued regular use
despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me70 does have features that recommend it
using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches
something clipon would have been more useful
the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate
sturdy with adequate padding to protect my 34babies34
its a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars
i like that sharp thwack sound
oh well for once i got cheap
a good solid piece of equipment
good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind
its a decent pedal very solid
the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate
they either work or do not
also this model is xlr only
to me this makes it much easier when changing strings
i dont know which one is more accurate
im a little surprised at this one
still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased
it comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos
the finish on this product is very nice
i have had no problems with them at all
but for me tone is 80 of the equation
im pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model
this cable is really good for the price
the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life
dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal
nice quality at an unbelievable price point
but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the deans
will do the job until you find the one of your dreams
there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too
i bought these recently and i love them
your used to using big picks which strum hard easily
i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it
it does a fantastic job
behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most
a backward sustain pedal is not fun
it sounds good enough that i dont mind the lack of true bypass
this is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments
i would recommend having it around just for that
i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model
that doesnt make it worse or better just different
ive only used them once for backup vocals and the results were good
use them for home recording  nothing on the road
it make the process of replacing the strings so much faster
great for bending and awesome sound
the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam
i can bend the gstring easier than a super slinky
as long as the guitar is on it works great
it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more
also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands
thankfully i dont change strings too often
i am very impressed with how nice this strap is
but id expected more robust on your structure
after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning
but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more
slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable
i cant see how they could improve this at all
the base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory
for the price you cant go wrong
i mentioned that these are for inside playing
height adjustment was also important
sounds amazing in any combo
gls continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price
still there is no reason to fear trying these elixirs out
i have two of them
printed documentation is pretty lame but the included dvd is more through
love mine and have recommended to every musician i know
this holder may work well for harmonica for some people
its kinda small for my hand but it works great
its best on a stand 34 feet off the ground
you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock
you shouldnt have any problems
this product is exactly what they say it is
but thats not enough now a days
di am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however
there is so much in this little box
but then its only fifty bucks
the noise suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise
let me start of by saying this tuner is great
i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs
they are inexpensive and they work
take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy
although the others have more features i like this little pedal
wow i am very surprised by this pedal
i am glad i bought this
so i agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid
as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money
i like the soft sandy feel of these
assembled the stand in seconds
looks nice displayed in the corner of my office
and it also cuts the strings
great all round pick one of my favorites
i use this for my ipad
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them
i decided to conatct the on stage people directly
it just worked like the old one
in addition i couldnt use those on my acoustics
it would not seat properly and would slide out
it does however clip into the sound hole okay
i should have gone with schaller from the beginning
i am very impressed with this unit
this new ns triaction capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively
didnt purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review
theres no buzzing and it stays out of my way when im playing
looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought 2
it isnt shrilling or peaky at all
pros  they look very nice
full range achieved from 6 to noon
a must have for guitar teachers imho
they explore quite nicely that way
it has led lights to follow as well as a meter to use
its okay to soak the wood as long as its momentary
im sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me
009 string or 1st string was not in there
the sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing
what the hell is the plural of lexus
i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too
for the price cant beat it
this string is not muddy sounding like many flat wounds
this is a very versatile tuner
if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal
i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future
fortunately things have changed for the better
have had tons of compliments on the sound
the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise
my violins tone doesnt change much at all with this mute
this ranks right up there as the best money i ever spent on equipment
the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should
even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew
the item shipped in time
it feels solid looks like a real direct box
go ahead and buy it
the 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel
self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp a real nice feature
this box is small but packs a great punch
its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week
i find my left hand hitting the lever when im in open position
durable affordable easy to grasp and use
i have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon
everything you need to keep your guitar clean and polished and sexy
i ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great
you cant beat this for the price
you wont be disappointed at all
good quality material ensures i wont be needing another set for a long time
in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar
a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar
this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones
the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better
this strap is perfect for those needs
if you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board
this guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck
use this alot on all kinds of electronics
havent had an issue with any in the 45 months weve had them up
these stay in every case i own
it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound
the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop
i love the sound of this pedal
even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online
this is what i dont like about the other type of snark display
id rather just pretend that florida didnt exist
turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see
the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of 34regular34 cables
it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly
its perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up
if i lose it im buying another
ive been using this product for a while now
highly recommend the apogee jam
rugged reliable and simple to understand
very happy with this purchase
up to this point i havent been very impressed by solidstate technology
well made cable with bulletproof molded ts protection
i have more expensive cables but rather use these
this box does the trick
it gives just the right amount of crunch when needed
this is a black sponge for smaller mics
if it was a choice between the 2 the planet waves wins hands down
one of the better trems ive had the pleasure to use
theres a highpass filtertremendously useful when rumble is a problem
the design of this product is innovative and excellent
ill have them with me for spares
however now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless
the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new
the gray dunlops dont look anywhere near as cool as these
this stand holds up my ukulele so yay
dont recall if i purchased it on amazon
i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars
the red color is a metallic color  and i totally dig it
wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this
make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual
strings theyre all i use on my acoustic
i teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner
first a word about joyo
pt 9 is all i need
cant tell if its truly working on my maple wood ukulele
so far it has functioned well and i do use it a lot
i bought it to keep my fender strat in and it works great
ill be buying another one and trying it again
so bottom line im not impressed
there are a few issues however
if youre doing something similar to me im sure you will be too
its easy to set up and use
this is the first and only tc electronic product ive ever purchased
i might modify it for that
and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars
the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box
im seriously impressed with the quality
ill be buying and recommending these for a long time
the product works as advertised and amazon has the best deal
terrific allinone musthave tool for guitarists
so far this power supply is great
the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions
i have a 300 strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it
this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever
it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc
the adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever it does its job well
hard to beat at that price
but you cant ask for much more for the price of 399
you really cant go wrong for the money
so whats the behringer xenyx 502 like in this use scenario
i bought these for my little sister and she loves them
this capo cannot work with it
extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this
operates with one 3v 2032 battery included
so what are the presets
im looking to upgrade after a month
looks vintage but works great at a great price
the clarity is superb and the bass is awesome
heavy duty and rugged it should last forever
nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body
does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it
yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster
i have experimented with others but always come back to them
even came with a couple of velcro straps
wow i will never buy another sm57 again
i recommend for use of  1
everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well
i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings
this is one beefy string winder
i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value
the capos well made and doesnt show any manufacturing flaws at all
ive been buying cheap stands and im never really getting what i want
does not work for all guitars
i use harmonica holders for kazoos
anyway this thing sounds great
these are some of my favorites
i may try those next time on my les paul
they sound great and stay in tune well
good thing i had purchased the 9volt power adapter
i use the 21 cable
for 120 you get virtually every effect in the book
i still own most of these units except for this one
also used these for the tremolo back cover
ranging from a 12 musiciansfriend promotional item to a 200 rack mount
i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week
a great purchase and built like a tank
i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option
i will replace with 12s however
no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in
and i like it for starting out learning
it is a solid well built guitar
i finally concluded that there was no difference
i put it on my stratstyle guitar and it works brilliantly
have been using these for years now
it folds up so small and yet remains very stable in use
not much i can add to the review that isnt well covered already
i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal
they are all very well made
im updating a previous negative review
true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound
i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar
very versatile and built in boost feature is great too
great for beginners and experts
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design
only for indoor really light use
when they say mini they mean it
well be buying these for a long time to come
i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise
thats a lot cheaper than spending twentysomething dollars on an additional wall wart
do i fully understand how this works
my old bag had more
does it damage your instrument
great price for a carbon copy pedal
this comes complete with bridge saddles and full size block
this left me to the old plug and chug method
i also have a boss tu3 pedal tuner
the simplicity of this mic is very nice
after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand
ive played through the amp for a couple weeks now and its great
they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing
well thats not quite true
i heard more definition with the guitar
i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too
i just glued it to my pelvis
so why the new strap
it seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it
look no further these are great bags
it was what i had expected it to be
but why not use the best when i can
not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better
i have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars
behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality
i knew i had to go cheap at least for now
if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device
or the picture is a bit misleading
cheap price and cheap product
but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you
in fact i dont hear any interference at all even with a single coil
i grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed
i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes
on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing
ah you know im just so used to strings that are individually looped
it has a retro look and an old school sound perfect
sounds good and well worth the money
the pick pocket is a nice extra
the straps have petabs buckles and are easily adjusted
also there is no driver supplied by the company
this little stand collapses and sets up so easy
the neat freak in me hates that
this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage
they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets
all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra
i have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars
the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well
very well made of heavy metal framework
they are solid sound great and this packaging of them is excellent
that happens far less now
i would probably say it exceeds your expectations
i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine
if youre on the fence
fast fret  fast fingers
its all about money to them
if youre just starting out this guitar is perfect for you
these mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response
but these are as advertised
if it matters to you the white ends are very well white
i became relatively skilled at it in short time
man this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks
it is not expensive but the item is sort of cheap
granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist
check one out and youll want it
i have a mim 2012 strat every thing went together with out any issues
the ukelele   the ukelele looks and feels decent
ten bucks you cant go wrong
youll find it in this pedal
buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately
my use is relatively narrow  kick drums and amps
you get what you pay for
you really cant go wrong for the price
its a power adaptor so it isnt too exciting but it works fine
its definitely the best verb its price range
installed with no problems plays pretty well so far
these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily
im a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups
you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly
im an older guy who has been playing for approximately 50 years
i have never heard my guitar sound so good
i have to type more
it did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall
they sound nice and bright and they last a good while
i didnt even have to adjust it
the weight is great for my style of playing
they are easier to bend too which is great
the small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling
definitely  going back for more
the quality of the guitar is amazing
the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand
the sound is unbelievable especially at this price
i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tonesustain
this is pot metal as well which again is fine
a must to keep wood looking fresh
i am totally satisfied with the stand
you can hear the difference once it is used
bought one tried it on a pbass loved it
quite amazing especially for the price
good presentation and well packed
i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights
but for this price why bother
since hes 11 he doesnt have many opportunities to play with others
decent holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles
variety of acoustic sounds possible
all latch well and look good
normal plush fake fur inside with about 34 of soft foam all around
when this arrived i didnt realize it was that small
it takes up very little space the biggest plus
installed these fender locking tuners and voila
this is just what the doctor ordered
made me a little cautious
im glad i bought this product
i have tried it several times and it just doesnt tune right
the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges
it  weighs only 25 pounds 109kg so its portability is very good
these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are
this means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever
i am pleased with the strap and the low price
its easy to put on and take off and it does its job
dirt box gold for under 50 bucks
it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too
bought the focusrite unit instead
the same sound for a lot less money
good product and got good price here on amazon
always buy daddario strings for my 7 guitars
made in china it says
what can you say about a guitar chord
a little tough to get on
the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected
it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife
it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible
the primary use is for a laguna acoustic
tune in and check it out i think you will agree
this was a bit unexpected because of the bright label on the package
this item did the job its made for
the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box
it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well
but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer
other than that i totally recommend this microphone
it records what you sound like
i cant wait for us to do some mother and daughter electric guitar duets
i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good
it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident
the bullet style makes its easier to install
played for another few hours and they sound fantastic
its smaller and lighter than the snowflakemore diminutive than the picture would suggest
most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med
he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well
there may be a concern about damage to certain finish
i will not buy any other cable except planet waves
ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitars
this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly
it also protected my mic in a fall once too
they hold the strap on just fine
these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing
very good price and looks like they will last awhile
i found a stud  it works  looks fine
aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal
it just slides on the tip of the tripod
and its super easy to apply
this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight
his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use
it was cheap to buy but works just fine
overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great
runs on one cr 2032 pancake batteryincluded
the cheap china copies on ebay dont fit
it arrived well padded in a double box
my upgrades if any will be new pots caps wiring nut perhaps tuners
they sound good and are affordable
but for the price these are fine
i have been using these strings for a while now
that also means a bigger readout
noise reduction these are absolutely stellar at noise reduction
we tried to make the fendershallers work but just could not
much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before
it also worked perfectly on my roland rd300nx but i expected that
getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended
it is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet
i am pleased with this product
forget all the volume drop comments
over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made
34  how do you know if you have this finish
buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits
i have purchased several snarks of all different types
mine was shinynew and was an absolute perfect fit on my mexistrat
a three star at best
worked perfectly for my needs
this is of course via the front panel only
they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise
come on were artists so show off your creativity
this is a fairly good size cloth at that
but their intended purpose is to speed string changes
and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway
ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences
the strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable
does everything i want in a personal stage monitor
its totally silent very bright display sensitive meter
these seem a lot more stable than the 1046 i had been using
im glad i finally decided to get it
work perfectly with my guitar good price
if you mic up this will work for small gigs
durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack
they are small which takes getting used to though
my 66 had thin frets
its still a very nice guitar though
other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability
the mustang iv is the same as the iii but with 150watts
its a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection
the case is solid albeit plastic
this is a great buy
too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch
got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar
fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands
great vocal and guitar sounds
will not hold a blue yeti  yeti pro microphone
i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar
cant beat these 10 stands
the color stands out well on the black background
took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and restring the guitar
the more overtones an instrument produces the worse the tuner behaves
wow  they all come to life and make the amp sizzle
the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita
this delay is really nice especially for the price
imho you dont need a click switch
for the price im really happy
did it improve my life
out of the 4 i have it only liked 2
it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature
i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges
the sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less
for the price it does a very good job
that bright sound can last about 6 months or more
but this is a bargain and small
if you place it on your music sheet stand thats great
one has light strings  the other has medium
i like this a lot better than others that i have
i personally guarantee your satisfaction
what else is there to say
thats a subjective thing i suppose
this thing simply didnt work right out of the box
when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift
youtube these theres loads of videos
good product for a good price very comfortable
no big deal i just tune it at 12th fret
really just stupid powerful for 300
even a kid can use it with a guitar
i have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great
then again i never did really like tss
overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down
i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner
as you can imagine i need to practice a lot
i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass
it also fit my tele to
doesnt wotk with vamp 3
as well as mute on every channel
not sure i would buy these again
adjusts easily and holds its position
so far forget to use it but that will come
makes a great little practice amp
this is not my first guitar
everyone has their own preference and i just didnt like the feel of those
for these particular buttons i used a 18 drill bit for the pilot holes
the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp
it takes some skill to eq things to the point of normalcy
ive now secured it with tape so it should be ok
comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble
no problems with it at all
as others have noted there are other better capos out there
takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar
there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments
this pedal is a great delay pedal
the added features are also a plus
consider it overpriced or rather undermade
other than that im not quite sure what makes it specifically a 34ukulele tuner34
about half the size of a regular pick
ive been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone
mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit
i dont have the matching extension cabinet because i just dont need it
the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights
the tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes
you dont have to plug into it
definitely top notch if this is what you are after though
arrived as expected and as described
i paired them with the jj kt88s and these things just rock
im planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case
i might get another one for a backup
i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars
i just purchased an electricacoustic epiphone ukelele today for my chiropractor
what a great little stand
they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair
getting ready to make few ukes and it will tune them also
it works with ableton live 9 with no problems
these are great tuners and they look great
best quality than polytune  1 lighter and best switch
im sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a tingting
its just a little bit short for my taste
these are pretty soft inside and fit most astyles pretty well
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii
it came with savarez strings  not the best ive used but good
the only weak point is the somewhat thin mid cut toggle switch
never say no to free stuff
knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves
this makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices
the behringer headphone amp was only ok
that may have damaged a contact
this thing folds up so it is easy for storing
ive owned just about every muff
especially if you like to save your single strings for use
price very reasonable price for what they do
the screws strip out too easily
louder focused and projects much better  almost resonatorlike
these are excellent music stands
adjustment is easy and effective
works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch
the single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag
it seems like it is good quality
heres the thing i am an amateur
however ive purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less
it has the same 6 strings tuned the same way
these are really well made straps for the money
and when you attach the headphones it works great
it is well worth the 60 i paid for it
the other one was not bad i lasted probably 10 years
you can do partial capos with this one
im running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out
what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string
no metallic hiss youd normally expect
works well while other things are going on around you
i use it as a practice mic
helped a lot with vibrations in my apartment building
has 6 stringsfrom e to e
they dont play at all like what i was expecting
try them if its quality sound that youre looking for
just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last
it does it really well with very little to no noise
i find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things
once the input is active in software the light becomes green
better than i expect i going to order 2 more
i just ordered three different guitar straps online
a guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under 500
three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step
when i play faster songs thick gauge picks are very easy to lose
the optional carry bag is a must imho
this is exactly what i wanted
it arrived intact and ready to play
what is this amp exactly
i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy
in general is does tend to get a little noisy though
the tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great
but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too
its working for me ill be buying more for our studio
ordered 6 and out of 6 i have exactly zero flat washers
it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
beautiful sound for each of the different modes
they sound great and seem to last longer than other brands
i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic
i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time
the highest i feel comfortable tuning these to is e flat
the first issue is with thick straps
i replaced a bone noncompensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this
got this to put into my pseudocaster project guitar
4 stars because ive only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode
having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier
or even headphones that youd like to baby
it would just be nice if it included one is all
this pedal is outstanding for the price
this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it
no big deal at all
it has a good seal also
it sounded just as good as those other amps
never owned an ocd but i dont need to
also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aesthetic
all my guitars have these locks on them and im very satisfied
these are great  have 3 of them now
3 the jam has a gain meter ie an led and a gain control
books under the head stock
screw is actually two pieces wtf
ive used and own many tuners and brands
in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect
i hardly notice im actually wearing it
major fail on their part
025 width to the e string
i am really impressed with this mic
at 2000 this amp is a deal
what we have here is an xlr male to xlr female black cable
very pleased with this purchase
garbage if you like it
exposing the delicate printed circuit board
i havent tested it for recording purposes
this one serves the bill
i bought this pedal for the compression and sustain though and am very pleased
now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune
the action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up
easier learning bagpipes than these things
sorry os2  its pawnshop time for you
however the price was good
no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldnt handle the load
by the way the oldschool tweed look is a plus too
this stand does the trick
this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open
works great and base is out of your way
they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure
the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same
excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass
i bought two for 10 bucks each
my thick stock strings were killing my fingers
i have been using them for 10 years and have never seen one fail
the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges
if you have any vision problems the display might be an issue
after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself
octave  bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers
its not super heavy distortion though
it not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality
ok reviewing somethings i just dont see the need
vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers
and yeah new 4 strings do improve the sound on a 20 uke
the audio adapter is well built
ive had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years
so the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker
anyway these are great guitar picks if youre looking for something solid and longlasting
this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money
i bought i thought it was cool and different
but that means the guitar is very secure so i am very happy
it also allows you to knock the heck out of it
so far they are great
i bought this to 34daisychain34 two small kustom powered pa cabinets
this is my goto guitar
this will increase the life of your strings
it really does react to your playing style
i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment
it stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall
but thats not what guitars are for right
it has some fun effects
the effect is really great
who cares if it is plastic
does what its suppose to
output is not a problem if you are amplified
this is the american dj micro galaxian red  green laser
the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel
it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc
if you own a dot sheraton or a 335 you should buy this case
the body and buttons are plastic but solid they dont feel or look cheap
with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from
it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect
cant ask for much more in a tuner
no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more
so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound
it has a nice resonant sound good playability and very attractive finish
that speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product
my wah wah a morley power wah was almost useless with it
however compared to elixers the sound just isnt as 34full
i dont trust it and amazon has it way over priced
this just sounds so much fuller and more real
if amazon used halfstars i would have given them 355
i would buy another one without hesitation
lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action
sweet action durable and very affordable
for the money you cant beat this cable
it runs on electric so no need for batteries
tried everything i could but its gone
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2
i am happy with it
ive been playing guitar my entire life
sounds amazing in any combo
works perfectly for the purpose
i bought this for my sons 7th birthday
i hit the tone button and all that is done for me
i will buy another one of this
i thought i had found my pick
simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician
this fender mini guitar stand works great
but why go to all that trouble
just one bottle of this should last years and years
i now know what i was missing all those years of not having one
very nice quality of leather
it arrived earlier than i expected
why have to remember to carry spare batteries
i read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the rogue
it looks cool and sounds just fine and clear
yes i bought 3 and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass
no complaints at all for the price
i would try the fender
it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments
i would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar
also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun
i love having the colored cables makes set up so easy
for me these lightmedium are exactly where i want my strings to be
very happy and pleased with this one
so thats four broken strings in less than 20 hours play
as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built
this is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price
i havent swapped tubes or the speaker  its completely stock
the finish is beautiful and i found no defects
its amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electroacoustic guitar
my kids were excited to split this pack of picks
this case it built really well it has really nice plush interior
unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand
works well with my marshallhas a lot of feautures and is very versitale
with the wall wart no di hum  great
i think their pretty accurate
that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time
i imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing
its made pretty well for a plastic tool
works great and easy to use
it feels a bit cheap but then it is cheap
not only that i like the idea that its an us company
it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design
it will never hurt you it only helps
i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some
i was displeased with a somewhat poorquality strap i was using before
you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves
easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones
i have run both aroland rd300nx digital pianoandroland vcombo vr700
it comes with a mic stand holder thing
well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks
this portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone
although the strap ends are light plastic theyve held up well
as i said this isnt a knock of these strings
with that in mind its perfect
the black dunlop has a nice smooth finish
these cables are sturdy and sound clean
it attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar
they are what you order
and to be quite honest ive only been using the presets
but i bought this one and im glad a did
it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar
get this one and have no regrets
all set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe
for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesnt advertise
however i use it more as a frontend boost to my alreadyoverdriven bugera amp
we are using an mp3 player for backup
the shure sm57 sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board
this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric
these mic stands worked perfectly
inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners
i dont notice any difference in audio or loss in sound
rough handling will probably break it
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
these strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings
cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster
consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top
i love this tuner so much
works a little better at winding strings than the barebones winders
i dont know what else to say
and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo
this may not be so great for smaller amps
if you strum  play softly then pluck  tune each string softly
not bad for the price they have it for
i couldnt even get the software to load on my 2013 imac
the springs are almost always missing
i always recommend all kyser capos
i changed this for a tc electronic polytune
good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly
this makes a great gift item
this is really quite a fantastic little gizmo
these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look
for me thia is the best cables ever
it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar
guess ill have to stop eating cheetos while im playing  just kidding
i like the gripping surface
it has a rich full bodied sound
not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze
it is so soft and comfortable
need a all n one tuner buy this or an iphone
a pop filter is essential
ordered this and two cables
i use the 15 mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years
one is its height adjustable and two is the tilting head
it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up
what is there to say
i am finally feedback free
i thought i had chosen a different capo
this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot
this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
i have to rethink the way i use fx in this box
i havent had any problems with them at all so far
but if you want something that is 90 close well this is it
theyre holding up very well
this wah pedal just doesnt cut it
this product seems to be a pretty good product
im happy with this product
suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment
for 35 or so im not going to complain
if its an instrument the sm57 delivers
this is a great effect
long lasting made with quality
cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another
sturdy and a bit weighty
go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing
ill probably have to breakdown and pay 100 for a real strap
quite sure its the same model
all in all though very good for the price
theyre made in the usa
i also find it very accurate
plus the tweed look really grows on you
this is such a lifesaver or an effort saver
simply the best picks ever for bass
with the gain at halfway you get great addc crunch
my transmitter pack slid on with ease and i was ready to go
this was was better then i expected
i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the athm50
nothing fancy and not for everyone
bought this cover to go with behringer mic
great heavy picks amazingly cheap price
great at this price too buy several
good quality cable and price
nope it isnt leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff
they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while
what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand
it appears a little thinner than the original and just doesnt look as 34original34
packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use
firstly let me address the 34adjustable backrest34
very solid and i feel comfortable hanging my taylor 414ce in this
they do what they are suppose to do and do it well
folds up and sets up comfortably and easily
not much else to say about it  it polishes my guitar very nicely
works well for a multitool
also they are offered at 40 or 50 so its simply a better value
i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome
bottom line you get what you pay for
it also came with a cord
it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many
i feel it sounds really good and has many settings
the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards thats well known
with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised
and control sound and volume at your fingertips
it drains batteries almost overnight
promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure57 stays in one place
the keys were of course inside the case
this is a hitormiss product
not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge
it was my favorite capo
but it can also my blueridge br180 or my seagull s6 coastal spruce
keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board
and a previous reviewer said his dot with bigsby fits
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
i feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones
which in the end is my concern
i would buy them again
i am buying more gauges too
im quite happy with any of the on stage brand stuff i have
rhythmic u2 delays are usually around 350450 ms
i like medium picks and this feels comfortable
caps are marked 223k so looking that up they are 0022uf
this is exactly what i was hoping for
well i guess it works
black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay
they do what theyre supposed to do
it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars
removes those annoying popping ps out of your recordings
they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them
with ten packs it will likely be a while before i do so
a lot of which do not sound to digital
go and buy the dunlop nylon
your h2 wont die during recording because the batteries give out
the snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me
hard to believe this was so bad
the builtin metronome doesnt have a lot of volume but its clearly visible
very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal
the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from
mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are
they turn out to be great
they did what i expected them to do
but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
id like to know the markup
very cheaply made but does the job
thats why i say this is the best on the world
the only thing missing is a remote
it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen
leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is
last distortion pedal youll ever need
for the price i got a little more than expected
its cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much
thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob
says its easier to use than the smaller cloths weve gotten before
it does a good job for the price
they will last forever if you take care of them
i really dont know what else to say about them
im on the fence with this product
great little amp but get a tube amp if youre serious about playing guitar
this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away
all my guitars have piezo bridges
this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 14 instrument ins
its not very compact when folded but im still giving it 5 stars
std power supply a plus
these are nice and bright
its a good quality case
it makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy
for a cheap eq it does great
convenient storage is its biggest plus
i like them but i love the schaller locks more
in the end the real difference was the price
i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated
but i have to say its well worth the price
fits all standard mike stands
built to last and it is a shure
there are also output adjustments as well
clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price
2 its very sturdyan oftennoted feature of boss pedals
every microphone has it uses
the cry baby has proven itself since the 60s
matches perfectly with other boss pedals
however the sd1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility
i like the dunlops feel grip and durability
it holds incredible its not coming out now for sure
easy to use and handy for any string instruments
it has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents
over the past couple of months ive been replacing guitar straps
my little  vht special 6 came alive with this speaker
and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound
comes with big beefy drywall anchors and feels just right
i am very pleased with the price and the quality
that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting
this is not a toy
this was a great purchase
yes its a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound
not so  it was made heavier and nicer
the first arms the track the second begins the recording
these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock
can be upgraded in time if you choose
i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear
enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves
im sold out on joyo pedals
the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes
just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it
these cables are no different
i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individuals needs
seriously this is a great pedal
given to sister from mysel
then connect output of the ditto to the amp
good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly
it picks up anything it is attached to
this is a good durable mount
over all though this is great for lightly distorted  edge of distorted sounds
i can buy an adapter with onoff switch for microphone
after putting in new pegs and restringing with these strings
youd be better off with a similarlypriced smalldiaphragm condenser and a windscreen
there isnt too much to say about it
it also folds down pretty well
once down you can pretty much count on an almost perment mounting
soooo its pretty much useless to me
the stereo out is very cool for using two amps
i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings
super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables
the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds
great performance sub par construction
otherwise its a good option at a good price
was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised
love the colors and the price cant be beat
it is not something you are going to understand at first
just another 20 output would make these 5 stars perfect
fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off
this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own
at first i played it with my line 6 15 watt amp
they also wont mark up your prized instrument
love the sound it produces
makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally
with these pins the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it
its lightweight but very stable even with a heavy bass drum mic
how far wrong can you go for 183
im not sure id use it for professional gigs but great for home use
they are clean cut smooth finish
small diameter gives it a shrill overtone
i paid 10 dollars for this
quality strings at a very affordable price
i would have preferred something different
no problems with slipping and tuning
may order more as extras
probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs
when i plugged into the hot tubes i was surprised but immediately intrigued
it does what it should do
i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker
theyre all full of crap you dont need
either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment
while i wish the bases came in different colors i really like these hangars
a note about the mixed reviews
for me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz
its almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing
it is built like a baton
they sound just as good as they did a year ago
get a mxr custom badass 78 distortion
restringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread
otherwise these are a good value with easy on  off
so i just ordered another one of these
what these picks are good for is leads
no buzz andor other noises noted
this does the trick just fine
for 10 bucks this is great very sturdy and reliable
i read great reviews here and the price seemed good
as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price
grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack
anyway i ended up keeping the guitar a jackson dk2m
someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender
but how does it perform
with accessories tonal quality is typically important
all in all it was a good upgrade and id do it again
i am a future m audio customer from here on
i like it a lot
the bassman is another that is just off the charts good
cant say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad
free shipping gotta like thatcons  only one power setting 15v
first the good   this instrument is a good beginner piece
second is holding its own
using cheaply made cables could affect your sound  you can loose top end
too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever
some people rate this above the snark devices but i cannot
this one is the best ive tried so far
works great with my baritone ukulele
i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements
then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town
my guitar room isnt super bright and its very difficult to read
i just think it could have been better designed
it leans wayyy too far back
i just ordered mine two weeks ago
well constructed durable built to last
when i tried it at the shop it sounded great
nice to use to muse your violin
a very attrative complete assemblage of blues harp
another tip   get a copy of yamahas sound reinforcement handbook
or any combo little amp
this pedal is no exception
i would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black
the only problem is that the effect wears off quickly
the spring tension is just right
behringer products are good for the semipro
for ten bucks you cant go wrong
you might only have 3fx left
the truth is they will work on anything
also some roomspashosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument
because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5
the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head
its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass
nice materials and i think it will be durable
a great addition to an already great amp
the tone knob does nothing
didnt know until i sampled quiet a few
and whats up with the tuning thing
these went on with no problems
it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components
ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound
if used correctly this mute works well
i hadnt played any of my string instruments for some time
also they werent as large as i expected
i used to have trouble holding on to picks
they do what theyre supposed to do
id give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial
i mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is
does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive
we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent
some of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic
they also seem to make a good clean sound
so choose whichever color you prefer and go for it
i think i already mentioned something about it being sturdy
my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks
here is a comparison of the jp02 chameleon and the onespot
so for the price these are an excellent value
i love the dunlop formula 65 polish and cleaner
i use these light guage strings because i have arthritis
check out the pictures ive posted
i am user that likes behringer products
many adjustments to get just the right position
guitars at that price may be twice the cost
probably better than any other light strings ive bought
was really impressed to see it in action
you can program it to whatever midi values you want
this is my third circuit breaker cable
this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get
hard to beat it as far as leather straps go
the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now
grab a set you wont be disappointed
all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable
we all have our preferences but im not an ernie ball fan
others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys
i would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well
good deal on this package of patch cords
i might try out the 28strand next year
there are people who are comparing this to the shure sm57 and other microphones
i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter
it sounds great with little of its own noise
the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me
i gave it 4 stars because it hasnt been maintenance free
update  july 8 2012
the best replacement for fender tuners by far
it is a great buy though considering the price
these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well
this is a nice cable
will defiantly be buying more
i brought my baggs para acoustic di and i was glad i did
even then you wont get a great clean tone
and now my personal debate continues
removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort
you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music
constructionwise these are likely lifetime cables
but they last a long time and sound great
i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome
just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned
d one love fender mustang you rock
other than that great picks
thanks amazon for this product sale
its finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head
update   i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx 802
came with more parts than what were required
i have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for squiers
i love this guitar string winder
would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
although not through amazoncom i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar
no more hunting for picks anymore
im a procheapo and i hated this thing
solid state just isnt the same
this capo looks great and does the job
and it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my ta50r
i dont have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers
i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at homeand this works great
this is a great capo from shubb
all in all this is a great guitar strap
i use this cable a lot and it has stood the test of time
that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive
the rest will just play as if the effect was off
i was looking for a financially good deal
the only thing the other has on this one is its size
it fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle
it runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9volt power supply
all in all im very pleased with the dg ghss
for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height
first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying
which brings me to another minor complaint  no linux drivers included
try reversing it and youll see what i mean
i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats
top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon
sadly the volume only goes to 10
these are easy to install and simple to use
the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets
my pet use to roam the car while driving
angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well
may not for very big guitar neck
im a beginner so im not very picky on the accessories yet
when i take the batteries out no problem
no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there
it works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas
the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guidescovers and provide good strain relief
any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability
ive got another one on one of my banjos
they also have pretty colors
both arrived together and at the expected delivery date
it was not dropped or abused in any way
im using this with an ovation balladeer
bottom line  inexpensive wellmade accurate timesaving
the yeti sounds as good
it would be nice if there was a sound feature
this one is too slow for the stage
i purchased this before i have ever changed a string
im not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish
they work in a variety of applications metal hard rock jazz blues reggae etc
plus its fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas
i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk
which is good if you are as clumsy as i am
all in all 4 stars
all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort
my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great
i highly recommend these for around the house use
this is very ruggedly made i think it will last for ever
great price for a simple strap at around 5
so ill try to give you the information you need to make your purchase
i only wish it came with two of them
if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner
the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence
this should do well for you
uses a 9v battery or power supply
this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured
i doubt there is that much difference
im very pleased with it
its a switchless pedal that i put through hell
the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material
the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch
this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition
nifty little item that does what its designed to do
it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument
mounting holes are drilled right screws pass right through and fit perfectly
they break down faster than id like
this is a pretty good nonexpensive capo
it looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas
i cant wait to get it through my other amps
and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height
the typical clipon tuner has an lcd needle
in fact i like it so well
i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar
this pedal does exactly what my title suggests
microphone works well for acoustic guitars
easy to use very tight and doesnt get in the way
based on those criteria the digitech cm2 is perfect
super sturdy easy to put intake out
no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck
for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok
i did have to sand to make it fit
would buy again if given the circumstance
ive had the digitech xseries multidelay for many years
good leather good build made to last  and age nicely
wish they had put that in some instructions
a nice little amp to rock out with
for most singers it will be just what they need
sound great play great feel great tune great
i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound
youll need to buy an xlr cable on your own
by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little
its chromatic so it will tune anything
i may buy some more of them
he can create jamclick tracks and play along
silent onoff and i have two of them
this tuner really delivers its inexpensive and accurate  much better than the sn1
the attack heads that i bought though are single ply
this nylon pick has great play feel
but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction
would not hesitate to purchase this item
it is easy to hold and is a good product
this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar
right now its a mere 45
they work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips
the planet waves capo definitely gives the kyser a run for its money
the reproduction of the sound was very good
and the pockets  oh the pockets
plus behringer is the best brand for pedals
and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in
it is very easy to use
quiet  much quieter than other compressors in this price range
i still prefer these 100 over other strings though
i have a yamaha f335 i really like
amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs
it is doing exactly what i expected and much more
it works perfect with cakewalk music creator 5 and a digitech vocalist
can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 23 hours
and it is the best bet for the money
seems to be sturdy and well built
i almost sent them back
relatively small but is a secure
i plan to buy more of these in the near future
in practical terms no not for this sort of item
monster cables are well constructed
i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal
i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer
i recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand
maybe 5 times in my entire career
all in all it was worth the money
other than that it is what it is and does what it says
so i sent it back
spring for the extra bucks and be happy
these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets
at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds
very sturdy and awesome pop filter
using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet
if you use ext mic
cord is long enough 6con build quality is slightly less than the fc4
one of the cheapest prices on amazon
for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install
you can read my review on that item
its a great buy in my opinion
ill use a stand if im going to use a guitar often
i wanted to test for myself
it could be thicker  it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up
my only complaint with this device is the battery connector
it was far better than i expected
this tuner the snark fits on my godins small headstock with no problems
this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look
this is a great cable at a good price
perfect size and does its job
they have a nice textured grip
this amp probably is not for you
may buy another for a spare
unit works fine with my digital piano
i have installed a set i got 8 and it sounds really good
when it arrived the volume pot was not working
in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent
i dont need to use them myself
the ac adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness
they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference
for the money i figured why not
this has got to be heard to be believed
the goods are up to scratch and fit properly
im using it with a fender eightyfive solid state amp
this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it
it just sounds heavier tighter and more articulate
only on first 4 strings may be
i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking
for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this
to the point where its nonexistent
the dobro had the issue with the strap didnt have a great connector
there is also a 14 line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment
i would buy more if i needed them
1 star off for not looking like the higest quality
easy to operate easy to read
the stand is worth the price and more
they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout
ive used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces
often we get what we pay for
for the price this is a steal
even without a boost i can use it for death metal
it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle
works great with my on stage keyboard stand
under windows 7 all i had to do is plug it in
tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies
of course none of this means i will stop buying od pedals
i have been playing guitar for longer than i care to admit
it also has a substantial treble boostlow cut going on
its comfortable and adequately strong
mine broke and so did my friends
works fine with any guitar
i can live with that
my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a nobrainer
i found one of these used for half the retail price
it is not that long but no complaints
the strap that came with it is no great shakes either
ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly
blues blues slide rock metal
as the title says it works
the only thing i would do to improve is add an off button
the price is great too
this is a great product at a good price
i tested the microphone on a phone call using google voice
ive compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and its dead accurate
i cant believe these were actually sent to me
but for average boards they work great
these have not rusted so far
5 stars in my book more if theyd allow that
this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting
affordable accurate and they dont fall off your knee all the time lol
im sure the screws are okay but i wouldnt trust them myself
so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed
while the delay is surprisingly good you cant customize it
awesome for chord based songs
you cant beat the price for such a great little tuner
this is perfect for our digital piano
i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it
you might find that youre a convert within seconds
i havent tried this through a pa live yet
is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence
great overdrivedistortion for classic rock music
not much i can say about a standard mic stand
so it was time to get a real wah
cons tuners may or may not slip when playing hard
however at amazons current value price for this particular monster cable its a nobrainer
this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail
only the machine heads are somewhat smaller
i couldnt be happier with these items especially the ovation idea
the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich
just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord
i really like this cable
it was my backup amp for a qsc gx5
in my opinion daddario is the standard by which all other strings are measured
also was the last to pick it up for 11850 shipped to my door
for general home use though i wouldnt worry about it too much though
usually they are too small
but it was always awkward
this beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job
it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it
minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some bright strong mids
i dont miss the amp at all
i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting
dont let the size fool you
i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar
this one really appealed to my son because of the front design
the exp16s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic
or so their packaging claims
fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short
but just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet
id feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup
it only took me about half an hour
grip is the last thing you want on your strings
but i had serious questions about the classic rock amplug
overall i think this unit is a great value for the money
awesome patch cables for your pedalboard
no complaints with this outfit
i wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that
acoustic and electric but not at the same time
what makes these a bargain is construction
mics i have tried yet
i wanted to try these since the under 5 price is good
also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical
for 2400 this compressor does just what its supposed to do
in the beginning i had problems
i ended up using that pick for something like 3 years playing 12 timeswk
honestly this looks really sharp put together
this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance
now get out thereand play your heart out
the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges
it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars
34 then by all means knock yourself out
i dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine
i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin
it wasnt even a little bit sharp
even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud
the amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior
give these picks three days and youllnever go back to another style
somehow i had gravitated over to other brands including martin and daddario
if you need a beater this is it
keep a couple of these in the bag as spares
this amp is small in size but full of sound
the ultimate guitar cleaning tool i love love love this kit
this takes a second to get use to
like all of dunlop products this worked great
sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune
especially for the price this is a great buy
last week 4813 one of them wouldnt power up all the way
so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not
had a few packs of these from christmas
i do recommend this one
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price
would like to see stereo output options in future models
making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable
i think they are worth the premium price
anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this
its metal and it works
the fact that it does not have an onoff switch is a minus
perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size
this custom gauge set plays great
great for all your needs
i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles
with the ipad this isnt as noticeable
the neck has to be thinner though
me not so muchill just leave it hang
so i cant speak to really heavy use of the product
ieutf8psc1 planet waves patch cables theyre listed at
it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box
these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips
they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store
the case is better padded than i might have expected for the price
the file is saved and then you can push playpause to listen back
that was several months ago
i think it almost doubled in price a week after i ordered
its cheapit worx what more to say
just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal
perfect for ibanez guitars with special tuning
these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive
and then the less than good
so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar
id give this 1 and a half stars if i could
i bought this one to replace a shure 8900
ive used this for about 3 months now
i use it often but find it is not very accurate
its choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me
the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels
im going to be honest i have a cheap guitar
goes to show how diverse they are
i love the fit and the sound quality
right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones
my son loves them both
get a few rolls as a meter doesnt go as far as youd think
its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro
they had a rough feel and were stiff
cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke
i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply
in fact it works really nice
this one is also super accurate and allows you to really finetune your instrument
the guitar stays in tune while playing
great strings with a good feel to them
an experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me
what you should know about this pedal
keeping the pick clean and dry does help
i truly recommend it as a tuner pedal
i also think the price is pretty fair
a strap is a strap what can you really say about it
this is an overpriced item
some of them have good quality both in make and sound
mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use
never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion
also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle
fit finish feel and action were all very nice
works well for my needs
the sound is great and it is easy to play
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron
when unplugging it just be careful and itll last a lot longer
frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb
try to practice for about an hour daily
ive never had a problem and i wouldnt buy anything else
i feel like i might accidently break it off if im not too careful
are hard to beat when it comes to durability
i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased
there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall
love the reverb in the fx section
i want them to be slick when i bend notes
let me say three feet is short very short
i am self taught guitar for about 15 months
at these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments
and a hint  some pedals like behringer have a rubber bottom
these do that much better than schallers and the fender ripoffs of schaller
finally do not drop these
it was incredibly easy to install
i returned this because i wanted the script version instead
this set of strings is fantastic
finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it
this was exactly what i was expecting
it seems to work okay for that
for the price this is amazing
dont believe this is what it is meant for
they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager
for those of us who find acoustic guitars difficult to play this is solution
it plays great  great fret job and solid tone
the boss me70 is easy to use
other then that nothing id change
the cases you get now could be made by a different company
it fits well close well protects well transport well
you could do something similar on the x3live
fits mxl cube mics perfectly
easy to install and have never failed me
the price is right as well
get it if youre on a budget
when you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost
constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp
i feel like they should name it the 34pedal porch34
if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route
it has a switch for zerolatency monitoring of whatever is coming in
haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks
excellent classic rock and lead tones
the sound is very forward i would say harsh
im pretty fond of this little guy
at first thought it was broken but batteries were  not sitting in right
it doesnt come with a foot switch
it gets in the way and is hard to stay stretched out
they last for a real long time
the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well
solid construction and the mounting just works
i got exactly what i expected
once installed they are fantastic
my wife made me try this for a gig we had
along with a few high end guitars i also have a few beaters
one out of 7 arrived doa and another has failed since
it is still like new
i was skeptical about this 34impossible to drop34 thing which i read
hohner has been around forever well constructed instrument and very reliable company
but dont let the pocket be the selling point
that is not the case
i would look for something else if i didnt already have this
im glad i tried these i wont order them again
it has a nice metal case for storagetravel
for the price this stand cant be beat
this is a great stand
these are also easily removed if they bother you
this stand feel sturdy and strong
i used the bridge pieces on one guitar and the block on another
im happy with this purchase
i would recommend it to anyone
windows 7 didnt need to install any driversit was plug n play
always high quality for a reasonable price
very solid clasps one of which locks
the value of this amp is amazing
my guitar now stays in tune better than my prs and epiphone
this guitar just got stolen from me
but i should have known that going into a 6 double right ended cable
i couldnt get it to sound like i wanted it to
i only needed one string but it works fine
sound is about what you would expect
besides the volume these differences werent huge
they play and sound softer
its a good one for beginers like myself
even the pop filter fell off
as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down
it assembles quickly and easily and folds up into a nice package for transport
the feel of suede is hard to beat
i love this wall hanging mount
for the cost you cant beat it
this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter
the fender medium is my second choice for picks
i shall probably order more from this company in the future
i like it so much that i ordered three more
have to try them more and with other amps
i like ernie ball strings
you could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed
if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation
the answer is it gets 4 stars
it does not come with a mic clip
then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub
it has no trouble amplifying a turntables signal to line level
and it looks great too
simply slide it into position
they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks
yes because i usually have spares
they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect
i love this microphone stand
these are the only strings i use on my acousticelectric
this is a nice little tuner
ernie ball 2223 super slinky electric strings
i know others love them so i guess its just a personal thing
i love this little tuner
nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar
i have not used any lock system thats perfect
if not for that id have rated 4 stars
i have no desire to buy any other brand
i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened
the padding is good and soft
i ordered spare batteries but havent needed to change one yet
not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic
ah the folly of youth
but others know exactly what i mean
i also wish it was an xlr connection
got this for a 15 year old learning guitar
i tried different basses with it
these take less room  and cut down on the clutter
buy one  youll like it
thus far i am very pleased
this is a great pedal to put at the end of your fx chain
i would still recommend it though
the guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
i like the feel and texture of these 34pics34
using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic
if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done
might even get a blue mic
i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge
not the smoothest operation in the world but its gigbag small and accurate
you can never go wrong with real fender parts
they cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers
it doesnt obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner
im a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars
and i got a string cleaner by fender
and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly
this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke
tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp
they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks
i cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it
this was something i had to pick up simply due to the price
comes with the screws and the 34cotton34 washers so you dont scratch the body
no fuss no muss no fooling around
this pedal works but doesnt have the depth of echo i expected
simply put its well made and works great
the sound is very good
nylon has incredible strength but isnt very comfortable
for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules
they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice
this also has a bolt on neck
just dont get water on the wood
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another
bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law
this seemed perfect and it is
plus the humbuzz is so loud you cant hear anything from the microphone
im very satisfied with the performance of the cm2
so expect it to be a different color than what you order
my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning
i have not had that problem with this one so its another plus
im not really a corksniffer re  guitar tone
i also love the daddario make
no effects loop means that your timebased effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy
however there is 1 con to this wonderful instrument
yea it was coming from vegas to ny but 10 days
not sure about longterm durability or signal lossinterference
i wish id bought it long ago
your loop can be as long as 10 minutes with unlimited overdubbing
reaper had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel asio
but it works fine for me
i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound
dont panic strings marked adfb can be used just fine for gcea tuning
however it worked fine and gets the job done
even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing
but it doesnt just read the letter of the note your on
instability incompatability and frustration abound with audio interfaces
i am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases
i ordered this for my jackson dkmg
if youre considering it buy it
this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price
but you must be careful
i have always liked daddarios packaging
i noticed the difference on guitar
buy this and enjoy it
for this price it is a do not recommend for me
be prepared to purchase these in tandem
after using daddario strings ive try to ernie ball strings
sounds like and plays like a les paul
seriously a 2db shelf in the highs
puts on a good shine for your instrument
its not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily
moment from time to time  more falls into place
things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke
yup its ok  nothing special
i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems
i just got this uke today
this is a must if you have any of the danelectrofab pedals
same made in china product with another no name logo stuck to it
but lets quest after some serious bigleague sound
so its kind of like double trouble
they are the leader in new technology of strings
the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic
yes its casing is plastic but quite sturdy
once youve got them in or attempted to do so theyre never coming out
took me a while to figure that last one out
none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon
a must have for the yamaha pa130
just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it
the cable clips are a nice touch
amazonhas placed it there as a public service
planet waves makes good stuff
has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo
i taught myself to play on this
this bridge has more strength and solidness than the original
who cares so long as it sounds this good
it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch
this was a great investment for my home studio
youll either love it or hate it
i dont think that many people would do this
strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in
if you try them just make sure to give them time
for years i have fell more and more in love with my yamaha cgx111sc
its ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected
what can i say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place
depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes
hosa makes some other products that have good value
going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate
but i hope then would run on batteries next time
i havent noticed any sound issues at all
typical plastic durable and looks good
it does its job and does it ok for my taste
ehso for the pricehighly recommended
like i said theyre nothing fancy but they get the job done
i cant believe this mic is that good
dont worry about the 34thing34 hanging inbetween your strings
i use a onespot plug to power it
i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has
see my other review for the world tour gs1 folding tripod guitar stand
hey if it makes our son happy so be it
right so look for accesories and cablescords
i wonder how i ever lived without it before
sold great quality xlr mic
not to mention the bargain basement price
this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components
yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right
all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in
does lengthen the strap a bit but works
i am not calling him or her out or anything
its not multihundred dollar instrument but for kids and beginners its a good deal
it felt really small at first and i kinda was dissapointed
assembly was pretty easy and took little time
it doesnt sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine
it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings
the installation takes 2 minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play
it stays in place beautifully
i adore the sound of this unit
it is loud and the screen is easy to see
with this set up the second channel will distort a bit
but i stomp on it regularly
kudos to tascam for making such good headphones
overall i love this pedal at under 60 bucks
i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars
i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put
the sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get
i like that this one shuts off automatically
he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel
it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase
ive used all the roland cubes that are battery powered
i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one
havent tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too
i had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short
only with your guitar volume knob
the hplp switchshifting into hp is almost like a gain boost
if you use strings you should buy them your damn self
the only solid white leather strap i could find that didnt have any ornamentation
accidental turnon in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem
if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference
nice pics that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
it sounds good on my guitar and its not that expensive
this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great
i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes
it also has a different switch than the sm58
now that ive learned how best to use it ill keep it
the quality of this mic is just ok
i feel chained to my workstation
it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length
its not bad or anything just different
the korg is the perfecttuner
i recommend this to all musicians
these cables are good xlr noisefree cables
my stomach doesnt feel wrenched anymore
to my surprise i hear radio noises
so you can wind and unwind
this is the best usb microphone out for under 100 bucks
the korgstyle dialin reverb controls are easy but extremely limited
our tips  cd sales have gone way up
some sound best with 8020s
i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythmlead work is required
this case was not intended for the emperor ii
would have received a 5star rating had it been in a metal enclosure
its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use
i cant play real guitars
works great  great price  meets my requirements perfectly
it works well for its stated purpose and appears to be of high quality
so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution
buy it you will never regret
i surely will continue to experiment
hundreds of sounds to choose from
i have small hands and had no problem playing it
i loved it right out of the box
i have a dot studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly
if you dont know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack
i play a taylor 414ce
if you wanna be that one fat hawaiian guy israel kamakawiwoole go for it
if you cant make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech
for 10  which is also half the price at your local guitar shops
i have an esp eclipse
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars
my take on it your mileage may vary
reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some
this is a greatsounding reverb pedal
wish it came in a darker grain of wood
the plugs are also of the highest quality
although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars
im 62 and weigh 225
hosa products are a good bang for the buck
and they were right about that
these pick are cutting edge
this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe
so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio
works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power
i use these on my fender strat and they sound great
not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob
it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin
noise gate used to be always available
good trees for the price
but most on these things leak anyway
ive also got over a dozen capos dont ask
even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same
it was priced right  750 usd
i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough
can slide and play much smoother with this
so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand
heavy to travel with also so i dont know how much ill use it
the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief
dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive
i prefer 12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands
the pots look really good
looks great feels great and works great
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store
one thing thats less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself
its a great price and its definitely worth the investment
yeah i know  never heard of it
this is more of a toy than a good pickup
at least for a few weeks
its a tad pricey but all in all well worth it
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others
these strings have great tone and feel
ive been using this item for about 3 weeks now and i love it
i would not get these again in this size
i like the old version more
leaves board clean and fast
10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp
the set screw fell out and could not be found
the leather is thick and supple
no feedback or buzz from it
push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep
not a pretty product but good stuff
proper vibrato comes from the fingers
nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style
does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal
the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable
i like a flexible pick and these at
that said i find it useful for composing on the road
lots of bang for the buck here
i just cant trust it
4 be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself
the perfect wall mount for a ukulele
which you may find here dunlop ergo pickholder
could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box
compared to elixirs these are a bit brighter with good feel
the clean side of the amp is exactly that  very very clean
this chromatic clipon tuner is the best of the best
one can find info about mandolin setup on the web
the screen pops out easily but it will pop back in
if your a musician or want to be
my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale
love their xlr microphone cables too
i assure you its crapware and beware
my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try
it works great and makes this unit portable
built in tuner works great
these are great strings for such a rare instrument
amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too
the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance
i purchased these to replace the springs on my usa standard stratocaster
time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick
just too digital and uninspiring
if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing
i do recommend some snap locks for it though
it is my first pedal of any sort
purchased a pack for my playing buddy
i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great
it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune
it sturdy and good quality
these are amazing little inexpensive mixers
update  1912 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand
we always have to go and retune it which can be frustrating
this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style
its extremely wellbuilt and performs its task very well
i had it up and running in a few minutes
so you just record as quietly as you can
this is a very sturdy and wellmade bag
i think this is a good deal
you have to be committed to dealy
then to my surprise the squier strat was delivered yesterday
so for that many kind of modes barely useful
it holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments
mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue
this mixer is just what ive been looking for
i highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others
stays in place well and is very convenient
remove these rubber 34nonskid34 plates because they come off too easily
but this mini tuner is just plain amazing
awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone
this chorus is just about right
they are comfortable too as far as ear pads go
i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it
i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family
bottom line for gigging probably go with the 100s
i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust
they now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar
i purchased this model for home usenot for a kids backpack
they might actually be the same stand under different names
the ac3 does that job
i have used daddario for a number of years
i purchased 2 of this set and it works great
schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap
the delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound
it sounds great clean or dirty
and by similar i mean clip on
it has a nice big pedal for big feet
i bought a ukulele  to give as a present
what else do you want it to do
i bought an rp1 and it sounds much better
the downside is it is not granular enough to say intonate an instruments bridge
its all about personal preference so
i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off
good strap very comfortable and strong
such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy
then later used a boss tu12 for years
plugs directly to the system or my miniamp
it is great and i kinda like the great look
my tone knob has never been more useful
now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out
i have to say that i love the strings
it comes with two buttons two washers and 4 screws two different sizes
also the edirol r09 is the darling of the moment
the only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming
adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar
ive used both the es57 and es58 for several years now
its a fair quality ultra cheap cable
this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment
keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag
any size wuhan china sounds great
these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality
to say that they did less wouldve gotten the 1 star
i use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics
for the price its amazing
sound was good and it was easy to set up
there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches
fender really got close with the modeling
nowhere is it mentioned there wouldnt be any or i could have ordered one
this item is definitely in the good quality family
makes the strings nice and easy to fly over
sound is like its real big brother
i cant honestly say its a toy but it reeks beginner instrument
still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer
not a big knock actually
if theres a sale ill buy some more
i wouldnt perform with it but great for personal use
cords are cords but these are very nice packaged great good deal instant turnaround
guitar is my primary instrument and i am a decent singer but not great
that said do it wrong and plunk
this is what i came to
i switch acoustic strings 34 times a month on my 2 main guitars
bought this strap for use with my dean evo electric
there really is no midi support
and at 5 why wouldnt you give them a shot
does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar
its a very worthwhile purchase
usb with this shockmount as well as the at2020 usb and xlr version
like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds1
this is a decent pop filter
when it boils down to it i prefer my old planet waves tuner
press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing
but very good for a bag
get 2 amps and split the signal even
this is simply the ideal
not too difficult to get the hang of
i would have no issue gigging with this unit
when i did this it completely shut out the hiss
good construction and easy to put together
i installed this saddle in my silvertone sd10
great pedal and amazing value
gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick
hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks
this is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed
same setup same hardware etc and one person can have wildly differing results
they are made by taylor and all taylor guitars come with elixir strings
however i had problems at first until i made some changes
its even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks
i play in small tight places
very smooth and lasted me a while
standard built like a tank boss construction is renowned for
im sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop
this item does not work and is a total waste of money
they always give me consistent results
i normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal
i have two other fuzzsswollen pickle  mxr 108 classic fuzz
love it and wouldnt wanna part with it
everyone who sees it loves it
i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product
for that 5 stars easy
i use it with a vht special 6
that means you get one position
this snark will tune about anything
for under 20 these little tuner is all you need
remember this amp is not for metal
good locks i like them better then the dunlops
it does work but the stuff i used to have was much better
plenty for classic rock and blues
i recommend these picks without reservation
used on my acoustic guitar
as far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it
oh did i mention this is a very good looking guitar
if you dont like it get a refund
if it doesnt take batteries thats fine but give me an adapter
all in all a good value for the money
its got some solid pres and has enough for me to work with
i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable
the best part is the price
i bought 4 pcs of these at 8each shipped
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard
should last her a very long time
its not bad enough to deduct a star
but they most certainly are not
it does the job well and is pretty large
i shouldve bought this to replace the original switch from the start
between 7 and 13 earns it 4 stars
these are not coming off anytime soon
there is no noise or other problem so far
italian made need i say more
these little tuners are amazing
i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut
otherwise the time machine works fine as described
and just switched the mics out
this is everything you need in a record brush
a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps
our teenager really likes these
i was purchasing from my local music store through amazon
for the price i am very pleased
rhythm and lead styles both sound great
that might thow a few folks off but its a little thing really
there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality
then i found this for about 100 and i immediately sprung for it
relatively transparent and controls are responsive
when i first started playing i loved the coated strings
i loved the orange crush but it was totally unreliable
it also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etc
and the sound is good
this is an always on pedal for me
holds my bass guitars easily as well
in other words great all around
b  recorded dr40 printed to cd
yes its a pain in the butt
i really really like it
right now this amp doesnt need to be tweaked for me
these are all your presets which many amps are doing these days
i like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily
if i need another stand i will buy this one again with no hesitation
i recommend this if youre in the market for one
mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
it gets one less star because of the california prop 65 warning
the cops wont come knocking to serve a noise complaint
the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
i also have the same quality strings on my baritone ukulele
for the price i would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one
behringer is the way to go
and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security
it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin
if i get a new computer i will update my review
took a bit to get used to but they are very playable
amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive
wanted one again so found this one and bought it
but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too
slides are meant to cover your entire finger all the way to the tip
it offers rugged construction and true bypass
try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid
this will fatten up the sound of a dry amp
no noise or hum whatsoever
i am completely blown away with these headphones
thats the sound ive been looking for out of this amp
ive bought these daddario strings a few times because they are a great deal
i get better harmonics with these strings as well
for most metalhard rock music the gain range is enough for me
and then there are the micros
most manufacturers dont list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed
btw i am using this not on the cp series
dont go onto the stage without one on these boxes
my music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much
elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment
comes with everything you need except a drill or a screwdriver of course
recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue
its just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals
loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of naturalsounding distorted tones
the board itself is built like a tank and travels well
i do not have much to say about this
for many guitars including my j45 theres nothing ive found that ive liked better
if i buy another it would be a standard hanger
the electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing
but this will more than meet your needs to use at home
this is my favorite go to tuner
overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother
my experience 1 try to install from disc
i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items
average to 3 i guess
he was very happy with his gift
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
this product works for me and the quality is pretty good
but this for the quality
ive tuned violins guitars and ukeleles with it
just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something
i own at least 8 of these
and i like the mother of pearl yahama inlay on the headstock
the clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built
that said the pedal is great
this unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay
all in all the h4n is a great field recorder
the daddario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price
you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard
this arm hold the weight of a atr2100 microphone fine
it plays well and the sound
this new strap is plenty long enough and looks good
on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone
this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them
the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control
there is no close second
i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include
ill use the case for my higher end hohners as needed
its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way
my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself
they work well on my electric and my acoustic
what do you say about a little chip of celluloid
this slide is very thick and works great
i would recommend it for light to moderate use
i would look elswhere for a different product
i ordered this primarily for my 5 string ovation bass
unlike every other music stand ive used that one can simply force into position
sounds clear and crystal good unplugged
it it isnt broke dont fix it
i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well
is what it is and does what it says its does
eg low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string
im more than 20 years of playing guitar
i mean they are not computer speakers or anything
i just miss the mecanical click of a mechanic metronome
this is a great capo
i mean my computer is really stripped down
guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar
these heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound
in the tonal category these strings fell short
we will continue to use beefy slinky strings
much better than the one i received with a guitar i ordered
bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine
these work much better than standard stamped trees
he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand
for this price you cant beat the item
bracing is light  the entire guitar is light
i have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me
the e and b strings never have enough coating but still
they sound great and id purchase them again
if that isnt what you want then i would look elsewhere
but over all this amp is a most welcome deal
then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them
if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again
youll only want the cover and footswitch if youre playing in a band
want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good allround metal tone
epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar
some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency
i like the look and feel of these
if you need one might as well be this one
installed on a tele i built
all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist
606060 be warned this review may not help you
i play bass with these and they have a unique tone
ive used several different kinds of strings over several years playing
a more odorsensitive person might feel differently
inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune
so far i am a very satisfied customer with this cable
there are many clipon tuners but i liked the following about this tuner 1
nice and loud in a small package
the real problem began when i switched to different strings silk and steels
the sound out of these things is pristine
if youre toating between practice with an instructor its okay
these are working a lot better for me
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love
great mic for the price
if you like muffs youll really like this one
they appear to be very well built and sound just fine
this one is just a waste of money
the screws  anchors are poor
this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from
at 2000 this bag is a steal
i stand by my logically opinions of this item
downloadable presets on the internetconsdistortions and overdrives are pretty meh
it works in win 7 just fine
i would buy it again if required
aside from the passive electronics
you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen
it clings to the gloss finish nicely
very good for light portable set ups
i cant speak for someone with a bit smaller of a headand ears
these things are heavy duty and thick
5 stars for what they are
got them today and put them on a wasburn x series
to my ears this is a sm58
it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away
i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite
i used it a few times
but if you like longevity and less squeak
this strap is sturdy and robust and its plain black
the one i got kept cutting in and out
great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price
what if you need delay and modulation
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
its performance is minmax the same
by far the most versatile pedal i have ever used
manufacturers website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar
most other recorders in this price range dont have xlr inputs
i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks
cons i wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me
this worked out of the box
it removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately
i got a half dozen for christmas and was thrilled
price seems high for what it is and vs
i have been using this preamp for a year and it has been great
it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price
so for such a simple device you really cant beat it
okay  color coding is a great idea
midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasnt cutting it
if theres even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it
the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged
can find anything better for this cheap
i dont own the srh840s but rather the srh440s
in summary 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service
to me for the price its made cheaply
they are easy to play
most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man
pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this
the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 775 x 65 approx
performance using the behringer was good
this was a huge disappointment
this thing will test most all the cables a musician will use
easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap
overall i have to say that im satisfied with the fender polish cloth
and there are multiple sound options including phantom and instrument
these picks have served me very well
i bought a set awhile back for my ovation but never used them
it was quieter with a much better midrange
i like this tuner as much as my sn8
it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding
overall i like the design and flexibility
forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one
i used it live and they are really great durable and it feels pro
these are a good value for quality strings
good price came quickly through prime
these are the best picks out there
product was delivered safely and promptly
its like the blue blocker sunglasses
is ready to give guitars several times its street value fullon competition
this are some great strings
so given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem
ive been playing for more than 30 years
these are my goto acoustic strings
after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase
that was over 3 years ago
the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy
these strings honestly arent for rhythm
mounted and this looks like a solid product
now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore
i purchased the us600 specifically for the 34detune34 effect
and it works very nicely with the dunlop dual design straplok system
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning
they play well and last reasonably well
all my electric guitars are equipped with these
these babies are dead quiet
after three days the battery goes out
great for linking closequarter effect pedals
havent put a pad there or anything
i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain
when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer
im running 365vdc on the plates and 340vdc on the screens
they worked well and were easy to install
well executed black guitar strap
it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away
so are these any good
that certainly explains the difference in price
i got these because they were recommended replacements for the fostex t50rp
dont be in a rush
well at least for me
the product description seems to report a weight of 85 ounces
so i cant comment about them
i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes
ie 12ay7 12at7 and the mullard 12ax7
its not that hard though and the reward is worth it
i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out
its red burst like the legacy fender calls it antique burst
durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color
ill have to see over time which brand out lasts the other
i couldnt figure out the different tunings on it though
helps the grip a lot
further it will not add something else to findloose in my pants pocket
no more misplaced or lost picks
looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks
amazon had it and at a good price
im pretty impressed with it
its a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases
it is an excellent backup capo
you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model
five stars for performance take away one for greed
this box is very well made and will last a long time
i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall
the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off
strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with
thats where the yamaha really falls short
and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything
this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one
id say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection
these are slick and seem harder to keep track of
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together
thats probably a rare problem for the intended user
purchased this for my son who plays both acoustic and electric guitars
took me about 15 hours
best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody
it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue
good price just as described
i just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away
its built like a tank
highly recommended for frequent string changes
like they were made for it
this blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole
its usb connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity
they help nail his tone and are slick light feel and handle bends perfectly
tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just ok to me
cigar box guitar 3 string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna 6 string
im just a dude in a band
this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound
i put these strings on my guild acoustic electric
while a motu ultralite for mixing  tracking is plugged into the xlr connection
both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp
construction is about as good as i would normally get on a 13 item
ive been using the mxl990
this feels like a professional microphone
tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge
im used to conventional steel finger picks
seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price
these picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms
it is a great reliable tuner
a nonbuiltinbuiltin tuner at this price cannot be beat
it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly
tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again
you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those
dont last but a couple weeks
i was short a shock mount for one of my cad condensers
the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options
the buzz increases in volume over time
cannot beat the value for price
which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring
and not waste of money or an unwanted item
this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so i returned it
nothing to complain about here 5 stars all the way
you can use it in a number of different ways
if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed
unless trying to use the jam
once you try these picks you never go back
the pockets are packed with books tools and strings
i cant find a single complain about this amp
works great and to me its cheap
i love all the options you get with this pedal
this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies
this came today and i must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly
the bright colors make them difficult to lose
i turned that light off and the buzz went away
the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks
it is easy to use
this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase
fit my 12 string with no problems
the guitar fits it fine
think the jimi blues cd
im very happy with this pg58
ok ive owned 2 of these danelectro amps
like the pic holder on front
the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too
so again another reason for the 5th star
but unless you are new to guitar you know that
but i cant recommend this product
who may bump it and knock it over
if i had the money id stick one of these on all my guitars
i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago
they are comfortable but not as comfortable as id like
if you need an 808 clone on the cheap this is your pedal
its plastic thats 1 star deduction but in this case very pleased overall
i only wish id ordered the lights
it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well
one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these
i do not know anything about guitar
i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner
like a cranked tube amp
i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards
i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly
the bag is simple canvas
its nice to have a place for picks on the guitar
hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall
if you use all four fingers buy two sets
i bought them at 45 dollars
the set is quite nice for the price
i found it very accurate
sturdy had it for a few weeks now
the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly
you  might pay more for a name brand case
this is the best clip on tuner out there
i decided to try the guardian and save a few bucks
the fit  finish speaks quality
i wanted to experiment with a thin pick
the pick holder work as described
the reviews on all joyo products are extremely polarizing
it sounds great for blues and rock
good quality for the price
this tascam interface works great with pro tools
one nitpicky point of criticism  the packaging is an issue for me
very easy and simple to use
the cable material is very bendable and easy to work with
it is my sons first guitar and he is learning on it well
id say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals
good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall
there are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well
my first guitar ever i am happy with it
a 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal wont power it
want a really good china
heres my take  for what its worth
after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better
also it clamps without bending the strings
very easy to grip and last long
these monitors have 70watts powering a 5 woofer and a 1 tweeter 40w30w respectively
was transferred to a dept
i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band
you do receive two other software options with the device
im sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways
all pieces that were advertised were included
i thought id try these out and i loved them
however the angle makes that very awkward
much better for the money than i was expecting
did a ton of research out there b4 i bought this
first the natural finish is what got me started
youll need a feedback buster and a good preamp
in rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful
undoubtedly better for more accomplished players
it is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others wont
typical behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound
you can definetely trust them to do their job
i own several tube amp combo and halfstack
worse even than the oils and acids on our skin
at the time the ac2s were selling for about 85 new
either way dunlop is the best and for a great price
opened up one recently and the
i have not tried it with other stringed or nonstringed instruments
the build seems very good
i will buy planet waves from now on
whats not to love about these strings
the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide
i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers
one doesnt get much better than daddario strings
thats what makes them so much fun to play and modify
the cover is supple and easy to coil
the classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp
tested with a les paul with burstbucker pros the hiss was overwhelming
its not that it does not have it just could use more
nice cord sturdy build good sound
this is a great tuner at a reasonable price
i think the price is a little high for what it is
its close enough for my needs
its worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these
i use to protect my microphones
the result is an amazing clean boosting eq
this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course
you never know until you try
this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use
i write and record my own music
anyway the bottom line is that daddario phosphor bronze are my go to string
we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered 2 more
some will disagree saying they break if theyre too thin
ive had this for about 11 years now
the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal
one spot has become the standard
if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
i would recommend it as a good economical all around amp
i have many heavy guitars
and you cant beat the price
this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use
no bite to it at all
hey jerks do you play guitar
from very thin and flexible to 08 and hard you get a selection
these are a musthave item
mine arrived broken so it had gone back
its lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory
this is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier
howevermy tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings
it requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time
i purchase these strings a lot for my son
i would much prefer a round base
ive owned a halfdozen led music stand lights over the years
first impression of profx8 is very good
then id try a different set every 3 days
it seems to keep things humidified very well
i am still using these everyday
ive read its not really complete isolated but it does the job
a lot of harmonics and output captured
i get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks
i installed the ragin cajun into my fender super champ x2
update   we received a replacement for this item
even nimh 12v batteries can power this although alkaline 15v last longer
reduces string noise as promised
it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked
i own the black silver gold and camo kyser capos
my favorite is the 070mm
upon comparing the resulting  cds
it is easy to assemble
the 12 club zt is super loud
i have a 75watt amp that powers a 12 celestion speaker
i bet marcus would kill with them
seem good not legendary and tremelowhammy standard zinc block theres the must upgrade part
light construction but  you get what you pay for
the cable died on me in less than a month
also each instrument is different each peg is different
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar
these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems
not the most beautiful thing but worked
with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag
at 8ohms i still get good volume
easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight
luv it i had version 1 and this amp isnt much different
naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling
i have yet to decode their colors or naming system
the sound was much nicer to my ears as well
these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well
ive also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands
i dont work for the company or have any ties whatsoever
the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable
same with treble bass volume and all other effects
these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are
its a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup
way to thick for me
you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit
only problem is the clip on install to the strap
great price but unfortunately this product didnt work for me
i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out
elixer definitely still has the edge
straight into a guitar amp it gave plenty of volume
the local shop only charged me 5 to shave them down
this orange micro crush amp lives up to its name
this one is done right
definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future
folks this is a stellar device at a throwaway price
appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever
thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon
the plastic housing is extremely strong and wont bust when used properly
the display is easy to read
best sounding of all smooth on my fingers
it is exactly what i wanted for a great price
the good this box is simple and welldesigned
ive only used the string winder so far but it works well so far
the display is bright and the interface is very intuitive
i even moved it once and it still sticks fine
these really are the best tuners out there  you should get one today
it doesnt have much value on your belt clip
i dont like the feel or sound of these strings
the polish in the bottle works well and the lintfree cloth works well too
casual part time guitar player here
it was time to replace all with frest strings
i have used for few times so i dont know about its longevity yet
like my title says this gets the job done and is well built
this is a very serviceable strap at a great price
i also found that im getting better response with my guitar tone knob too
where i really noticed the difference was in recording
comes with wall anchors but i usually look for a stud to mount on
i used in all my concerts and its excellent
it doesnt sound exactly like a vox  but i dont gig
my kids love to hear me play it
it doesnt cost a lot
an integrated flip out kickstand would make this perfect
thats my only complaint about it
it plays very loud and clear zero buzzing
a little to thick for my style though
no telling how long the switches will last
i also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument
i always lose my damn picks this helps
the case is nice as well
i can get a kyser or something for fifteen bucks
these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought
he says they last a lot longer and sound better too
sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs
i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range
ive been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade
next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay
this works much better in that regard
if youre a roadie for a big group i could see the need
you have a level control a gain control and a tone control
ive turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy
ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos
i feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient
seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so
i like their longevity too
it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones
the hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability
cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster
only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly
i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar
its light weight and sturdy
just buy the product and get on with happy music making
very compact size and easy to use
the other has some kind of short in it
the range of thicknesses generally works well and daddarios tend to be pretty consistent
the amp has light sound and not much control
they are all battery hogs
this product isnt really one to review but it does what it advertises
you cant go wrong with genuine fender parts
this thing can get really loud
i do not use it for powering only one pedal though
i have just receive mine just now
i did blues metal country and pop
thank you amazon  fender
its plastic so dont jump on it
they are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders
you knew that when you bought it
pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments
theyre great for metal if you like a durable pick
it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon
feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever
disappointing was looking for to receiving these
excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal
good cable and has m et all of our needs
this is a very good ts type pedal at a great price
i got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect
it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit
please note that im not a newbie to this stuff
in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars
the price is great and it works
im using it for so many things including a music player for my truck
the cushioning is nice and thick as well
a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing
they last keep in tune and keep their tone
i like to walk around while i play
plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it
nice cover for my behringer xm8500
i dont know what kind of strings are on it out of the box
it is not heavy and the price is good
and they all are super
though once you get used to it it is easily avoided
it leaves very little rosin dust on the violin
if it can tune that it should handle your guitar or bass fine
this worked well for that
great simple pedal clean sound
then order this great little solution to a big problem
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps
i guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working
still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price
all in all these arent bad
this sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off
as expected from hosa another great product
it looks and feels so high quality
these strap pins are fantastic
not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand
its right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time
they all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade
its tiny and doesnt look like a fisherprice product
this was not thought out very well
this is the only type of stand i prefer to use
anyone that wants a nice versatile pedal this is the one you want
i like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease
not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a 90 guitar
she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics
you cant beat the price
very easy to tune my basses
under the strings and it muffled a few
i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet
does what it says it will do  keeps your strap locked on
i dont really notice a difference when i use different cables
they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff
i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals
i say go for it
this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces
joyo jf03 crunch distortion   this little guy surprised me
you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product
it also has that vintage fender coolness factor
it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive
bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome
its quality outweighs its price
i have stopped using asio4all and i get decent latency
pros price pointgood clean audio quality when working
baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names
the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath
there is no way i would use these
i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great
fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them
great output jack i love this one much more because is more durable
the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time
my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s6 and i really like it
that is a great bonus for me
if you gig or record and need a reverb
i can get better string control compared to other strings
lack of any impact resistance  the bag has no padding at all
its simply not sturdy enough physics or no
ive already posted about fast fret
the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound
did i mention it has a blue light
not my style but they work ok
you know what i mean if you are a professional
it works for me perfectly
but i only use my favorite strap
i havent had a problem with this
ive had them for 23 months now and they havent failed me yet
if you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals
i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard
its not a metal type distortion but it nicely covers everything else
not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 13 its beefier
highly recommended for the price
feels sturdy enough and its adjustable for a man of any size
definitely a real good value for the money
they were already worn out
i needed a cheap good quality mic and this fit the bill
all sound really good and completely adjustable
i was not happy with the sound of these strings
wish all pedals were built this way
i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them
looks great really classes it up in my opinion
i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree
very well made although the bag is a little lower quality
a string winder and cutter
what the hell was behringer thinking
brilliant solution to the strap button problem
the crisp and solid vibration is just top notch
my go to strings from now on
worth the money great product
but they are what they are
it can initially be a rather shocking experience
if you play with nails and want finger picks these are for you
i have used that other sbrand on other instruments and really prefer the dunlops
so i just got this product havent used it
ive been happy with them so far
im opting for the convenience of the size
i tried airing it out for a week with no success
easy to mount solid grip on guitar
so i ended up returning it the next day
these sounded different gel picks
it works and does at it is supposed to
will confess that id like a 12string but thats another animal
these really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars
i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model and after only one week
easy to install also and for the money give them a go
attaches to my audio interface
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated
instead it was only 2 cheaper than buying at my local music store
i dont have to guess or squint
it has a nice red paint job
buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer
i just slapped one of these on my reliced 94 mim fender strat
this one really fits my taste
it is just very wasteful for the cost
having an fx send is awesome when using it live
super easy to use and a musthave for anybody who gigs out
martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow daddario just shines
i bought a second one
60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick
the cons definitely outweigh the pros here
this pedal in short sucks
i have been using hercos for for many years
these martin strings m170 arent bad
the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday
id play wirewrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings
this stand even accommodates a double neck
cons wish i had this 20 years ago
i was a bit disappointed in this gadget
who knows but it looks way cool lol
very beatiful and good quality
good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply
just a push on the pedal and im switching noiselessly between guitars
i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings
they are the only ones i trust
i also purchased a musicians gear   http www
these cables are very good quality
i chose this because i wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings
from the front you can barely notice it at all
ill be looking at additional items from this company
the soundis full and fills the room
price cant be beat either
the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up
very well made with good padding
in all actuality its a really simple design
each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting
also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range
grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones
they work good for the sound on the strings
there is a big and a small slot
ive had it for about six years
i used a 38 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully
true meaning of the us dream
they are great for holding picks  make wonderful gifts
put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier
however there are workarounds like just switching tracks
my favorite is still the g7th capo
i only wish that more came in a single pack
this is a cool gadget
i have a candy apple red squier surf statocaster
paid less than half through amazoncomgreat product that works very well with nitro finishes
you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better
play on guitar rig and amplitude
this thing is fun to play with
the accuracy in my opinion just isnt there
heres a link to an ab comparison i did with an sm57
they look great feel great and play great
ive used ernie balls on electrics for even longer
it does what its supposed to do what else can i say
very nice product great quality
the weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock
the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff
the product is here and i am glad the size is right
built well its casing is made out of metal not plastic
daddarios last a long time for me and they sound good
this stand is very stable and useful
there are other excellent strings available
i sold it after using it for about a year or so
cool tube piezo tone from my shencpk8t is dropdead gorgeous
this guitar with amplug just sound amazing
my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird
the lace hot gold value pack with a hot gold hot bridge pickup
the autoclose function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger
good luck and good music to all
but these for the price work fine
ive used the sd1 with both singlecoil and doublecoil pickups
they always provide vibrant tonal quality
i have a few tuners that are somewhat like this gt1 clipon tuner
im not going to gush over this one
air conditioning can do the same
weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant
definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future
one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals
not much to say about patches
bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1
there arent enough uke straps out there for a good price
i play using this device
ill be sticking with these for the long run
this one does it all
theyre round and they fit over microphones
i got the same tuning results on all of them
cables are good my only complaint is the connectors
make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death
addendum   i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributormanufacturer
the unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature which i leave on
since i did not see similar comments from others perhaps mine is not representative
i didnt realize they would hold large tripod stands
just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery
some love them more than any other string and some are like me
it works awesomely and its not a bad price for name brand cables
itll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing
tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years
speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces
i wrote a least three times and got no response so far
i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isnt one of them
good tone and they stay in tune
there is no click assuring that the cable is in place
it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much
no problem with any chemical reactions
want to get serious about a wah
one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type
that makes it fairly useless
the screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time
is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough
the fit and finish seems like quality also
or to the desk where i sit and play
the two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable
im surprised that the maker of amazons popular at2020 would go this low
i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night
it does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color
this guitar stand is as basic as you can get
turn in half way up you get a clean sound
it has about six knobs
i didnt use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable
for me they were a waste of money
this thing stands up nicely on all three
every color and size youll ever need
two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability
the effect is subtle at best
overall great strings and pretty consistent
never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker
he wanted a tone that sounded like his
i could have used a baggy to hold my picks
i like it and it was well under the price of others
this is a great microphone for 10 bucks did i just say 10
a good purchase for a low priced capo
additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door
i just wasted away 40 something bucks add shipping
it feel like leather but i am not 100 it is true leather
i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass
sweet and warm when the drive is down
it does the job is comfortable and the price is right
i am currently overseas and didnt want to bring my good guitar along
only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each
they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound
old tech bungee type of capo
and even play your mp3 player while you play and sing
playing feel is fairly smooth for roundwound strings and they last for ages
so like most daddario strings
i frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously its a huge convenience
i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear
i think they perform very well for the price
shipping was fairly fast and its ready to use straight out of the package
the cm2 sounds great in both applications
so i bought based solely on the reviews here
great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic
the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy
they all sound very cool on this amp
i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical
i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine
it is not too tight nor too loose
the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiplesized tuners
size hands i find its a good fit
the cable also looks nice and completes the fender look
ill bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out
another quality product from hosa
this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball
it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less
clamp it on and play
but this one is just fine
a must have for us dry californians
i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings
if it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating
i dont think the cat would appreciate that
the topend professional compressors keeley pedals rack units etc
i dont often use picks but when i do i use these
arrived before projected delivery date
just dont put too much weight on it while using it
amazingly it is made in canada not china
i have a 57 reissue strat and i cant tell the difference
high quality and great sound
nice quality and good price too
im a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s  vibe
i think this is my fifth behringer pedal
this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it
they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time
the knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough i guess
schaller guitar strap locks work really really well
the depth knob does its job
i am glad i got the ds1 but for other reasons
this is the wah i was looking for
nicely sound it gaveup on what brand of strings you use
expect to pay 5 to 6 for a replacement battery
overall i give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter
easily installed on my parlor guitar
simply search  for guitar stands on here and see for yourself
theres nothing better than these strings
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal
but i mostly play punkhardcore and blues which is does very well
it would be hard to beat
but i probably wont get these again
this is a nice strap
this is my 2nd or 3rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far
i honestly didnt notice anything different
that was surprising since its a usb mic
i will say that its very easy to play
this is an amazing guitar
it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out
ive never met a set i liked in any single way
but this is going to change all that
i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar
operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass
also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash
thats what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in youtube
i use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome
as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful
i know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile
they need to rethink the design
they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate
another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power
i remembered 34eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie34 and just tuned away
if your dog loves toys keep this out of reach
i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy
always a great sound at a great price
the tone range is generous from mellow to high treble
the retailer gave me some mediums
dont forget to remove it when you guitar is resting
it is the best playing best sounding 12 string i have ever played period
nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp
dont hear any anomalies in the audio
i usually use 9s but decided to try these 10s instead
i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power
i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it
it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything
i just did my 3rd weekend with the same set
tip  these picks are great for high actionhigh gain guitar solos
i found that others had the same issue
its been good i cant really complain considering its basically tree sap
it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order
this shoulder rest is very comfortable and really helps get the right playing angle
the jf02 is truly my favorite right now
wish i discovered these years ago
seems to work well though i dont know how long its supposed to last
it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing
this is a great package for beginners
i actually got this for my acousticelectric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it
how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating
for warmwoman tone go pure nickels thats pure folks
and this with that extra filter on it it blocks even more
it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism
you dont bend your finger to play slide
basically it is much more to the point
having played guitar for 45 years i have tried and used many many capos
this is true but isnt a complete description
i hope that doesnt happen with an adapter
fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances
the stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe
since i have better equipment now i havent used it as much
drducks wax is worth the extra 3
they do need 48 v phanom power from your board or a mic amp
if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you
good string action out of the box
i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends
for the money this ones a nobrainer
i cant say enough good about this amp
the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones
i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin 016ny
this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up
the snark sn1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate
to me these always feel perfect
worth every penny as long as it lasts
i plan on buying him another set of them for christmas
feels solid and stays in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions
even the case impressed me
pros  it is small bright well built and works great
they appear to hold up well under constant moving
the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted
for the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life
they are still going strong
nothing to special but it was good enough for that
since i first got it ive rearranged once already
oh well just shows me little by little more and more things arent anymore
when you record singing you need this to prevent the pop sound
it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing
im not kidding  it was one of those finds
i bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price
my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs
i do not have giant hands so large should fit
i brought for someone else
i would if necessary purchase this item again
it really saves on batteries and extension chords
still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast
if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chart
so that is the downside
this a very clever idea
this cradles my guitar nicely
truss rod is behind a nice body color plate
if you dont have a preamp system this will do you no good
this does the job perfectly
the secondposition for the harp in c is g not terribly common
i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve this
the seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days
a genuine fender part that looks great on my 10 mim strat
otherwise i use this cable at every show
the tuners i have for my guitarbanjo have modes for use as a metronome
the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time
actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great
if youre even thinking about buying this just buy it already
and has 2 nice leds
easy to set and adjust while playing live and onthefly
the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles
the metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable
if you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand guaranteed
these are really great guitar locks
worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased
say good bye to batteries
for the price this does everything and more
really like the eq on the main output
these have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern
i now only use metal slides
other people i know whove had this tuner have complained about lack of durability
but this one worked perfectly
world has gone bass crazy since about 1981
ive had this pedal for a number of years
stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity
works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises
they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights
it is like an added bonus
tascam should consider a similar accessory
easy to put on the guitar
love the color coding too
i recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal
i prefer them at 90 degrees so these are just right
it took quite a long time to get it right
i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p
good buy for the price and nothing else is required
spend an extra 10 and save yourself the headache
many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price
wow there is a lot of space on this thing
this is a very useful little device
this one seems to consume coincell batteries at an unacceptable rate
its ok but not the best fog machine out there
i am now dedicated to these strings
sometimes people dance right in front of us
this unit works as advertised
nice case but doesnt provide the protection that i need for my guitars
i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint
i recently acquired a vox valvetronix ad100vt combo amp from my local music shop
anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good heres a few add ons in case
i thought that more than 25 of the items cost was a bit much
i cant say much about this product
plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands
the tone isnt bad just not as good as a martin uncoated string
my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit
they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them
ive got a 12string acoustic guitar
however the rocktron zombie doesnt sound good through solid state amps
isnt that asking a bit much
another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass
leaving me with the same music and way less background noise
it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid
cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks
very functional and easy to work with
cant say much more than the description
i decided to replace the saddle with this one
this cable is complete garbage
pick up a used one
you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right
ive been so impressed by epiphones but this one didnt do it
tons of useful information on this wheel
ive used this pedal with a casio px200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now
quality of manufacture and assembly great
its getting easier with these
the metronome feature is also a nice addition
so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand
it has what you want in a cable and not what you dont
with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response
and the fender frontman  not even in the ballpark
even using a capo 100 recommended
i keep in e flat tuning and it stays
i have been using these for months now with 5string bass
so thats a consideration if youre a beginner
haha it made me laugh
the 8020 are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp
in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection
i had alesis io2 express which did a similar job
has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars
i bought this used off a friend when i got my first electric
but eventually i figured it out
as with any pedal it wont make you a better player
meh these things are what they are
great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap
the cable shipped fast and i couldnt be more pleased
this tin should last a lifetime
maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly but i dont think so
needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill
they fit perfectly and are of high quality finish
monster cable is one of the things on earth we can count on
im now a zoom fan
these strings sound light and bright
its not a riot but
con  the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully
also got the tuning pegs
ill never go back to tuning by ear
the coated ones are medium which is too heavy for me
this is a good solid cable with no problems
i may have to tape it down to keep it in place
it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar
bought another one for my friend
the photo cannot do it justice
the neck strap and the base are excellent
i just ordered another skb fender case
the mc401 is compacl but its heavilyconstructed so it stays put
if you want to play metal youre going to need a distortionoverdrive pedal
great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff
overall a decent playstarter uke and worth the 30
you might be surprised how good it sounds
ive had it for about a year now and have no complaints
what is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device
the bench is comfortably padded and very affordable
this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones
all connections are 14 mono
also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use
reasonably comfortable but i dont want it cutting into my neck
i like it with the power supplyno batteries to fuss with
the 3 foot is perfect and it works great
save your money this pedal is good enough
am very happy with what i got for the price i paid
it reacts quickly and is not oversensitive
still have it and love it
i might have done something wrong
smooth tone the right amount of gain perfect to push a tube amp
theres also three switch positions  off on and fx
the build quality is outstanding and its true bypass
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s
its meant to be left on an instrument
i believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand
i have a collection of straps but not a black one
any flaws would be quite noticeable
these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors
i own a number of guitar hangers
screws just the right size
this is a very good piece of equipment for its price
quite a few people are complaining about the buzz causedinduced by this
turning the odrive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle
i needed something with eq on it as well
while youre at it buy ten sets
seller is a in my book
color wasnt as advertised its more of an offwhite than a vintage cream
its worth spending a jackson imo
volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results
fortunately ive another plus a korg and an two intellitouch
ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it
amps are pushing itplus a gig bag and school back pack
theyre shiny and screwed well into the holes
the bag has removable backstraps for carrying ease
hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully
these are well made cables with 90degree connectors which is exactly what we needed
i recommend going with these
it works and is my second favorite
specifically it has an output impedance of 50 ohms
great for singing micing amps and such
i have very small hands so they work for me
moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise
im a teacher not a student
like noticable and just horrible
got gold to remind me it is for six strings
it does it all and is tougher than nails
a lot of overdrivedistortions filters modulations delays reverbs all carefully modeled
like always dimarzio products are simply the best
no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it
they have 34punch34 and 34snap34 which are good things to have in a bass
it holds a mic just fine
just click the buy it button
plush interior hardware looks great and good quality
you will be pleased and your bank account will thank you
i use clayton 126mm picks a heavy pick but certainly not oversized
use them all the time
im a 62 yo newby to guitar
so ill update should i encounter problems
like many i cannot afford a tube amp
great value and a great tool
the guitar just stays in tune now period
love the coil love the price
i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well
this guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box
it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board
the block is full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles
i ended up putting the screws back in
kudos to amazon for posting this warning
strings might look tacky but theyll stay on there if tied properly
cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound
its your guitar on steriods
its much better than what i got with my violin
to be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different
or at least not much
i did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good
i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way
wuhan makes great products for the money
im not a switch whole patches on the fly guy
it is a good purchase
seams strong  seams like it will last
this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness
for distortion look at other boss pedals
not all picks are made the same  some are far better than others
i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller
but if you really want to be amazed do an ab comparison
in fact i found it increases speed
this little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size
great foot rest i recommend it
why do they sell an instrument with crap strings
makes the champ a super champ
this is my first strobe tuner
the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping
so certain compromises have been necessary
but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a dropin replacement
forget the fab series they are not so hot
unfortunately theres no 22nd fret on this guitar
this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before
you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw
nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time
personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk103
i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand
i hope if yall get one
i bought this using prime and am happy with the power supply
you really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly
these are a littl ehard to play
but when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic rocks
so it wont sound the same on every guitar
i used an 1164 drill bit for the pilot holes
i only use something different if i need a longer reach
hard to day too much but it works great
the behringer u control gives me stereo now
in fact i am pretty impressed
as with any other boss pedals its well made and reliable
however my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely
i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah
i recommend this capo without reservation
the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way id hoped
they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily
no scratches or anything on my taylor
but you need to rehearse
i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this
i have a dreadnaught resting on it now ready for use
my old one lasted a long while and it still works
i wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar
affordable technology in the service of great art
excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage
im also going to put on some elixir light strings
youll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes
100 postconsumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load
i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it
they work and are cool looking
i play 12 nights a week in a midiassisted duo
this pedal is 998 sounding like the mxr
it also has a dry through output
takes the edge off the violin sound
these are good strings but not 5 stars good
though it will gouge your floor
it is very small  a little bit larger than a grape
the other one is shorter
but i must say  so are these
im a beginner harmonica player and this was perfect for me
i felt as if the uke was well worth the low price
so i wasnt choosey about the colors i got
ive bought three for gifts
the amazon price is terrific
the metal fingerpicks are rock solid sturdygauge steel
im sorry martin but i like the elixers the best
most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust
as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired
this is my third purchase of this tuner
with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly
all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price
this is worth the investment for your expensive mic
the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy
id prefer something more white
i expect the pick to wear down from use
also note i play with the rounded edge not the tip
i didnt think id use it much but i do
this is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich
and im still waiting to hear back
it looks very stylish and functional as well
however youll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse
kind of flat and lifeless
its very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer
compared to the tortex style pick material 1 mm for the tortex
im not on tour with any group
im not sure about battery life i havent gotten there yet
ive been using this polish since the early 80s
they should make a metal edition for that
corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings
the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part
it is definitely worth the few extra bucks
they are the perfect size and shape
when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar
i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately
the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well
i didnt even notice a smell
duncan type often suffer from nonpositive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed
also the clamp works well
unlike the edirol the h2 comes with a simple stand
i play rythm leads and sing in my gig
i like the size of the stand and the flexibility
these really are a good set of strings
my wife bought this guitar for me as a gift
none broken yet but i dont usually break strings
nice bag with great features
you get what you pay for
the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked
they could have done better on that end
sound quality crisp mid and high range
it did fit my kala katg with room to spare
the larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath
needed a pre amp tube for my hartke lh500 and ordered one of these
still looking for the right picks for me
the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree
change the strings every couple of months
i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk
my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap
fit and installationregarding fit these have 2 little pins on the backside
do you like to shift your booty around on the seat
the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong
however these definitely arent reliable gigworthy tuners
if it is the pickup will mute the a string and its annoying
i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost
updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses
we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired
i am very happy with this product so far
enhances string life and tone
i wouldnt venture to use it on the road all the time
the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved
a cheap guitar at best
it does pick up percussive noise which you dont get with under saddle pickups
i have done it for you
big win for the guitar though
this is a fine bag for a guitar i got it for my brother
i looked at all the wires inside and they look ok
these days on my pedal board i have several mxr micro pedals
the boss pedals however were hit or miss
the guitar sings beautifully the tone is rich and vibrant
they are comparible in tone to dean markelys and slinkys imho
for the money this is one of the best products ive reviewed
sweet strap nice colors good quality
ive got hours if i chose to
when you do 6 out of 10 times the plastic socket will break
you can buy with confidence
so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing
for 50 you literally cant go wrong
nothing too spectacular about them
thats without the fuse software
this microphone in just a few words is awesome
it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment
that did not last long
one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are
inbetween the lights and mediums
yeah i think a few of these would be nice
i would recommend this product to a friend
texture is very nice doesnt slip
low settings not too echoey more like a bassd out reverb
but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one
the string are easy to play and sound great
getting the recorded signal onto a computers harddrive is expedited with the included usb
most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for
for others they may not appreciate this
best inexpensive right angle cables out there
pop one of these in
wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars
i cant make that claim for prior speakers ive owned
the display is bright and easy to see in most light
but you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you
the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp
the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished
capo is well made and is very well priced
but that costs 2x or more as much
this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one
they are warmer sounding well balanced
the sound guy thought it was an sm 58
i purchased this as my first guitar slide
theres just one button so its idiotproof
some items of gls work great others are awful
bottom line  a great toy
plus i mean come on john mother  frusciante uses them
dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part
why am i so impatient
im thinking of getting another because of this
as capos go this gets the job done at a good price
mine came flattened in a little box
no regrets on the buy at all
latest review downgraded from 5 to 3 stars
there is another device called a uke leash that also works well
i couldnt ask for more
volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear
this product as advertised did not come with any picks
once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different
i only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding
i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim
it is well built and sturdy
i want a refund plus an hourly wage
as another reviewer put it this wont replace your daw
amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc
i am very glad i made this purchase
like i said i love these things
the build quality is solid  it feels like a much more expensive amp
i will no longer use other humidifying methods for my br243a
planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior  can pay
granted you can make a makeshift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon
for the price it is worth
i have room for one maybe two more
it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl
i compared this to a c1 which is pretty good for half the price
they trust their users to read the freaking manual
this is an analog pedal an the only digitech pedal ive ever contemplated keeping
too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly
i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite
they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
at least the hardware in this one is up to spec
my only complaint is i didnt like the clean sounds not to my liking
i have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here
its very cool that it has 5w 1w and
i bought it mainly to use with my nonpedal steel guitar
everything just works great first time
with drum pads i basically either get 0 velocity or max
the mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand
not so much on a flat fretboard classical
the great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost
realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar
then choose comfortable straps that wont scratch your guitar like this one
stays very firm on the arm
i seem to have bad luck with electricacoustic guitars when purchased through amazon
i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained
of course if youre running a chain of drivedistortion pedals youre asking for it
this bottle will last a lifetime
i had it shipped off and back in 7 days
that said i have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well
since it died that first time it doesnt seem to perform the same
i had signal loss using these cables
plays 34dead34 meaning it will not stay intune
its not the ole clip it and go capo im used to
a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories
adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive
not that its a surprise though
check out the video reviews by the userscompanies goldhat3 samashmusic giggear and shadowfw
its light and easy to handle
i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing
microphonicnot a big deal it happens all the time
its also nice for cleaning
i have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder
easy to use portable cheap
i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great
ive been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that
the tone is a touch wooden it doesnt sing as the old taka did
good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery
cons  transformer on cord and antenna on remote
i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price
highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar
i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin
well worth the price of the product
easy to work with and also easy to find
i have a marshall mg15cfx solid state amp
very very loud electric guitar amp
the title says it best its a decent basic mic cable
please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut
its well worth the noney
the only downside is that it doesnt stay tuned for very long
so save your dough buy any color but red
other than that notmuch difference
the strings keep their tone for a long time
where is this pedal now in my collection
which you would expect with all the other stuff it comes with
with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process
id go back to elixir next time
good because itll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles
i my world thats good stuff
you dont need the expensive ones this works just fine
turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger
however to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable
i like it and will use it again
its also perfect for adding vocal effects to small barebones pa systems
does the job and does it well
weve been only using it for two days and so far so good
it feels like the iphone of delay pedals to me so far
the satinfinished cedar top is very easy to marr
does not have an onoff switch which is a bit disappointing
neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed
i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay
this cable only works with dynamic microphones
cord works well and hasnt been any problem to date
really packs a punch haha
if you cant find a container and add your own sponge then buy this
look at the picture of it next to a coke can
it is a bit like discussing our likes in food musicians movies
quality sounding and durable for a great price
the rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone
works really nicely at limiting background noise
i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build
they have different wood grains
although it doesnt have a tone dial it doesnt need one
it is not meant for heavy rockmetalgrunge type music
i should have had more faith in fender
a small device that doesnt color input sound and doesnt get in the way
otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of frail and bedazzled
if yours has this problem send it back while its still in warranty
for some folks this will be fine
as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio
i ordered this one and he loves it
with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar
i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well
my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks
peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less
looking at the tension table daddario publishes its clear why this is the case
i honestly cant say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal
they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new
i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence
you have to install the battery which is no big deal
its solid helps with mounting and will be well used
not much you can say
this is a roundwound string with a hexshaped core
been using these for years
they last longer than most other brands ive used
the dava master control pick dmcp is a very nice  useful pick
marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts
im partial to the chorus
the rogue ra090 comes in a variety of color choices
it is very clear sounding and very well built
it even fits my acoustic 12 string
its solid well made and looksfeels like it can handle the world tour
i give it just 4 stars though due to its design
put our hangers in studs but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall
guess thats why its so cheap
has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models
i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice
ive used shure sm58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968
they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them
you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned
it works on vibration or mic so its very versatile
this thing is just sweet i just love it
all in all 7 very well spent
build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation
i dont often use a pick for my soprano uke
i own a total of five uca202s that i use in different locations
is compact once its folded up
i put it down and didnt use it for quite some time
you can now plug it into the wall
theres no audio interface this affordable
my only complaint about this guitar is that i didnt buy it sooner
to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings
but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument
this versatile tool does what it says it does
really is a great buy
great picks not just for jazz though
i bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great
they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing
however the sound left something to be desired
at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price
i dont typically use the metronome feature but its nice to have it
i actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations
a function i absolutely love
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours
i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these
aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound
the tone it gives isnt bad either
when i order something new i expect it to be new
different materials produce different soundsfeels
i had a similar amp before that died
instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design
i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on
try them youll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy
not impossible but not terribly convenient either
still a great guitar string
it really is a great product
thanks to amazon for offering this great product
its a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle
goes one easy and feels sturdy
thanks amazon for a great product
it was defective in more than two areas
this is a very useful guitar compressor
and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality
he has been getting less callous on his fingers
they snap right in carry sound well and come with a lifetime warranty
im not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices
i really like this tuner
it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy
they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range
this stand is basically dead weight
dials and sliders work smoothly
i was worried that the plastic clips wouldnt hold up but they do
i think this guitar rest is pretty nice
cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele
use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp
there are a couple of annoying inconveniences
high quality and great design
this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped
some peope miss the 34quack34 electric guitar type sound from these other types
i like their full sound and their lasting tones
this product makes your pedals super secure
i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target
mmm i would still highly recommend using an audible metronome
i have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there
i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows
the boost combined with the 2 low bass eqs works wonders for low end
i can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though
this is one of the few cases where id buy new over used
the title says it all
i also bought the green one
think acdc and van halen to metallica
dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with
i would do business with them again
im used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly
but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing
no onoff switch is a bummer but it works
it plugged into my behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely
this case is the best ive ever had
these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on
i installed this in two minutes
i bought 2 of the same ziotek extension cableat the recommendation of focusrite
the wedgie is exactly what ive been looking for
it was packed well and didnt have any damage on it
i decided to give it a good set up
sure but not for this price
sounded lovely for the first hour thats why two stars
i would get this stand again
as far as cq goes these are great no problems feel great sound great
it appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument
good for acoustic and electric guitars
