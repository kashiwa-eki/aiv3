there is also amic holder
this isnt 1960 get an upgrade already
this is a very high quality strap
i believe some people call it 34pixie dust34
and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp
i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely
i have not had that problem with this one so its another plus
the neck is perfectly finished and fast
fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them
there is better in this price range
this bracket holds the ns micro tuner of which i have 3
id suggest that this is not for beginners
looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought 2
wah this is always available and active in the x3 and below
i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it
these are the best ones ive tried so far
it has some other advanced features but i havent need them
im glad i bought this product
this thing really is a puzzler
i use it on my acoustic and electric guitars
spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat
listening to music on them is a joy
no tone control no presence control
not much to say about a basic bag
it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent  dirt but thats it
amazing clarity and worth the 28 and change
this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b3 type of organ sound
i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up
these strings have great tone and feel
the very first appearance is impressive
id describe the sound as a bit 34metallicish34 definitely a sharper tone
the shielding was great as well
i stuck this on her amp so she would not misplace it
i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing
heck maybe uke players should try those too
i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro
that gives this stand more value
con  the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully
generally five or six at a time in various locations
i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the lowe tuner
you need a little time to learn then it will rock you
so far no problems at all
i really dont understand why
before i bought this i had to use a tuner on my laptop
tap function also helps a lot
my second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets
amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good
it is built sturdy and sounds really good
so far ive dropped mine once with no damage
i just cant believe how loud this little baby is
i paid a bit over 12 and it was an amazon prime purchase too
kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen
only needed minor setup adjustments
so we kind of wove it above some and under others
the draw back is the battery installation
uses a 9v battery or power supply
these heavy gauge are the main strings i use
there is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive
there is a big and a small slot
i bought this because the tuner in the rp1000 is pretty sloppy
they are your regular picks
item shipped earlier than ive expected
the one that shipped was the cheaper shiny plastic one
i truly recommend it as a tuner pedal
for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks
its a bit easier to see the display
well father than it looks like it would in the pics
it took weeks to receive them in the us
this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm57
for me this pedal gets you 80 of the way there
this is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most
the sm57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled
but their intended purpose is to speed string changes
in fact i use behringer xm8500 mics  3 pack for 60
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape
it wont make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony
they have a nice textured grip
soundwise i dont find that theyre significantly different from any other pick
i am using it for both some music and computer stuff
replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand
they were cheap and the build quality is fine
so think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional
these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar
so i ordered another one
whats funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge
so you are getting what they say
so i tried this cable and it works perfectly
maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument
you can stop from overdub but not start the loop
our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready
obviouslyin my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs
if anything i try to err on the side of low
it just feels lighter than i like but thats a personal thing
the jasmine s34c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price
i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet
the weight of the stand itself stripped it
this 12 pack was about the same price as 23 packs of elixirs
it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter
this device has really help me
distortion pedals go much better with solid state
also some roomspashosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument
this is a great value
strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with
if youre even thinking about buying this just buy it already
this tuner is amazing even more so considering the price
pros  inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal
they shipped quickly and i will order again and again
an experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me
its a quick release with the buckle
these strings are just prefect and feel awesome
keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine
especially on the ml designed guitars
my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself
also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak
the ends seem to be well made
i trust the planet waves brand
i have many microphones and this compares to the 50
it is a little loud
works great and to me its cheap
recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money
you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish
got here in 2 days
if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another
stock strings have a warm tone
they are 8020 and i prefer those to the other strings out there
and it really works well for home practice situations
the speaker w 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it
better yet use an ac adapter
these speakers worked great for 14 months
these heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound
good breadth of tonal variations available
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise
it sounds good enough that i dont mind the lack of true bypass
you may wat to reconsider buying any filter
do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin
it has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch
if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard
i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy
its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to dawdat interface
i have used them for years and always buy the same model
ive owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk
the tuner is very accurate and compact
favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt thats flexible
the display is bright and easy to see in most light
this is basically the leatherman multi tool for guitarist
thats all i can say
but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate
the winder is nice and the clipper works well
nice and bright easy to see
cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and dont break
automatic  shutoff helps too
this filter arrived very quickly
i have a small recording setup and play guitar and bass with friends
the only negatives ive found are 1
maudio doesnt stand behind their products and ill never purchase anything from them again
the solution may be this zoom ms50g
how do you beat it
great overdrivedistortion for classic rock music
this is the answer to your all your power supply needs
the body and buttons are plastic but solid they dont feel or look cheap
good quality accurate and not expensive
this bag was nicer than i expected for the price
this pedal covers the 34white room34 by cream tone perfectly
does it sound exactly like a 57
it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place
these are the best strings you can buy imho
i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results
if you wanna be that one fat hawaiian guy israel kamakawiwoole go for it
the metronome is pretty loud for the small size
i rate it five out of five stars
i have been using strap locks of all types for years
it works great for that
i was also intrigued by the 34tighter34 tuning aspect of the bars on this
this makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier
this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables
seriously a 2db shelf in the highs
not much else to say about it  it polishes my guitar very nicely
being perfectly  protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it so
filters out the pop sounds
i would recommend these for any guitar player
a friend gives his time to help kids learn music
get this one and have no regrets
both of them sound like there was no capo on
unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic
i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum
ive been so impressed by epiphones but this one didnt do it
they sound great and id purchase them again
if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string
its fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new
and rockisland sound sends it out fast
even in perfect condition its still a subpar case
it is my most used gear in my life right now
most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust
not complaints just works and is reasonably priced
these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought
other than that great strings
string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad
the top is natural cedar
i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy
i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed
the 400 has reverb on the pedal
this is a great stand
seems to be better quality than other cheaper products i researched
i had to be very careful to put it on squarely
no seriously are you buying it
use on blue strat and looks great
makes the champ a super champ
they are easy on the fingers and i prefer the silverwound basses
its a switchless pedal that i put through hell
these are really great guitar locks
these are great patch cables
so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing
plug in ipod or computer with 35mm male cable
you cant go wrong with genuine fender parts
i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics
the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry
knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones
i use this with my mobile dj equipment and it is fantastic
a little flimsier than the at but at the price its good
tuned them once no breaking in
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and theyre just bad
these are not 85x11 paper size
i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone
maybe not the best but it serves its purpose
this guitar is just for you to practice scales practice a tune
great little pedal for a very reasonable cost
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
the steel as expected has more of brighter twang
took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and restring the guitar
quality strings at a very affordable price
please fully check them out
its not an entire bridge assembly but its exactly what i needed
i cant comment on the looper as i never used it
it is still like new
the display pivots to any angle
the cord that comes with it is worth more than that
im sure there are better ones but for me this works well
one of the best  accurate tuners that i have ever used
the odor of adhesive lingered for some time but thats not really a problem
dont buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca
the microcube came with new ac adaptor that supports 110v and 240v
so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help
the larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath
i have a 180 amp but was looking for something a little more portable
i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too
i really really like it
this thing simply didnt work right out of the box
i would buy this amp again if mine was stolen
i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware
finger slides are much harder with these strings
plus wow its a great price
avoid if you can spend more
unlike every other music stand ive used that one can simply force into position
theyre easy to install i havent had one fail on me yet
very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings
the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit
call me a snob but i wanted these to match my fender stratocaster
its worth it if youre not in a hurry
this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes
it isnt the softest strap
i am completely blown away with these headphones
but like many newer players i didnt know any better at the time
i tried different basses with it
restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii
the issues include what i think may be premature breakage
this little dude weighs next to almost nothing
the pictures do it no justice
still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old
it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board
looks awesome with my white jackson
a great pedal well made
the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me
overall dimensions 6 34 x 6 12 x 2 14
both mac and windows are supported
the headphone amp was of particular concern for me
great price for a simple strap at around 5
must less expensive and just as good as others
i was blown away how it could tune my bass
i hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries
well padded and has enough carrying options
the rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo
but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks
not much distanceyou have to 34eat34 the micsbut the sound is great
no fret buzz and i just love the feel of the neck
the bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised
my big muff pi with wicker had hellacious noise i mean unusable
nothings worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple
it also selfoscillates  freaks out quite well
the design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid
theyre reliable and easy to use
these are high quality thick guitar picks
it works awesomely and its not a bad price for name brand cables
so i did thanks hde for wasting my time
it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible
i was tuning in a dimlit room and was able to read it perfectly
the ac3 is not a set it and forget it pedal
fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed
if you are looking at this guitar buy it
i cant write a great review for this
not for guitars with nitro finish
very fast readout and fast on off
4 for these 12 beautiful premium quality picks is a steal
and it looks great too
wipe each string when done and they will last longer
not much to say about a chrome neckplate  its largely a cosmetic item
ill be damned if i put my 1000 guitars on these things
60 to 80 hours perhaps maybe a bit more
im pretty hard on my strings
read my review on those though
the tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable
not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer
just be extra careful handling them
i ordered this for my husband the musician
the most recent one i purchased was not this one
hopefully the at value cable will hold up
first impression of profx8 is very good
dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal
i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable
sounds simple but youll see
ive bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts
i was playing a gig at a small pub
this is a really cheap microphone
maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly but i dont think so
it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet
theyre not bad but dont expect them to last like elixirs do
this product is simple does the job and is well priced
i would not recommend this pedal
that way i can look from a distance
put it on the headstock
we are using an mp3 player for backup
i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable
maybe a dollar if they dont just give it to you
i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains
could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall
originally putoff by the low price i went with the reviews
but it is perfectly adequate for most purposes
i paid 110 shipped for mine so look on amazon or ebay for purchase
it now sits on my amp collecting dust
in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect
aside from that though great product
also note i play with the rounded edge not the tip
ive used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles
the ds1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal
however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks
youll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes
well its size as i measured it is actually 12 inches by 1458 inches
i dont know why they are called big stubby
i have yet to break one
dont know what it is but i love the sound of these strings placebo
then theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed
i would pay this price for just the element
fit finish feel and action were all very nice
when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner
just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage
kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point
its almost like having two stompboxes in one
good quality cable and price
i like it enough that i bought another one
you can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higherwatt amp
of course the color coding is a godsend
its a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft
just slightly heavier feel but much more tone
thumb to little finger i can barely reach an octave on piano
the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference
but for 48 dollars im  happy with purchase
the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys
i like them and my playing buddy likes them
well made xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini
everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings
if you want to sound like 5 dimebag darrels then dont buy this pedal
thanks for good quality products at a fair price
ive used daddario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic
great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board
been using these for years
can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall
however it has not proven to be kidproof
pay attention to the warnings
the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome
they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha
we will be purchasing more picks in the future
quite amazing especially for the price
that was several months ago
but once you got it its a fine product
ive tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to
but for a small woman with small hands its difficult to operate
certainly superior to the old school bandbased jobs from yesteryear
make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual
i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio
once locked theyre not going anywhere
the celluloid ones come two per size
i just ordered 2 more of these
on the e and a strings
they feel great sound great and are extremely cheap
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck
ive tried other brands and they dont swivel  correctly
it took quite a long time to get it right
im not on tour with any group
put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string
once i figure that out all was right again in my universe
what more could you possibly ask for
adjusts easily nice quality leather hookups
ive been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin
they offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings
they cost more than the mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow
the real problem began when i switched to different strings silk and steels
these look great on my guitar
im 62 and weigh 225
i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting
these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on
sometime i use a phaser or a tremolo
ive never had one of these pots fail on me
thats not where elixirs kill the competition though
bbe soul bender  my least favorite vibe
purchased to provide professional level io for recording from mixers etc
i figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment
there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector
it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books
it does all of those jobs well
it clings to the gloss finish nicely
i use it on chromatic but it includes  bass uke and guitar too
the case is also really well made good zippers and stitching
but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for
i have three of these straps more my strats
it isnt shrilling or peaky at all
my first thought was now i have to learn how to play this thing
saves some money on replacements
i think its a good choise for any pedalboards
i only recommend it for something light weight
dont ask then why i got a sn6
will go find real headphones thanks
but of course then its too loud
i have nothing but praise for them
i was skeptical because of the price but these work great
it aired in a few minutes
march 29 2012  just a quick addendum to my initial review
first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board
the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd28
this is the best delay i have tried thus far
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
for 4000 you cant go wrong with this one
i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp until now
you get what you pay for
the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal
an easy item to recommend for the price paid
works perfect for guitar strings
excellent pedal i love this chorus
these schallers are exactly what i wanted
fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase
update now working got my mate an aussie genius to have a look
it works as well as expensive tuners
best sound on all instruments was obtained from 610 feet using the omni mode
however you cannot go wrong with those strings
like the capo and metronome feature
i use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc
i recommend this capo without reservation
nothing is lacking to start playing right away
they look great feel great and play great
its a guitar instrument cable what can i say
the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank
it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous
definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard
i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance
and hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change
worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose
i found mine used for 20 but the new asking price is fair
then i found this and decided to get it
ill have this thing forever
free shipping only makes it that much better
the pickups are really nice
just gettit if u are in a budget
its not bulky which is a nice
ive bought quite a few tuners over the years
never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker
but these are great for about any electric
i also own the cut capo for other styles
excellent fine manufacturing good finish
honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing
i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try
they do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient
imho this the must have addition to your set up
nice quality and good price too
at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case
the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved
053 as compared to my old martins which went from 0012 to 0054
it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter
this is the greatest practice amp ever
i do a lot of recording  i also checked the sound after recording
plenty of cord to move around with
picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps
this is easily adjustable and adds a depth and a nearleslie sound
this cable is really good for the price
they are half the size of a regular pick
ive tried every standard pick  even bone silver  really expensive ones
tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies
i had to give it a shot
i only needed one string but it works fine
i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar
but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better
the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss
it takes some skill to eq things to the point of normalcy
i found it right here it  works well with no problems to report
a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years
this is what fender calls blaceface clean
these and reds are my favorite acoustic strings
this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack
i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck
like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds1
great connection sounds good and no issues at all
pros price pointgood clean audio quality when working
they are very accurate and are very inexpensive
so i will probably be using it on my electrics
i find myself using it a lot
ive had it just over a month so amazon wont help me
quality seems ok but time will tell on durability
i have a significant volumegain reduction now
ive had no trouble with it that i can rememberthink of
this is a standard 3824 threading tap
not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand
it works amazing and saves plenty of time
has a nice smell works like a charm
some headstocks too may be too thick in order to attach this tuner
comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer
overall a fantastic product with a price that cant be beat
who may bump it and knock it over
make sure you have a good microphone to use with it
this is more of a like it or hate kind of item
the thing is i hate overpaying for things
yes it will help you string your instrument quicker
ive been playing rock and blues for over 40 years
it was a total waste of money but doesnt pay to return it
but this strap works okay with it
i drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit
i also know what notes are in each chord
this is a pretty hot pedal
quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors
buy a good sustain pedal
if you are a tone fanatic keep looking
it tunes better than any tuner ive ever used
the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it
this means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever
so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain
the screen could be a little brighter
for under 10 and prime eligible what more can you ask for
dont know what the delay was but it took forever to get here
it certainly wont be for everybody but so far i like what i hear
bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo 6
the builtin metronome doesnt have a lot of volume but its clearly visible
terrific for gigs or practice a back up or just beginning guitar
i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars
i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible
this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning
i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine
have used it on a couple of ukuleles
it is very hard to accurately cut the strings
if you like the design go for it
is just perfect for what is made for
adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos
very happy with this product and the price is incredible
i dont think youll regret it
really like the eq on the main output
i got mine for less than 20 bucks
i guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working
plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker
it has one small pit in the red finish
i would recommend others to try it
it is wide and has leather ends
worth the higher price because of the warranty
ive been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970s
they are all very well made
but fat or skinny daddario makes some of the best strings out there
it is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard
but for less than 100 nice doesnt even describe it
coated strings are a simpler alternative
thats probably a rare problem for the intended user
im elated to know i can now get these buttons separately
how does it sound you ask
i can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red
my hartke 410vx cabinet was designed by an idiot
this pick holder is pretty awesome
it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely
it arrived quickly and was well packaged
promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it
you put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x
i bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son
this is one of the few cases where id buy new over used
this is a fairly good size cloth at that
i would recommend this product to a friend
seller is a in my book
i use this cable a lot and it has stood the test of time
that being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway
but darn it 6 paper envelopes
slim and easy to install though longer than the qk10b
it also looks pretty damn sharp
leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes
can sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars
all this and a secret compartment for picks
one is an inline tuner one built into my amp
this cable is great for xlr microphones or diboxes
they sound great and stay in tune well
i didnt expect much considering the price
you could make it work
if youre a roadie for a big group i could see the need
perfect pedal it sounds great no matter what your levels are
it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back
so for linux users this may be a very attractive option
the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other lessuseful effects
couldnt go wrong for 5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility
for under 200 im amazed at how nice this guitar is
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it
i like them and so does my music teacher
it fit my american vintage 70s strat
windows 7 install worked fine
i love this strap try one you wont be dissapointed
it is not bad but i dont think i would purchase another one
according to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab
does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop
i buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases
it is durable and effective
this is a really nice microphone
worth the money for certain
cant beat these 10 stands
based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences
you end up using just the right ammount
this is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner
they securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely
the optional carry bag is a must imho
only negative check bc the ends are too bulky
ive used these and dont have any problem with them
i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks
they have a really nice sound to them
i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days
the angle for kazoo use is fine
this one is pretty decent especially at the price point
the plastic shaft feels like it will break
seriously this is a great pedal
stays where it is supposed to
this one is an ivoryish color and it is really nice
great sound that only a bone nut can produce
they can leave skid marks on your pick guard
i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me
for the price paid is a very reasonable option
they work and they last
it might not be durable but it looks durable
its a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in
i am buying more gauges too
it is cost effective and looks good
lots of relief between strings and body
its built like a rock  has a very fine finish
i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning
i do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them
really close but they were terrible in operation
overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul
perfect all the way around
i would definitely buy again
truly a great piece of gear
attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system
it keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely
there was some slight noticeable differences
these have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern
i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well
seemed to want to be off too much
make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death
i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led
it actually really surpassed my expectations however
this little unit is packed with great effects
throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rockblues
i have a real problem with these patch cables
it is so soft and comfortable
the good  8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time
lasts a long time 2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar
all in all it works and i am pleased
the thing is quick and accurate
they call these mini tuners but to me they are just right
looking back cant see why i really need it
5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings
yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this
after all thats 2 more strings than its intended purpose
that being said i havent found anything i cant use it on
a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass
i bought this one for its adjustability
but well packaged and arrived on time
5 stars arrived on time and in good condition
if youre looking to recreate the edge sound analog delay is not for you
cheap price and cheap product
some models suffer fits in certain situations
the first power source that is fun
uses 9v batt or power adaptor
so far im very pleased with the jam
the preamplifier has one 12ax7
some case manufacturers have the same problem
i may get one in the future its only 4050 bucks on here amazing
item received looks diferent i say better
the snark is well worth its small price
i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller
it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open
hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down
though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby
double bass pedal has a quality build
their grip is excellent and they feel awesome
also known as shimmer a synth playing behind your instrument
this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments
ill update as to the answers and information provided
got these because i wanted some extra capos around
but theyve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me
my daughter is learning how to play and the
so its doing double duty and going strong
pacific hardware is excellent right up there with tama
however if you need a lot of pedal space read the dimensions
when i buy a new guitar i get new locks
i play using this device
this incredible inexpensive box really nails it
ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully
i was on the fence about whether it was my winner
dr 05  this is a good quality toy
actually theyre not fender they are schaller but that is really good
i have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now
my 1981 lucille did love these strings
or use a nicer external power supply  the first thing id upgrade
i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews
this pedal is remarkable for useful tones
after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy
my advice is look for a more sturdy model
i love this boost pedal so much
i also found using a compresser before it helps
its routed hsh under the hood but looks tight
besides the volume these differences werent huge
i use the chair for guitar bass keyboardsukulele and even cooking breakfast
sometimes it felt a little off but robots know best right
but he loves it and i guess thats all that matters
it is well worth the 60 i paid for it
however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes
are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication
on the other three joyo sound pedals the opposite is true
theyve been shrinking for over 50 years
i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought
makes my voice sound fantastic
i know theyre more expensive but youll be happier off in the long run
the end connectors were well made and strong
at the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars
are just about all the same
i would only go with the sn2
the price is right for what you get
im a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it
folks ive tried them all from dean markley to ernie ball
i have switched to daddarios to capture that frusciante sound
doesnt leave the strings oily or full of residue
that being said it is good for practice and song writing
is easy on the plating and very gentle
i purchased this as my first guitar slide
received promptly and tested out with acousticelectric guitar
i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction
i used to use schaller straplocks but theyre not compatible with all straps
the guitar picks were exactly what i was looking for
the product picture can be a little deceiving
this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness
i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these
i purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar
you will be pleased and your bank account will thank you
ive used a variety of tuners
someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than i did
good cords with a decent length
but if you like longevity and less squeak
it doesnt cause any problem with the products performance
they are a bit too small for my ears i guess
five stars for performance take away one for greed
it sounds cleaner and brighter
buy the pedal its great
just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go
once the input is active in software the light becomes green
i very much recommend it along with some dunlop straploks
if samson included software  itd be a 5 star product for me
warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15
this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings
this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio
the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins
the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything
i will be using this model and brand as long as they make them
this is a very good cable
some say dawdareeo deahdareeo dadareeoh or deeahdareeoothers shorten it to dadds or even daddyos
it is after all a cheap chinese stand
looks great feels great and works great
overall i think this capos a winner
it is also very easy to hold unlike the deans i have found
you simply will not find a negative thing about the zt lunchbox anywhere
fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great
im so proud of my balls
its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week
ive never had a problem and i wouldnt buy anything else
i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence
fold it up to take with me when i go out of town
very pleased with this purchase
light strong and very balanced
it was my fault not to check out its measurements before purchase
no problems with case or pedals
perhaps i wind up choosing this but so far eh
great speakers for portables like an ipod
after confirming the guitar was okay i tried a shorter cable which worked fine
no noise and very durable
this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look
this tu3 is easier to see and is more precise in its tunings
the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze
i may buy another set soon and restring the shortscale instrument with lights
its performance is minmax the same
i use delay pretty light n tight  slapback vibe not too wet
for metal its got great control of the distortion tone which sounds pretty good
maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit
it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name
i used this 3 times and it shorted out
i am extremely happy with this product
leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought
then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over
id been looking a taylors but didnt want to spend that much money
i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars
so thats a consideration if youre a beginner
this pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly
we found nothing negative that we could say about it
overall  im very pleased with this pick
just clip it on tap the big button and play a note
this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods
easy affordable fast why go out
i bought two more as presents
i like this very much and may well buy another
the auxillary jack is also a great addition
i bought my dad one too
i like it korg has never disappointed me
the shoulder rest is kinda useless though
it included a multiplug cable but not a right angle one
however when i set the guitar down for a moment i started hearing voices
i would buy them again
does not fair well when stored in non cooled area
amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc
100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist
im told it sounds better now
its a tool oil that stinks
its comfortable and fits my bass well
they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway
cons  lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast
the case is also very well balanced with the guitar inside
the push button action is most convenient vs
i just got my snark tuner and im very impressed with it
think of marshall cleans or even vox
unfortunately the top end isnt as defined as a at2035 or nt1a
what more could you ask
i have a mustang iii and it gets destroyed by the zt
i like playing it too
leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is
maybe thats what they mean by balanced tension
as a beginner these make much more comfortable
downloadable presets on the internetconsdistortions and overdrives are pretty meh
like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient
easy to use and makes changing out strings easy
because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks
monster cable is one of the things on earth we can count on
just as good as any 20 xlr out there
i would definatly purchase this again
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug
theres nothing to write about
i purchased this before i have ever changed a string
i like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with
elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar
ive seen and used some better cables but not at this price point
yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but its an amazing guitar
heavy duty and rugged it should last forever
love them and theyre good quality picks too so i will use them
i have an older model that i still use also
but my aggravations are really small ones
this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get
i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar
are there better tube screamer clones out there
i gave it four stars for that reason
has never failed me yet
using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical
it went together fast and is well padded
this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music
so i reckon each has to find their own
the pop sound is completely removed with the filter
ill keep it as a spare just in case anyway
i put these on a parker
sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or halfstep higher
my capos include bird of paridise paige and kyser
but im not certain these last so much longer
34quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations
ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos
other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price
this one came up in the specs of doing just that
they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures
powered usb hub in between
the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero
but they are kind of a pain
ill update this review when i find out just how long they do last
i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks
for at home but i really wouldnt recomend them for gigging too much
it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall
73mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career
they blend together beautifully when paying chords
i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin
2 its very sturdyan oftennoted feature of boss pedals
i have used daddarios since my earliest playing days
these hold up well taking a good bend and beating
i also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo
hence my purchase of these felt picks
no tone loss at all
this unit works as advertised
now my recordings are much more crisp
ive used many brand for my guitars for years
does a shock mount make a difference in sound
so maybe it is a good thing
actually while the amp is cheap its also fairly durable
i am going to purchase another one for my guitar
you receive 3 felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick
the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright
dont expect the fab series to be good at everything
it gets you in the ballpark but just barely
i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah
one of these should come standard issue with every guitar
this guitar i would recommend to anyone
its rugged well thought out solidly built and simple
ill just nip the ends off if i need to replace them later
tried other more expensive capos but this one is the winner
oh and not to forget
buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping
little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bit
bought one tried it on a pbass loved it
it would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons
first you guys who complain about the plastic housing
its also nice for cleaning
huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar
it holds tune and has not failed yet
now mine closes without pressure on the bridge
footswitch jack is on the front
the plate has five screw holes but doesnt look bad using 4
when the needle is dead center the string is tuner
i decided to give the dava picks a try
i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes
mics are like pants you have to find the right fit
i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it
no pickguard and it doesnt need one
they are very good strings worth the cost
ill probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that its intact this time
with drum pads i basically either get 0 velocity or max
the clean side of the amp is exactly that  very very clean
cutter works great winder makes the job really fast
but on a budget this mic is amazing
for value and use as a wee pa its a 5 star deal
very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites
5 starts totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal
i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect
i got two of them
fits my very old acoustic just right
i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there
hard to beat at that price
this tuner is nice  inexpensive and very easy to use
1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10
i think they might have made it a little more durable since then
its good but doesnt really cut it if you want a great wah sound
very solid clasps one of which locks
totally happy with service and product
keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential
however i am really liking them
this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound
all my guitars use this quick release clip
my fingers have stopped turning green proof that the product works
this product as advertised did not come with any picks
it works well hasnt broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned
black or red the color is the only difference
much easier  you dont need to select your tuning or anything first
the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily
compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well
you simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it
i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass
what we have here is an xlr male to xlr female black cable
but as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from martin
this pedal solved my problem with my amp
but if you really want to be amazed do an ab comparison
that is some stiff cardboard
who knows what real quality would cost these days
easy to setup easy to use
i wouldnt recommend these to anyone
the signal processing takes place in the unit not the pedal
i wrote to line6 and i got useless answers about
or heck even just a little better
so that meant my inexpensive tuner wasnt nearly discriminating enough
there was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke
well made reasonably priced as with most on stage stuff
the strap wouldnt hold my guitar any longer
easy to install and use and very reasonable price
it comes with light medium and heavy picks
good cable and has m et all of our needs
washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries
i bought another set for the ovation this time
this little tuner is very precise
and the string winder itself also works well
i mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments
second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it
it also wont stand evenly on end if thats important to you
so im out four bucks oh well
seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so
the board i received came supplied with plenty of softsided velcro
unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it
you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it
i would recommend this purchase to any one
well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed
the picks weight was perfect
a great simple idea that im glad someone put into production
this stand is a little difficult to open
these are great for all around playing
i was impressed at how much of is isnt plastic
but the sound is the problem
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys
try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid
i own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them
the sn8 is small  unobtrusive
i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new
i didnt like its tone so i uninstalled it
the satinfinished cedar top is very easy to marr
this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price
and the price was right
i like it but im just playing for entertainment and at church some times
the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other
schaller guitar strap locks work really really well
winder string cutter and end pin remover
i installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay and it lasts forever
and you get that rockstar feel throw picks at the audience
i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one
i have one in my main guitar caseses
it is simple practical and cheap
i havent tested the soundfeature but ive seen it on videos
it requires some finetuning to get it work on different guitars
it works got on time
for this kind of money you cant really go wrong
the shape is cool but id feel safer with it in a metal casing
this may sound silly but just to let you know you can do it
good price just as described
the seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days
does everything i want in a personal stage monitor
works solid looks solid and had a good price
the soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish
nope but it has some tricks up its leave for the price
should be able to stand up to any use or abuse
hey it does its job for a cheap price
i now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars
for under twenty dollars this pylepro mike cant be beat
good for fast strumming etc
i dont know if thats still the case
i just got done stringing them and they sound great
i also use it to intonate my guitar
i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation
the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up
now im not a professional but this is just my opinion
for years i have used a kyser capo because i like the trigger action
i always thought i was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned
im not sure why but it is very frustrating
nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated
this is a great package for beginners
both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for
one thing i didnt like was having reaper pushed on me
by far the best distortion pedal out there
an ipad mini would probably fit
i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit
i did like the style size and color
one less thing to tote
it is hours and hours of fun
it has more flexability than just a tone knob
but you cant expect to just plug it in and go
i am currently overseas and didnt want to bring my good guitar along
i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second
i have to say this string cleaner is a must have
i bought this to go with my super champ x2 combo
this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online
you simply play faster no matter what level you are
very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment
these are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well
these have always been my favorite strings and ive just about tried them all
i only wish that more came in a single pack
i have lots of friends who play these strings
a pop filter is essential
plus behringer is the best brand for pedals
this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected
i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more
rock metal shredding and even country
had no problems with this cable though
i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot
i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements
then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them
i loved it right out of the box
i couldnt get it to sound like i wanted it to
the these strings are fantastic
if youre a rockgod dont even consider this why would you anyway
this is a really nice sturdy pedal with a really warm tone
i employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortionsoverdrives
they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised
who plays his electric guitar daily
good leather good build made to last  and age nicely
once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was
that would make it easier to grab and use
these will work for soprano
its lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes
play some old kiss or some rob zombie
a terribly easy install and good quality straplock
works great with my baritone ukulele
however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one
it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most
boy did i hit a home run with that
what does this add to the others
as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall
it is not the size for mini guitar
id consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 14
enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
they are flexible but not flimsy
although the others have more features i like this little pedal
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around
with the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedaling
when i bought this i though it wouldnt be enough
i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast
nothing to special but it was good enough for that
these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics
just good ol genuine fender parts
think acdc and van halen to metallica
i am so happy with this amp
i tried other strings but i always come back to elixir
this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars
i added two stars to the product
3 the interface is clean an easy to use
i just appreciate a great value and daddario strings are just that
used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices
go to my website and look for it
super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered
i never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor
these cables are great in microphone or dibox applications
some players are comfortable with the stock speaker
i noticed immediate result after applying first time
however i think my rating will remain at 3 stars
the built in volume knob it a great tough
its really hard to beat this product for the price
i dont know what kind of strings are on it out of the box
now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore
their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover
so far for 200 bucks
i got this product to see if i could fix the problem
good buy for the money
great to have when friends come over to jam
i did and they love it
it arrived today and i decided to give it a quick workout
i believe it is 100 sturdy and reliable
having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere
built to last and it is a shure
the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out
or you have to find a case thats ultra thin
price cant be beat either
installation is not rocket science
i got a half dozen for christmas and was thrilled
with that said this thing sounds amazing directly after install
no for the nuts and bolts of the thing
this inexpensive delay is very special
this is a fine bag for a guitar i got it for my brother
but very good for a bag
it also lacks 14 plug one rca input you need an addapter
great little product and i would buy them again
very good price and looks like they will last awhile
ive had this for about 11 years now
the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone
attaches to my audio interface
i had previously owned it digitech jam man i also try the boss
think about it if you dont get it
what i like about this one is how the release lever works
can get all of the reverb sounds you want
it is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use
they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible
although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful
a good moderately priced guitar stand
when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry
overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
built to last and great price as well
perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable
it will give you a variety of bass tones
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
i didnt have near as much string stretch with these either
i replaced a 35 year old fender chorus with this
the extortion here is almost monster cable like
debatable  clip mechanism  not spring loaded
that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting
less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp
doesnt take a lot of space
why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac
arrived quick and before scheduled
they are clean of any electrical noise
i have bone on all of my guitars
good for my small space though
appearance  build  the loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures
they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order
i really like the durability and clear sound quality
this guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well
bass tones response and resonance are superior to my ear
easy to use and quality built
after im done the shine looks glassy and great
got this short cord to go from amp to waa
i dont think this is a true steel block
super excellent for dimly lighted rooms
they work in a variety of applications metal hard rock jazz blues reggae etc
first wax i have bought
this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as im concerned
tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well
on the packaging i dont like what daddario has done
it has several presets to emulate different sounds
and for its price its well worth it
they did nothing to help my overbraced 1970 gibson j50 though
i will not recommend to other musicians
i love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals
i imagine that they will last for years
conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically
turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger
gotta love those new external usb power nodes
but for this price why bother
there isnt much to say about this product except it works as advertised
lcd is bright and clear and needleish display works as expected
this is the newer version of the original snarks
always found the hangingtype to be the safest  most secure
i also have the software version of this effect on my daw
our son has four or more of them too
ive been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time
if you want 90 sound reduction however you will need a metal mute
this is a great invention
i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put
the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce
it may tend to overdrive a little bit
for the price you cant go wrong
now all i gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah
this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight
i do not like them
it just does it all and well
they improved the action considerably
the princeton amp emulation is sweet
every couple months i change something making upgrades
no transistor amp i own sounds as good
this was for a friend who needed a guitar capo
in that regard i give it five stars
i am going to replace all my old screws with these
the pitch black is nice and bold and bright
we never have problems with our monster gold cables
better than i imagined even with all the good reviews
i have a routine with mine
also this model is xlr only
intensity range seemed less than other pedals too
oh as stated elsewhere these dont have trussrods
this stand is built much better
one less power supply to hook up
the bullet style makes its easier to install
however as simple as it is it is definitely a useful tool
bought this for a friend
this is one of the best mics in this price range
got this tunermetronome as a replacement for a tuneronly model
bought this to use on my 1962 strat reissue
i  find the daddario strings will stay in better condition than others
for a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill
i does just what it should and for the price its pretty good
solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp
they sound good they are light weight
well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals
i was a bit disappointed in this gadget
my fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought
every musician should have one of these around
i bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar
it cuts the medal strings like butter
mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket
this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe
great all around mic used for vocals
works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises
but they will not screw down all the way and are losse
for the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck
i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised
these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable
id read some good reviews and 2000 isnt much money
this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought
fair to good wood materials and furniture good design
they have a really nice sound and dont cost an arm and a leg
it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument
im a huge fan of daddario strings
it saves time when restringing a guitar
mounts well but try to find a stud certainly
if you want a strap for 5 you cant expect the moon
if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect
the guitar now sounds great
i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes
when i unboxed this guitar i was floored
and it did but not at all the guitar contact points
the m68 gives the jimi a good run
they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range
this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while
i have found that everything schaller makes is grade a1 in my book
i got 2 of these for grandkids
this is my favorite go to tuner
for the price this is a wonderful strap
im gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp
and they all are super
if you really want to go for something a bit more 34marshall jcm900 like34
cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications
this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition
i ordered a ts 6v6 and am still waiting for it
ill report back if it doesnt happen again for a while
but thats an 80 custom shop pedal from mxr
the finish is a bit more orange than pictured
made of leather or highquality pleather so it seems builttolast
that doesnt make it worse or better just different
excellent bass response not muddy at all tight mids and clear highs
i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap
they last about twice as long
solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience
this pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out
little to no excess residue
electrified banjo mandolin or violin
i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner
the block is full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles
this is my favorite pedal
it appears to be indestructible
it sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it
so for the price you really get far more than you pay for
i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone
i have a vintage 60s dixon hummingbird
they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed
this is not my first planet waves locking strap
problem is i get nothing done because i cant put it down
need a all n one tuner buy this or an iphone
i doubt there is that much difference
a must have five star item
its really really an amazing program
i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget
especially for the price this is a great buy
worse even than the oils and acids on our skin
convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck
recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly
it is certainly an easy change
it pays to shop around
you can set the height always considering that your guitars dont reach the floor
provides good stability and displays guitar nicely
they also sound good with any settings i use
these daddario  strings are great
i wouldnt be surprised if they are made from china
this is what is giving the deeper sound
the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job
right now this amp doesnt need to be tweaked for me
i would imagine it weighs about 1014lbs
one out of 7 arrived doa and another has failed since
no pick noise just strings
as well as mute on every channel
my first concern was will this damage my guitar
this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does its job
this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm58
trick  treat your room with sound deadening
works well pretty straight forward
a little noisy  but what do you expect at this price right
these were purchased for my sons guitar
so far ive had no problems
this case it built really well it has really nice plush interior
yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard
65 deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model
the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to
absolutely tickled with the look and performance
and theyre fender so how can you go wrong
comes with a decent hard case and sweet shock mount
i admit it my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick
id even pay a lot more for them
if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets
in my opinion this is the best guitar volume pedal available
i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio
we will see how long they last
i got a superb machine for the money
the main problem with this tuner is the usability
it arrived earlier than i expected
these are fairly pricey but i am very impressed with the quality
all in all its a nice little capo
i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap
you get what you pay for
just dont put too much weight on it while using it
i was going to get a pink furry one
this thing is way smaller than i expected
i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash
as you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine
i cant imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself
maybe i should get that for cheaper
as i indicated i have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol
it works great for me i like this type of straps simple  durable
it is such cool and easy rest for the guitar
i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc
i play bass with these and they have a unique tone
this seems like a nice product but maybe im doing something wrong
the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus
it also has that vintage fender coolness factor
i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price
i have two of these
it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand
some may like the martins but few wont love the aquilas
25 stars rounded up to 3
i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen
the capo looks nice and works without any problem
in fact it may be overkill
its poorly made with attention to detail
classical and acoustic steelstring guitars are also a tad problematic too
select your material select your weight and youre done right
i dont this is it for meat least not on acoustic
it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced
man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy
you adjust this right on the jam using a roller dial
it was an exceptional guitar for which i paid 125
this thing was over a hundred dollars
i bought mine from austin bazaar
this will work fine for me i think
after the first tuneup of the strings it stayed in tune
well those reviewers were right  the pitch correction function has no effect
whats also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included
the cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew
these strings arent anything fancy but they sound great
but the sound was horrible
tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available
they really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar
this mxl is usbonly 4448 only
for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect
the dava changes that for me
these are fantastic and unique guitar picks
it is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well
these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well
always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing
too loose and deep so i increased the setting to 3 and repeated
and the thing is loud
this makes the process so much easier
i dont think that many people would do this
any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive
these cables seem to be qualitymade
however with this price i wouldnt complain at all
no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly
try them youll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy
i will not buy anther one
i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech
the apogee jam works great and it sounds great
i would recommend having it around just for that
fyi  dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp1101 as part of his live rig
louder focused and projects much better  almost resonatorlike
stamina mode is supposed to run for 11 hours
this amp is packed with features
i love these picks especially in this gauge
will need to check them next week or so
awesome little untreated polishing cloth
it has tuned them all very well
case  arrived in great condition
yes these strings are amazing
stay away from this one and get a better used pedal
this pedal was priced very well 32 and had nearly a 5 star rating
its not fancy but its well though out and you cant beat the value
this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but its gone now
this dual splitter works perfect
the only way to turn it off is to unplug it
i have installed a set i got 8 and it sounds really good
im very pleased with this purchase
pretty deluxe strings for the price here on amazon
awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer
i would definitely buy this again
thats a winwin in my book
winds the strings fastpulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wiredoes not scratch my guitar
if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be 5star strings
ive got several guitars and capos  this one is not too bad
senneheisers evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look
after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube
i gave one to my grandnephews
finally a product that is as simple to use as a pointandshoot camera
i am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with
or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
its heft heavy and feels well made
hard to say it just indicates high  low  on pitch really
its great just like its advertised
really you hate warm sustaining naturaltube overdrive you wont like it at all
i would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical
not a huge deal if youre using a standard mic clip
the only issue was with some manufacturing detail
it can get loud enough over drums etc
i havent had any problems with them at all so far
the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable
replacement pads can be bought on amazon
wish i discovered these years ago
i also have a more expensive capo just like this one
you dont need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt
it is a quality heavy cloth case with a feltvelvet lining
holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps
this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument
a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat
then i went to daddario strings
very good for the price
i have used it in recording live band practice sessions
what more can you ask for at roughly 2500
all of the cables worked perfectly
if youre into that sort of thing
if you have one or many expensive guitars buy these
the first is that the finish is not as good
these are very nice looking guitar picks
yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for
comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding
highest quality guitar ive ever seen in this price range
we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost
being toneprint enabled is a 100 plus
definitely would purchase again solid quality build
it totally deserves 5 stars
im kind of feeling my way
i have been using them for 10 years and have never seen one fail
i mean you pay for a quality instrument right
that is not the case
ok all thats good so why am i disappointed in this unit
i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be
in general is does tend to get a little noisy though
the quality of construction is absolutely superb
i installed reaper and immediately disliked its interface
wipe them down with a little dr
combine that with the great product design and im a happy customer
im glad i bought it and would buy from the company again
otherwise 5 star all the way
175 for a roundback is really a no brainer
ive been using the blue tortex picks for about 14
maybe the maxon made version
perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad
that counts for the gig bag too
i only use the clean side or input one
this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to
i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it
well here are is the long term 100 secure solution
when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy
the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar
i was using a nylon strap before i got this one
very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic
you get 30 days to register it
it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger
it doesnt seem to affect the playability
i recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have
i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments
it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks
the fender vibro champ is a great little amp
my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets
he thought the guitar cost 300 above
the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar wont fall off
i suppose it is the best choise for your kid
they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty
ive been using this brand of strings for years
it feels sturdy not that i would drop it
the entire tuner clipped onto the instrument
this stand is very stable and easy to put together
it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself
i play my ipod through a small guitar amp
this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning
violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem
things that i liked 1
this is just what the doctor ordered
our tips  cd sales have gone way up
the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall
i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar
like a perfect marshall but with more organicness
something like this really should last at least a year or more
this pedal is very easy to use
it is great and i kinda like the great look
very very good tune result
it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly
its an important component in my studio
the cable material is very bendable and easy to work with
they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics
ive used the sd1 with both singlecoil and doublecoil pickups
i also dont care for the color coded rings on the strings
ive tried other passive volume pedals that didnt work
using this for a prs electric guitar with satisfactory results
it truly does have true bypass and logical controls
battery life is also pretty good
i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary
i did the length first then thickness and finally the height
it has a switch for zerolatency monitoring of whatever is coming in
speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces
none has ever failed me so far
i like its texture and the size
one of my favorite picks ive tried for electric
i bought this one after using the sn2 for 5 months
great deal for the price
i sing fairly low and airy  works great for me
if your guitar has polypropylene finish which most do youre going to be fine
i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument
this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88key keyboard
its also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db1w1m
they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise
still if youre looking a softerthanplastic pick this is the one to get
works great  keeps all my fretboards looking great
if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars
i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build
you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings
i changed this for a tc electronic polytune
i have not used the pick holder yet
they are used by other artists that approve of them
have three of these hercules hangers
i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc
does the job for now
i almost feel like i wont even need strap locks its so good
053 strings in both phosphor bronze and 8020 bronze
this fender is lots better then my other bag
oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills
sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune
it really does react to your playing style
it is limited in what it can do but it does the job
mine was shinynew and was an absolute perfect fit on my mexistrat
needed a pre amp tube for my hartke lh500 and ordered one of these
this one is too slow for the stage
i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember
this is a great little item
they are bright and feel really good on my hands
works great for my acoustic dreadnought
i loved the orange crush but it was totally unreliable
but the instructions say it should be fine
this pedal works with the yamaha motif that was my main concern when ordering
as expected for a beginner
this pedal is outstanding for the price
i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall
an allinone guitar tool that is a musthave for any guitar case
i recommend it to all aspiring musicians
simple solution to a simple problem
been using these cables for three months now
what more can you ask for out of a drink holder
anyway the pickup sounds very nice and im happy
i dont like them at all
and yeah new 4 strings do improve the sound on a 20 uke
so far the tuner is very accurate
also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order
this makes the unit useless
these are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong
the battery drains like a mf
i love this thing and for the price you just cant beat it
the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel
stay away dont fall victim to the noob hype
i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance
but even its ability to take some distortion is pretty good
the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good
about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster
this stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle
just not what i needed in my particular situation
theyre durable and have a long battery life
its a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases
good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups
definitely got what i wanted
its built for the long haul
light weight easy to carry
just thoughtyou ought to know
there are exactly as described and do the job
i have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here
it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue
all that said here is why i decided to write a review
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy
this is an awesome amp
it will mess up the finish
no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going
the first one worked great and so does this one
gerlitz makes this wax easy not greasy
im glad i did because its really great
this is my second makala gig bag
its well worth the noney
this tuner is very accurate
the green cable is good for that
this time i got a 3 pack of ej163d light
overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3
those work well for acoustic
i really dont have anything more to say about it
ill definitely be buying more of these
really glad i tried it out
i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews
just suck it up and buy a shure sm58
mmm i would still highly recommend using an audible metronome
well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that
it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow
in my opinion this is a five star product
so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper
very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows
still they play so well its worth the cost of regular replacement
i had alesis io2 express which did a similar job
no desire to test other strings
i will never use strap locks again after trying these
the spring tension is just right
it makes the stuff i do in logic easy
ive been using it for a few weeks and im extremely happy with it
that being said i have to admit that these picks are very high quality
no noise or hum whatsoever
would reccommend this for voice or instrument use
but its held together fine so far and ive had it for weeks
this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together
the tuner works like a champ
notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc
leaks a bit while using  so dont stand under it
i love these carry bags
i really like the stability of the one i bought
i am using this on my martin 12string
the bench is comfortably padded and very affordable
the foam is good and the hardware is included
ive tried kyser capos and theyre good
i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs
ill prob use it with my upgrade
its very inexpensive needs a little work sounds very good
yes its made of plastic but you cant expect any more for 25
these mikes sound almost identical the b 2000 and the shure sm
it is essentially three parts  the base and two removable arms
the only downside is the same as with most capos
as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money
now a word about open back banjos if you are considering this stand
well they were right it sucks
im not ashamed of having chinese clones on my board
i would buy this again or recommend to anyone
the capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well
these seem fine to me
you disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods
the shubb works great on both
a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin
cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks
i recommend if you need a winder just buy this
ive owned this pedal for about 8 years
ive never had a problem with these patch cables
typical of quality control in the peoples republic of china
try to keep the sponge moist when its dry
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at2020 yes
but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done
its pretty basic but really good for a beginner
good strings for my electric guitar
its very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over
send them back until you get a perfect set
for 100 usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for
padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable
i did this drawing on my guitarplaying knowledge
this cable expands the capability of the onespot or godlyke 9v adapter
this tuner works by guitar vibration
it does what its supposed to do
nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all thats needed
even the case impressed me
i love the size and wouldnt want anything larger
for the price i paid cant beat what i got
i do mixing and voice overs so i needed the real deal
im not grading the switch on that
this with my behringer xm8500 is perfect
for such a little thing
i will replace with 12s however
it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins
for the price i would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one
my new guitar had only the back strap connector
ive owned loop stations dm4s jam mans samplers and all that jazz
i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over
buy them you wont be sorry
played for a half hour and retuned sounded better
medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people
ive been using the mxl990
this strap was very well designed and thoughtout before going to manufacture
getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended
for what this does you cant go wrong for the price
for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track
works amazing in fl studio
i figured id buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one
the stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things
thanks for taking care of me
its performance look and feel are great
should of just forked over the money for an ae
bottom line  a great toy
the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves superhandy elastic cord wrap
the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it
but the rub is their nonadaptability
it is accurate reliable for tuning and affordable
the line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier
for 300 you can get a vox w an overdrive delay and reverb
we are just playing for the love of it
its a tipnegative polarity and the privia requires a tippositive polarity
one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place
as far as battery life goes you can get them right on amazon
good replacement for iffy tuners
material is rougherbut thats a good thing
i thought i had found my pick
they have different wood grains
first set one red plated slightly
maybe its my signal chain
thats just how it is
the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again
i have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings
great for beginners or the pros
the action is fairly high not uncommon with offtheshelf instruments
you really cant go wrong with this pamonitor
i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings
i also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument
buy if you need a stand
the classic fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth
however it worked fine and gets the job done
i shall probably order more from this company in the future
you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes
but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent
perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest
for the future i am not so sureabout me
not quite perfect but a good value for the money
im impressed with these exp16 guitar strings
just make certain you get the height correct so your action isnt too high
009s might be intimidated by
i have seen people complain about battery life
now thats a fun king wah wah
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams
i put these strings on every acoustic i own
recommended just remember the price point and you wont be disappointed
the old one had a lot of handling noise
had to return the first one
it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use
in my experience this model is inferior
that is supposed to last longer than average strings
it has good lenght between two plugs
as beginner these strings were not good for me
the holes work with my strap buttons okay
doesnt short out on you
for an in expense product
i always use ernie ball on everything
attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product
dont put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years
whats not to love about these strings
if youre looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz this is the pedal you need
not all uke players use straps some do and some dont
the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer
it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones
its a well build daisy chain dc power cable
multi color and easy to use
i find the elixir excellent
i plugged it into a small guitar amp
they are easier to bend too which is great
the foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals
obviously i think it a good product
im running 365vdc on the plates and 340vdc on the screens
i burn through one or two cm100l per semester
celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i dont
everything else in the other 9volt 100ma slots
but once on it is great
i also use the ghs standard
very light which is nice
so in that regard i prefer planet waves cables
its well laid out and easy to get to all the settings
if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device
i stink at writing drums
went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand
the digitech bad monkey is one such example
the switch on that one isnt as good as the behringers
hence the purchase of the pedaltrain mini
im no expert but these strings sound good to me
it does 80s hair band and 80s metal very well
of the lot the shure sm7b is my favorite of the ones still available
it comes with really nice looking stickers
the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesnt work very well
turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well
construction is about as good as i would normally get on a 13 item
ive had good success with this piece
this is my new favorite tuner
rhythmic u2 delays are usually around 350450 ms
its a must have for guitarist with multi effects
just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me
for the money you cant find a better deal
does what it is designed to do it holds about 6 picks
playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine
tunes all my instruments fast and easy
the bands on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job
these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing
i have a barber ltd which does that beautifully
the jf02 is truly my favorite right now
holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well
to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed
i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results
they sound so full and strong
its too narrow at 17 inches
the thin soft gold 510 microns
be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less
i was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar
i bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar
i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault
i ordered two of this item on 0318
i play professionaly and this is the best thing ive gotten in two years
have to try them more and with other amps
i am in afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by
i had issues with the packaging
i have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio
it is dead ballson accurate quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight
the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guidescovers and provide good strain relief
pretty darn good in every way
changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better
good tone though does the trick trick
as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone
these are slightly shorter than other stands i have
havent popped one outa my fingers yet
great bag well padded the shoulder strap is nice
amazon is great to deal with
good deal on this package of patch cords
it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me
it has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents
please memorize this  chandler guitars pickguard heaven
awesome for chord based songs
on my resonator these provide a full loud sound
you turn on the echo pedal
arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger
not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however
i have to say it works very well for the price
my ukulele has a better tone with these strings
you can now plug it into the wall
great little mixing console for home use and practice
this is a great effect
had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented
do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument
the fab overdrive pedal does not work well for me
they are a little flimsey but are ok
the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips
the plate was delivered on time and as promised by amazon
theyve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house
black tortex picks with silver lettering
gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick
these are great xlr cables
this mic fits my studio need perfectly
fender makes a nice standard pick
i still own at least of each
gls makes a great product for musicians on a budget
recommend to someone need replace cable jct
would i buy it again
and it does make some noise in my chain
nothing too spectacular about them
this power supply is unbelieveble versatile
i would recommend it for light to moderate use
these are my favorite strings
this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well
i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these
they cost a little more than this
and note that unlike what you may read in another review they are adjustable
touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys
this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up
they have 34punch34 and 34snap34 which are good things to have in a bass
in summary daddario makes good strings and these are no exception
its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro
i got it because i need a second tuner
if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference
so especially for the lead guitarist this should be a major selling point
i like the light guage
fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate
im a basement rockstar  the mustang gets it done without any problems
it was inexpensive and fun to use
but the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it
in the studio i wont use this pedal for that reason
i really like the mediums
its just a matter of attention to detail
a must have for any blues player
im sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound
i run compression wah overdrive superoverdrive delay  reverb pretty much in that order
then again they might make all the difference in the world
for 2500 it a pretty useful pedal
now i have it put away and im using this one
but not bad and i was using a sensitive rode condenser
i love this little tuner
all tube build in effects and line and speaker out
my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job
after trying to use it i promptly returned it
what more can i say
my only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough
other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside
iif the strings break i will try this one gs330s as well
but this isnt advertised as a clean boost pedal
i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature
i purchased this item sometime in august and think its pretty good
one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass
the shortcomings were huge but the convenience meant that they were tolerated
update  121912still working great after 5 months
this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there
the device is simple and fairly solid
in summary 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service
i use it a lot on my practice rig
i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks
these strings really are special
skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc
this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid 4999
however the hot tubes completely transforms that tone
but not quiet up to par
no reason to be out of tune with these tuners
i would definitely recommend this
im old school when it comes to these boxes
i added a clip on led light as well
and the result sounds really right
i decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings
the instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps
this is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should
so ive become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar
we bought three of these and they are just great
they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones
this pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy
i would recommend them to all
what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings
but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one
i bought two more you will love this tuner
this is my first noise reducer
gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether
so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest
spend some more money if you want something good
im truly surprised by all the good reviews here
this is a very good piece of equipment for its price
a 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the back
pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2
and they were right about that
to brigthen the sound a tad
people cant belive its a 50 dollar mic when i tell them
none of them work as good as i would like
they sound similar to the shure sm58 and we use them every day
it does all of them well
never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp
placing after the distortion pedal sounded better
they hurt my ears so clean
my disappointment is with the sound
especially considering the price these are brilliant
the natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrified
great at eliminating feedback in a live setting
ive owned it for a while now and havent had any problems with it
the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories
the same is true of a lot of audio gear
is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy
high quality hassle free design
this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping
so far i am very impressed
it hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out
it is a fuzz pedal
the device works as advertised
this is what the black ice delivers
if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing dont worry
it more than lived up to my expectations
the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun
the strap is strong and well made
works for me in fact i bought another for my classical
my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it
05034 found on gibons and espltds
overall i like the design and flexibility
durable affordable easy to grasp and use
much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries
if so you can stop reading
you will not be dissappointed at all
not sure i would buy these again
this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap
the pro line shures also hold their value well
i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles
i also wish that this specific came in another color other than black
doesnt hold as many pick as i expected
been giggin since the early 70s and have been hosting an openmic to boot
but its sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job
and ive certainly seen quite a few worse
good life they sound good for a couple of months
it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box
i did buy some more expensive magami ones and i cant tell a difference
i always play sitting so height is not a consideration for me
i do like the built in pick holder
i do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck
i am finally feedback free
compact design on stand and folding for travel
the lights started flashing and it got hot
for the price this product is ideal
the tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings
they work great for me
do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure
anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have
my testing is ongoing and cannot give the elixir a top rating yet
the tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great
but that is a minor complaint
now it is easier to handle when trying to play
i change strings every two weeks
it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch
no more hunting for picks anymore
all in all a super amp
wellconceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks
i have to lug an 88key weighted piano around so dont mind lugging this
doubt ill use the strap
im a beginner so im not very picky on the accessories yet
went through two of these before i learned my lesson
it winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter
this little amp has a belt clip
for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start
that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use
hope it goes away soon
shipping was great along with packaging
this produces a much less bright more muted sound
it helps him remember to practice when he sees it
the fret does not have any issue at all
otherwise its a good option at a good price
pop one of these in
i set up a shootout in my studio
i wasnt totally blown away either
im used to conventional steel finger picks
i will be buying more in the future
great little amp just not for me
i did work very well and was strong
ive used the fx600 for a couple of years
im a bass player and so i dont deal with cut picks much
the mxr phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units
the boss pedals however were hit or miss
i get better harmonics with these strings as well
very quality recordings so far
and high praise for godps music
all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works
just sitting on two other speakers
they were twice as loud as these
there is also a 14 line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment
i got it earlier then expected and i love it
i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets
nothing gets 5 stars  there are no generals present
very light so i leave it on when i play
my reviews for this have changed a few times but no more
this is a great price for the package
its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength
i bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar
at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder
ive had it on for 2 and a half months now with no problems
what a great multipurpose guitar tool
gaskets can take care of that
and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i havent tried yet
been using these for years
there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm
i just really like the look feel and features of this smart design
do i get a fortune cookie with that
sound great play great feel great tune great
its great for beginners or experts alike
it has two brightness settings
i am 66 years old and have been playing guitar for over fifty years
but when i turn pro ill get something better
change the strings every couple of months
as close to a rack mount as it gets
i loaded them up anyway
the lower settings are bluesy  the higher settings are bright and dynamic
i just got mine today and tried it out
i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board
either way dunlop is the best and for a great price
the cables are very long maybe too long if thats possible
would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice
one can find info about mandolin setup on the web
again someone will chime in and bash me for saying this
build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation
this was exactly what i needed this being the 3rd compressor i bought
you cannot go wrong with this mixer
good strings i would recommend them
okay they are not high end but i didnt need high end ones
gls cables are quality cables at a good price
i would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black
this is the second one i have and it works well
the xlr male  the xlr female are well built
overall im extremely pleased with my purchase
no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it
please just try a set of aquilas and you will hear a major difference
my only complaint is that it could be smaller
works the way its supposed to
awesome with my ltd vc401 with 59 and jb pickups
some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to 35db
the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars
this is good for the money
baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names
from nasty blues to steppenwolf you will have it covered
it worked great for about 46 months and then broke
id order again if i had to
this is unlike any pedal i have played
i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound
something about eb strings they really are slinky  whatever that means
my eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo
ill probably be buried with one in my hand
my guitar now stays in tune better than my prs and epiphone
you dont bend your finger to play slide
im just running out of wall space and money for new guitars
very handy to have two picks with you at all times
was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat
this makes sliding on the bass real smooth
the behringer for example was hardwired to its cable
i really and suprisingly like this little gadget
i know people who have the marshall and the fender
i just requested a returnexchange from amazon
im really happy with this daddario purchase
but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright
i just plug in and everything sounds magical
made me able to use a strap on my guitar
a classic mic clip  simple inexpensive and durable enough
the leather is rather soft
they are easy to install on the bass and the strap
it is a solid well built guitar
now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it
so now i get brighter colored ones
its adjustable with a pick pocket simple good quality would by another
for 2000 it is worth all day
its a good quality strap and i have three of them
awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere
for the money this is a tremendous pedal
it is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open
using speakon cables mono to each speaker to speaker for easy mixing
there are several types of practice amps
it was also just noisy in the pedal chain
its not muddy and very clear
the tone last longer than any other string and they dont break on me
i keep various guitar picks clips pencils etc
as easy as the little round ones from snark
they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic
but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more
it was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners
the soft case is very nice also
second its 15 watts and is pretty darn loud
makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again
have been for the last 30 years
daddarios nyxl1046 nickel plated electric guitar strings i have the light are the best
havent noticed any hum or crackles
this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm
june 15 2010 update  elixir is a wonderful company
nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick
and they tune with amazing accuracy
im sure theyll use it often
the string cutter is very handy
it is firm secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla
they are great for jamming with friends  are so user friendly  accurate
it makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy
i keep a stack of
what im getting at is you get what you pay for
this is a very comfortable strap
these things are so great
tension is perfect for my washburns
well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one
this keeps me from adjusting my amp each time i switch guitars
but come back to these every time
will i continue using the product
it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on
also was the last to pick it up for 11850 shipped to my door
however its the attention to small construction details that i love
in practical terms no not for this sort of item
definitely top notch if this is what you are after though
i also like the fact that theres no logo on the outside
great strings for just a little more
it doesnt sound exactly like a vox  but i dont gig
to get those flawless professional sounds
it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time
the ucg102 runs on an asio driver
the nine leds really light up my music stand
the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure
dont know if their qc has gone downhill or what
the only complaint ive heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight
the only things i dont like are 21each of the corners has a cap
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks
strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost
it also makes you looks professional
i like these well enough that i have four of them
if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs6
about 2 weeks later i had a new cable
restringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread
and they are absolutely right
good quality seem durable enough
they will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x
perfect for hanging displaying your guitars
what can you say about a guitar chord
i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake
a bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good
i have had multiple mistakes and frustrations
you can do partial capos with this one
for the adjusting screw stand fullsizedfor 20 bucks
placed one in a fender blues junior
it works for me perfectly
it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians
i just love it now
if you are careful it offers good protection
construction seems to be pretty good
its really cheap product but it works really well
i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies
but i think the electroharmonix tubes sound better therefore they do
i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions
the back panel also has a 14 inch jack line out
i am very pleased with the price and the quality
i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same
heres what it is  an exceedingly wellconstucted amazingly playable guitar
otherwise youll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup
almost didnt know what it was because of this
if you play a string instrument this one is a must
i would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication
if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise
i didnt put it down for a couple of weeks
imho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording
no power cord was included in mine or manual
heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be
for a long time i never thought much about guitar strings
these really are the best tuners out there  you should get one today
i love the sound of this pedal
i purchased this for my love of playing guitar
no metallic hiss youd normally expect
and if youre not careful it may find a permanent home
these really do work great
there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches
i dont find changing strings that big of a bother
well i guess it works
not from music123 it doesnt
every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig
it gets one less star because of the california prop 65 warning
my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand
it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it
i have a taylor ga4e
thought the guitar is beautiful ive had it for a while
its an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type
there may be a concern about damage to certain finish
in rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful
i have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work
the black dunlop has a nice smooth finish
my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case
they were direct drop ins
worth every penny as long as it lasts
i think its the way they trail off
ive owned several multieffect pedals in the past even one digitech
for such a low price you cant go wrong
for me this pedal was a great way to do that
i have all the volume i need and great tone
the other quality thats noticeable is sustain
did i mention this thing is freggin huge
also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it
the g2s seem to resonate everywhere
one issue is that this is not a plugandplay device
it is part of my regular arsenal
over the years ive tried literally dozens of capos
i liked it from the very first tuning
it came well padded and was in excellent shape
its like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends
the electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing
it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke
and the snark sn6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church
great for everything from slapback to long delay with heapbig repeats available
have several tuners of different names and quality
i will be buying more for all my guitar cases
the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use
caps are marked 223k so looking that up they are 0022uf
yeah i know touch screens are cool
this dunlop ergo pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar
in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input
i love the price and they last me quite a while
people ask is it loud enough to gig with
durable yet lightweight and sturdy
this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner
if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic
i use the dunlop tortex 114mm purples
just go for the gusto and find what you like
im still waiting on the return for this
the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel
its really like magic in a can
fits straps locks just fine
my only complaint is i didnt like the clean sounds not to my liking
im also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast andor recording audiobooks
would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti
i played it all but 2 weeks until i got bored and stopped
i bought this to replace a behringer uca202
todays modern guitars use medium jumbo frets
i keep it in my guitar case and use it often
how much can you say about a patch cable
for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient
id guess they have about 100 years of wear on them
lasts a good long while
use the crybaby with other effect pedals the uses are endless and fun
and if you blast your music the low end distorts
it felt really small at first and i kinda was dissapointed
that just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time
i use it and my granddaughter uses it as well
oh maybe a tiny bit
i have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years
my curiosity didnt end there though
i wanted a third guitar just for kicks
the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit
just pop filtering through black pantyhose
but it has the star for grip and that is super
they are good for strumming
adding to that is its convenient small size and being unbelievably cheap price
yes its a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound
i use this on all my guitars
rough handling will probably break it
i own three other behringer pedals as well and theyre still going strong
it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way
when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection
the strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots
nice and stable for my classical guitar
i highly recommend planet waves cables
thank u guys your pedals really kick butt
and the price makes it a real bargain
everythings been working and sounding great thus far
the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip
ive mostly used it with the default settings
give these picks three days and youllnever go back to another style
update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer
mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective
the red color is a metallic color  and i totally dig it
dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface
after applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable
this stand feel sturdy and strong
keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size
its fun to use and also very challenging
the part that holds the music isnt as wide as other stands
great quality and i would definitely buy them again
these tuners are just awesome
its very soft and padded as well as anti static
it is solid yet flexible in height and angle
these cables arrived in good working condition and weve been using them continuously since
terrific strings for the price of cheapies
pretty disappointed in the color
purple ones with the turtle500 on them
the padding is better that i expected
sounds great right out of the box and plays well
oh well just shows me little by little more and more things arent anymore
it works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments
i am an acoustic guitar addict
turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see
a snug fit for the pod hd 500
i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space
will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had
i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts
hosa makes some other products that have good value
fender has done an amazing job with this amp
all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase
im on my second us600 pedal after the first one broke
i can definitely see this being heavy roadgig worthy
gonna have to send this back
im extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound
if you try playing clean with no distortion youll be underpowered
it fits the guitar perfect and is easy to adjust
the lowend on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm
this string set offers typical daddario quality and value
both by vibration and mic
all in all this is a great guitar strap
now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want
great for linking closequarter effect pedals
tuning is a breeze and is very stable
they hold their tones longer
i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little
ive been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago
switches and knobs feel sturdy
the guitar has good tone and action
the fit of the headphones is big for me
these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag
i believe it was x
at this point i give it 2 thumbs up
i recommend for use of  1
this is a well built and high quality product
so i picked these up
i have found this to be true
i thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk
id owned a phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one
it is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings
i wasnt planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar
so testing on their own mics
you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly
however im not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic
im unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it cant be undone
is comfortable as this type of strap can be
there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use
its cheapit worx what more to say
i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side
the price was great and quality was awesome
really quick to setup and use
i dont remember who makes what strings for what companies though
now that ive learned how best to use it ill keep it
the second one i tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage
and gotten the 12 channel one
also they werent as large as i expected
arrived as expected and as described
this one works better than anyone i have tried
as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove
using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder
but no room to spare
nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners
fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording
all in all though very good for the price
solid tuner more accurate than i anticipated and very easy to use
battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks
well the hunt is over
but with the string and bone upgrades i cant imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic
the keys were of course inside the case
if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet
didnt have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size
on the strings lasting longer thats hard to say
thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk
the one lone tube in the micro terror is the preamp tube
i use mine for practice at home and for lowvolume band rehearsals
they have been very dependable and easy on batteries
tons of character and tone
i bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room
recommended if you are doing the beginner thing and testing the waters
i am thinking about getting a 2nd one
the price is right as well
i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners
for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile
very functional and easy to work with
will order again if needed
bottom line  this is a fantastic 5star device
would recommend these for folks on a budget
but i prefer the walker williams brand
its go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel
the tc electronics ditto pedal will not disappoint
this is just like any other microphone stand
these sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report
i recommend them to do the job for the
made in germany  not china  these locks are fast and secure
or are you know how to use capo
the trigger is a rocker switch
easy to use and economical product
ive been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel
i have used it on mandolins guitars violins and violas and double bass
you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise
smooth tone the right amount of gain perfect to push a tube amp
the frets are properly aligned and the instrument stays in tune
this pedal is great only a couple notes i should make about it
a day doesnt go by where the stand is not in use
this was a terrific deal
how far wrong can you go for 183
im a little surprised at this one
this is a good product
angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well
the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic
i see that some of the other reviewers disagree
i prefer the cactus picks
just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned
wow for the size this is amazing
i would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal
pick up a used one
the picks work well and they dont wear out easily
i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive
its just an imperfect design
ill wait and see how they hold up in the log run
the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus
enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees
works great on voice overs singers and rappers
it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg
my advice  dont even install the app from the included disc
its good for a laugh
the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel
the switch should be on the side of the unit
so its back to the fenders
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it
they made it sound even better than it was
made in china it says
small enough to fit on any pedalboard
built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage
if your looking for a studiohome1st amp you cant go wrong with this guy
th only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere
these are solid strings that never let me down
i will experiment with different instruments  write more about the quality later
these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price
to me 1520 is way too much for a guitar hanger
its much easier to play than the squier and it has a better sound
having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks
i like the multiple display options and calibrations
just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this
the mustang 1 was a great buy for another great fender product
it looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar
trust me your money is best spent elsewhere
is it valuable as such
and the price it right
you cant beat the price
making you work on your technique and become a better player
20 plus years and still working
the tuner workss as advertised
this is a must for black guitars
and it was necessary to the group
an investment in your musical future
this seems like a good deal for the price
easy to hold and very soft
i enjoy playing this thing so much
you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube
73 for acoustic and the same holds true
i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes
and the lace patriot red silver and blue value pack
do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one
they all work and none of them have given any trouble
awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life
it takes care of business just fine
other then that i like it and purcheased a second one
once in place it stays there with no slipping
all three of my kids have a guitar
i love how they sound and they are built well
the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way id hoped
the pinstripe heads are amazing
try the behringer cs400 for more sustain
but no harm done still works great
like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material
ive found that the light picks
and the noiseless feature is priceless
as a conclusion im really pleased with the quality of the digitech cm2
its a very worthwhile purchase
i could use a brighter light
this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player
this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified
i held out from trying the boss sd1 super overdrive for many years
without the update this tuner was borderline terrible
count each chord as 123  456
you cant go wrong with aquila
i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner
small price to pay to be in tune
pluck a string and let it sit and it slowly cleans up
i like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease
i am sure i received a new case
this is a substantial stable very solidly built stand
but this is my fault i should have read the 1 star review first
i kept the switch because of the quality
these are very good longlasting strings
both arrived together and at the expected delivery date
it can hold quite a bit of weight
ive tried many others but always come back to ernie balls
i just got it today and havent spent too much time with it yet
nice hardware on this case
i like its simplicity and reliability
the only problem i have is it smells terrible
it doesnt hold very many picks but it really doesnt have to
this is fine as a general stickon inexpensive pick holder
it sounds awesome and is built like a tank
these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys
if youre a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration
my only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for amazon prime
then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick
however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise
i may not even need that focusrite box now
i put it on the boom of my mic stand
i love the pads and the knobs
i would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap
i already own two and had no problems
with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it
are you guys really hearing anything
the first time i and everybody else saw one i said wow
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well
just wish it was more like a fender pic finish
but otherwise a wise and good purchase
very pleased always have a spare pair in your case
this pedal does exactly what my title suggests
finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem
i havent swapped tubes or the speaker  its completely stock
some people say they are too slick
certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it
other reviews had complained about a toolow action
this was a great addition to our studio here at
this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length
it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well
but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the twoband eq
took it on vacation so i didnt have to leave my axe at home
has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition
got these stands to hold my guitars they are o
i use a lot of behringer equipment and no i dont work for behringer
luckily that was no mere marketing jive
this is one of its best features
it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever
theyre better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers
the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool
an old school delay that works very well
the tool works great and is sturdy
i run this direct to my digital recorder
no cheap way is there
this is a future classic
work well to stop pops and lisps
mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014
one of the best purchases ive made for the money
that way i can shuffle through the presets with one stomp
it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have
this gls mic cable is working well
terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly
the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin
this was the first time i ventured into the world of harp
they are not too big or too small
soon i will be in the market for an upgrade
i have not used it yet so i cant say much
i own the old ibanez ts9 that i modified to the original keeley specs
these tuners just seem ok to me
after extensive research and listening i decided on the maudio bx5a deluxe
i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar
i am using it for a dj karaoke system i do recommend it
and shouldnt recording be fun and not frustrating besides
so it was very much a lovehate relationship
on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy
nice features on a pedal this cheap
i currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate
it is want i need for travel
great tuner for the price
then this will make transporting it easy
this cable seems like it will last me for a while
it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style
the sound is unbelievable especially at this price
i just wish it had a power switch
my current one i bought in july and so far everything is holding up
i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones
along with a few high end guitars i also have a few beaters
i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these
i am so psyched that i found this microphone its perfect
then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub
i will update this review when i have that information
i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well
the idea here is to sound loud without being loud
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty
and also for the money a great deal
exactly what i needed at a great price
it wont give you the brown sound
only drawback  there is no volume control on the instrument itself
an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal
seem good not legendary and tremelowhammy standard zinc block theres the must upgrade part
a lot of players say you have to have a set glued neck
i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars
i am using a vintage garrard turntable
a small device that doesnt color input sound and doesnt get in the way
purchased this and a comparable hosa cable
i use both electric and acoustic
this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality
i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back
thats not what it was designed to do
i use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesnt fall
this powers the system without hooking it into the usb system of your computer
but i like em both
the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend
so i ordered 6 more packs of these
with these strap loks the strap never comes off
did try to install software on a pc with vista no luck
it is difficult to use in a small apartment  too loud
sm58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high
this case solves that problem
i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick
a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up
forget the fab series they are not so hot
but if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the tone
tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years
well made tube with good amount of gain and highs
i have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable
i mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is
easy to use and very secure
i have several gls cables and have zero complaints
works well enough as a filter once you get it placed
and its always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions
survived a trip in a moving van from philly to boston
easy in and out with velcro retaining strap
ive never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars
well they werent very close anyway
the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface
not sure the new set is either but time will tell
this is a major plus for such a tiny inexpensive amp
the leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit
i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior
they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets
just a few words squier by fender
it is perfect to me
stop waiting and grab one you cant go wrong
this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board
feels great sounds great theres a little bit of magic in these strings
its great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar
polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric
great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking
maybe i can put a few potted plants on it
it provides great sustain and distortion
terrific bargain for the price
i got mine in a trade for practically nothing
keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break
they are warmer sounding well balanced
i tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars
i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name
this original plug fits the purpose perfectly
great for any zep fan
out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output
what do you expect for two dollars
theyre also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s
the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable
it is built extremely wellvery solid and sounds incredible
i didnt hear it when i mixed my hafler m1 speakers
this mic is quite good for its price
you dont have to be a rocket scientist to use it
i only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding
cfhevaluation unit provided by manufacturer
the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made
for under thirty clams i can look past these things
i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button
that was surprising since its a usb mic
i finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through amazon
i my world thats good stuff
like the retro tweed look and the sleeves that go under the ts jackets
all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning
to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone
the best thing is the price is great
still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed
its so dim i can barley see the reading when i squint
at its price point  5 stars
only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately
so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked
it shipped on time and the packing was good
its a flange pedal what else
the same goes for tilting
this pickup is actually a really great product for what it is
on a guitar strings are everything
its also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use
who knows but it looks way cool lol
the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic
oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard
about ten dollars a set which is really good
its a fender heavy so theres not much else to say about that
ordered these guitar picks for my son
but it sounds great when your recording songs
you can always remove more material but you cant put it back on
good cheap mic cover fits es57 ok could be a bit tighter i suppose
the metal housing screws into the jack
it sounds good and looks really nice
what these picks are good for is leads
i have these on my jazz bass my guitar player has another brand
they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great
other than that they look cool in the package
this will fatten up the sound of a dry amp
i also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly
frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb
it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection
unfortunately i think the roadrunner is better quality thicker material
i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations
the octave is a joke
what more can you ask for
one such as the screws packaged in actual twistnlock anchors
ive also heard of very very short battery life
i think ill tend to use this one a lot more than the other
i was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size
it may be the best string ever or not
a super cheap mono cable
ive always used shure or heil mics that cost over 250
the sound is not as crisp
what else could you want in a guitar strap
they are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice
its key to not get too much tension
cheap stuff a budget brand trying to pass as a name brand
i only have used this tuner on classical guitars the ones with nylon strings
im using it for my alesis q49 midi keyboard
not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze
i own one of each model
this does the job but its fairly thin and not all that well padded
its more like a preamp
occasionally i get a small pop when i engage it but not that frequently
thats on me this is a good product for what it does
who gets to play next
it is not too tight nor too loose
its very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits
better than i expect i going to order 2 more
its just the right length for sitting on the couch strumming daily
this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer
great price i own many of these
sure i can still use a regular pick when thats all thats available
i installed them last night and could not be happier
the mc401 is compacl but its heavilyconstructed so it stays put
a friend of my has one and i just found in love with it
i use it with reaper
im a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves
this pedal got it 100 right with tone after a tube switch
but when the humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements anyway
this is your best choice
this product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars
otherwise easy and a great product
i much prefer it without the winder
the screen is big and easily read
it loaded right up with no problem
think about what youre used to
i use it with my samson cl8 condenser and it is perfect
the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light
the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short
even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar
i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases
every color and size youll ever need
the only thing i didnt like about these
definitely a real good value for the money
really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot
best ive ever found so far in a tuner
played for another few hours and they sound fantastic
fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain
in my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass
having two tone controls makes all the difference
however i returned them because they are not locking
the delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound
nope but they sure do sound good
i was impressed by the quality of this product
the plastic is solid but not unbreakable
these mopads are pretty amazing
you get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness
good strap very comfortable and strong
didnt need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much
works as expected and should last a really really long time
tortex picks are the best
for this pedal they went with press on knobs
easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators
you will not be dissappointed at all
but very happy just wish had sometype of order
the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well
these picks have a good grip
this is not a toy  a great addition to your mouth harp collection
no more hiss no more static
when i plugged into the hot tubes i was surprised but immediately intrigued
the original speakers are too hifi sounding for me
ive been through my john pearse phase
i wanted a strat copy that i could customize  this is it
i put a pair of these on every guitar that i own
012s and this is one of my prize acoustics now
most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga
they work great on my acoustic and electric guitars
the unit does what it was meant to do
i play every day and gig one or two nights
when you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic
for the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life
for lead these sound dull
i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded
i wish this stuff had been around when i first started playing
nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls
my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning
so at least between these two i found no total differences
love the sealed bags to keep the air tight seal
i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues
you can get excellent instructions and tips on youtube
otherwise i use this cable at every show
would recommend picking up a new one when you order
b205d is a powerful speaker system
you cant beat the price for these quality guitar strings
worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased
ive tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated
has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesnt prevent dry out
they cost less money and i think the parts are interchangeable
this looper is serious worth every cent i spent on it
i decided to conatct the on stage people directly
the rubber feet are also smaller
theyre the cheesiest looking leather ive ever seen
its not always just the power supply making the noise
also i read a review bout it not fitting some guys lp
ill wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
reasonably comfortable but i dont want it cutting into my neck
all in all if you need a budget system at home  get this
cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent
these are fine but didnt fit well but they are a quality product
i got this for my line6 pocket pod
i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument
it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously
costs a little extra but well worth that price
clean the effect is a little weak
its so much better than my korg ca1
that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well
i like purple and it is purple
i prefer shars overture premieres which are the same price
when used correctly though it does its job just fine
i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects
this just sounds so much fuller and more real
this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment
warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one
i would purchase them again
not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
nice cord sturdy build good sound
wouldnt trust it again so i returned them
if you dont youll wish you did
price is right for entry level
this mike is a great way to start recording at home
the hue control gently affects the tone
i would recommend these they look great
i gig 12 times a month
the item shipped in time
i would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only
the big music stores always mark up the prices very high
when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me
totally perfect for holding my guitar
sturdy flexible and well designed
if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices
excellent product it is well cushioned
it did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall
after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference
i got too much background noise with the mike
still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool
the shipping was incredibly fast too as always with amazon
solid and steardy case that will last a very long time
the ukelele   the ukelele looks and feels decent
im using it with an lr baggs m1a active soundhole pickup
a good value box set of quality products
so all i can say is that it is working well for me
overall i like these picks a lot
i have ordered 6 or 7 or these
the j53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks
i really wanted to like these but theyre a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin mess
still in terms of grip they dont hold a candle to the max grips
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside
excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised
after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument
but for metal big strings i stick with ernie ball
it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable
i compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own
i have a marshall amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers
but mostly they are unplayable
excellent multieffect great sounds the distortions are really great
worth the money and is built well
does not scratch guitars finish just be careful and no issues
my old one lasted a long while and it still works
great stereo sound out of the keyboards
no sign of wear and tear
they do work and theyre effective but they are too pronounced
its not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable
i got 4 replacememts over 3 years
i love the tone and the reverb for 100 is amazing
right now i have the cr and one original speaker running in my tr
ive long been partial to daddario stringsi dont have a guitar without them
unlike many tube overdrive pedals this thing has tons of volume on tap
the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth
not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap itll do
you wont be performing with this guitar
i couldnt ask for more
it has exceeded my expectations
works fine and at the this price it cant be beat
sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks
no problem with any chemical reactions
the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric
then see how long you can own it
i dont get any hum and it powers what i need it to
outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time
if that time comes im sure this will be a great tube
i bought this because it was cheap and figured it cant be that bad
but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording soundonsound
had no issues in the 2 months
i like them i dont love them
the result was poor sound
this one looked sturdy enough
i still am an sm7b guy
cords are cords but these are very nice packaged great good deal instant turnaround
just as the others have said
this was a christmas gift from my husband
the tone control alters the basstreble mix but not very significantly in my opinion
sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa
i usually buy locally but the deal here was great
this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value
the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup
i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good
perfect size and does its job
ive knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged
i simply dont see any reason to switch atm
the fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price
its a great deal if youre willing to do a little work on it
update   i just saw that this capo is eligible for amazon prime
heavier than the m1 but it sure doesnt feel like it
but the sound is awesome
i can live with that
the to800 gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank
hosa cable gtr210 guitar instrument cable  10ft
mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue
the tuners are basic but they work well
bought these for home karaoke and they work great
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal
they were buttersmooth and great for flat picking
this little cable gets used on my practice amp
nice solid no frills guitar strap
this capo is inexpensive and works well
i use audacity to amplify when necessary to normalize always and to edit from
and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included
i use daddario strings a lot
the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position
also play the the concert scale banjolele
the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound
havent played the toy harps yet first things first
this is a perfect addition to any serious rig
i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead
this capo works just fine
i simply couldnt get this to work most of the time
ive been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding
these tuners including the red version are the best
so  online to see what defined state of the art
great sound over the original strings
but those are mostly minor gripes
and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security
the pedal is very good at this
the 10s are my choice for rock and blues
ive had one for about 10 years
be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order
not much to say about foam
ive been extremely impressed with all the different amp models
for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better
monster cables are well constructed
nice feel to it and seems sturdy
its simple easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound
use it every time i restring my guitar works really good
but for live playing its great
nice added peace of mind
add two monitors and youve got yourself a nice little pa
the thing is that they dont seem to stay
with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that
it is actually a good little practice amp
after piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner
i am pleased with the strap and the low price
could not be any happier
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice
first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression
and in general im pretty satisfied with it
i have the red  blinking light syndrome also
this is the best cleaning product ive ever used
oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar
its a beautful guitar and and im loving it
i buy elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now
i cant wait for us to do some mother and daughter electric guitar duets
be patient and get this one
i dont really notice a difference when i use different cables
i figured id give the drops a try
those strings made it hard to play so i tried these daddario mandolin strings
ive been happy with them so far
we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system
i frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously its a huge convenience
neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed
most people dont use chorus and flange at the same time anyway
if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note
is what it is and does what it says its does
this product is easy to use without any noise at all
i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life
this amp would sell for double the price tag
it is hard to describe the sound you woul dhave to hear it
a little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it
the tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place
which i have not tried
just thought i would point that out
not a drop in replacment for many fenders
so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed
i then tried one on my breedlove custom revival om with poor results
latchedunlatched mode  the best feature on the pedal
you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings
very useful when restringing a guitar
i feel like i should be paying more for these strings
i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard
major fail on their part
looks like it will last
glad i went with the jjs and not looking back
these are exactly what the doctored ordered
that plus the dryupclose characteristic are this mics top selling points
they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality
but i am going to keep using my dadario strings from now on
led indicators good and flash the speed
id play wirewrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings
using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal
these mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room
they fit on the athm50 headphones
saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car
looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks
im sorry martin but i like the elixers the best
for me i like the heft of these cables
i tried all different knob and eq settings as well
no issues  no problems only positive things to say about the oil
so i do carry and use these occasionally but they arent my everyday pick
ive used many strings and owned many guitars
it is thick and flexible at the same time
how does an amp just come down half price over night
just another example of the incompetence at fender
i am going to look for a decent one
i dont understand the clip for a tuner on this thing
it has worked great now for over a year at least
if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly
elixir is my favorite brand of strings
this is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should
the only complaint i have is that there is no onoff switch
your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings
really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it
i dont feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job
i was so wrong in giving it only 2 stars
for a regular guitar this would be fine but not bass
this rack is constructed better than i had really expected
goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface
i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus
some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge
this product seems to be a pretty good product
not much to screw up
this case however fits my dot custom like a glove
this is a nice little tuner
mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose
because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well
the way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem
go ahead and get them  youll be glad you did
my ears remain attentive to future string sounds
and the vox is 4w while the bugera boasts 5w
i would recommend it to anyone
just that there are better choices in my opinion
other than that i like it a lot
best tuners you can buy
this is a great product
ive used all the roland cubes that are battery powered
matte flat black finish is nice
i am a little disappointed
about as sturdy as a tripod can be
toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc
if you need a tube screamer
best price with free shipping
theyre cheap and they work fine
yes i bought 3 and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass
if you havent changed your saddle
their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order
so i tried this monster cable
the primary difficulty was in the how the users manual was written
ive never had one of these move from where i left it
also please check your intonation
be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly
but i bought this one and im glad a did
i really cant complain about anything
nothing to complain about here 5 stars all the way
it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight
delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed
i ordered spare batteries but havent needed to change one yet
and no digging the the parts bin for screws
time was when that was all there was
also my pitch harmonics better known as squealies come out clearer to me
it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well
this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use
the inside is nicely lined the hardware is solid
no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc
prompt shipping great price great product
with distortion it sounds great
i bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from hercules
using it as a foot pedal controller on my korg triton le
the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will
both the m1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my texmex pickups
its not some cheap plastic
i started searching around and found this product
for one thing your ears wont ring
you can just leave the plate off if you want
if i lost it i would definitely get another just like it
jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow
its cheap light simple and does its job
they also have a nice full sound and are holding up well
the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that visegrips work
awesome product to keep your axe looking great
very convincing and just 40
its fine for the price
this is a very transparent compressor
size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable
for these particular buttons i used a 18 drill bit for the pilot holes
i have a vox ac30hw2x and i put this jj 12ax7 into v1
it has higher quality and the dials feel solid
i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics
what if you need delay and modulation
and the top part isnt pink like the pic also as others have mentioned
although my overdrive sounds good
would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument
the interface is great and the clip works well
for a cheap 808 clone this is the best i have used hands down
this is not true bypass but neither is the boss
i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x2 champ
some other functional comments about it
i order 2 of these for my electric guitars
it handles these without noticeable signal loss
going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound
but i prefer the 114 sharps over these
they fit one of mine perfectly and another not very well
i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges
only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly
the c harp was terrible
purchased this to replace a behringer pedal because the behringer introduced a swishing sound
they have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better
the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring
must have been built on a friday afternoon or something
but this little baby is now my second favorite
just clear as a bell
no stress whatsoever indeed its just as quick and smooth as my boss
im sure ill buy more in the future
its so much warmer than the boss
i have used this on my les paul
i have several of these straps in different colors and ive never been disappointed
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board
use 34chromatic34 to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments
but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable
cant wait to get it and i will review it also
quick snap on and off
does all the job that i need it to perform
no sharp points to damage the guitar
always the best string i buy
a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps
i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better
im completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it
overall stays in place and does its job well
as you lower it the support spreads out wide
they work good for the sound on the strings
it was packed well and didnt have any damage on it
and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp
if i lose it im buying another
it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings
when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully
pay the extra money and get this set
it has a sticker that says made in china
i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin
the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use
rugged reliable and simple to understand
if you need to polish your guitar look no further
doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though
this snark will tune about anything
they work well with my cedar top guitar
its an excellent overdrive and an incredible value
i just miss the mecanical click of a mechanic metronome
it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge
dont panic strings marked adfb can be used just fine for gcea tuning
if youre thinking aout buying this guitar dont
i do not need anything fancybecause i am a simle person
so izm thanks hde for wasting my time
besides it wont look this good
easy to install also and for the money give them a go
this product meets all my expectations
one stand fits not all
terrific allinone musthave tool for guitarists
very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it
this is a heavy duty strap
i would buy this again
added mass easier to tune
so how do they sound
it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound
nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too
went to a local music store heard and was sold
one of the better trems ive had the pleasure to use
i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this
these strings are different and really quite nice
i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals
i believe it has those
i just ordered another skb fender case
small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction
you cant beat the price
ducks ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case
they sound nice and bright and they last a good while
at home or at a night gig its fine
seen many different capos but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser
works very well in this capacity
maybe it is built better
for the price i guess i shouldnt complain too much
it was nice to get these through vine and try them out
for now i would say buy one
i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices
intonation is spot on looks beautiful too
i just got this uke today
its easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops
sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars
the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile
a consideration  this is suede and will fuzz for the first little while
i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future
awesome engineering as jim dunlops mxr products has always presented
i consider that to be excellent customer service
bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings
i will be upgrading the caps
does it sound like an overdriven amp
i would definitely buy a few more of these
i mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do
horrible horrible drivers that never get fixed
i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for 6 strings
its better in every way than the ny reissue
so good that i bought another one
these danelectro pedals are great quality for the money
i would recommend this product
for high gain metal however i found that its a bit too hairy
great stand for the price
i messed with it for about 5 minutes
ive got them on my fender strat
nice quick release without having to tie anything
it really gets around and tunes them all
i dont know how eminence did it but i love it
and as for the winder
theres an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back
use its own mic you will be ok  with this for meetings etc
im sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me
that happens far less now
for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build
i use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary
and the price is right too
bought a takamine 40 years ago
i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though
this tuner works for sure but i dont think its the best out there
this set is no exception
its not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock
so first of all i want to say packaging is great
this really eliminated many subtle flaws i had with audio recording
it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices
im happy with this purchase
the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace
this is a handy little contraption
at 40 you cant go wrong with these pads for you studio
im quite happy with it
gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end
i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii
you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings
but id mic it anyway
cord works well and hasnt been any problem to date
ive done it  it sucked
lightweight slightly awkward but provides good back support
this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars
i have used monster cables for years and with good reason
this unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay
but then my fender doesnt have a pigs snout
sustain and harmonics are insane
any skilled guitarist knows  to use  extream  caution when tuning
on the mandy absolutely no problems
when it boils down to it i prefer my old planet waves tuner
thats exactly what i wanted from a desk stand
after couple of weeks i also noticed some volume variations as i played
i would buy more if i needed them
they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive
i could not be more pleased with this product
thats what the fender is for
these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock
what more could you want
i rub the entire neck down before and after i play
so if we can save a few bucks here and there it helps
in fact i dont think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours
it is simple to use though and it makes a lot of noise
id buy this product again if i had it to do over again
you cant beat this deal
the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music
this cloth doesnt slide around and thats a good thing
i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception 220 microphone
it does seem like it can break easily
great heavy picks amazingly cheap price
i had 4 mics 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set
it looks and performs like a studio filter
having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting
one of the internal amps will no longer power up
this case is the best ive ever had
i cant bend at all so no idea if its just me
they fit just not well
firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip
far and away my favorite amp model evah
soft touch easy care  cant beat it
thats why i got this
dont expect a 2 octave bottom because it doesnt do that
ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job
so whats the behringer xenyx 502 like in this use scenario
this works great with the mustang i amp
one of my favorite pedals of all time
this is a very good ts type pedal at a great price
so for a player like me these are a godsend
ive already returned the tuner
it is out there for 230 to 299
it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp
our son says its easy to use and has a good sound quality
the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished
i thought that more than 25 of the items cost was a bit much
the inside of the one i received was grey fur
good strings for the price nice ring to them
great pedal for a great price
has a 14in jack to easily plug into a guitar amp
others found this to be true too
it filled a hole that was missing
all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand
you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit
dava picks are one of lifes guilty little pleasures
if not this one at least buy some kind of cleanerpolish
i dont expect any problems
i wouldnt call them dull by any stretch of the imagination
and it also cuts the strings
this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies
that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances
this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used
i purchased these to use with my mandolin
the ds1 usually hurts my ears but with the cm2 behind it sweet
i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all
reviews described strap as 34soft34 and 34weathered34 which sounded good to me
the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb 11
good tuner unlucky with two lemons i guess
there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psusb
i guess it really revolves around your personal needs
i decided to go cheap and got the rp255
i got mine through musiciansfriend for around 2 shipped
however it does seem to respond noticeably faster
the locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat
concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger
i think i payed like 8 for it so whatever
such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hds
it is not overly strong or stable but the prices was right
its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like noncoated strings
the accuracy in my opinion just isnt there
the boss me70 is easy to use
the soundis full and fills the room
good deep tone for my acoustic guitars
i have used the exl115w set for years
theres not much to be said about this pedal  it just works
that wasnt really my goal
the lubricating feature is just a nice plus
also it cant be beat for when youre just jamming alone at home
stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time
might purchase another one eventually
overall i love this pedal at under 60 bucks
even works on a standup bass
i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars
has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way
plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup
and it arrived a day early
a genuine fender part that looks great on my 10 mim strat
i dont know why more people dont use these  theyre amazing
it is fully adjustable allowing for all body types
i will use it until i can find a better one
i replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar
think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier
i have purchased two sets of the mini locking rotomatics
it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear
for the price this is a steal
a cheap guitar at best
also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel
i ordered it and applied it
it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough
i bought primarily for travel and im pleased with my purchase
to all heavy music guitarist i highly recommend this one
i play blues jazz and bluesy rock
been using the snark tuners for while now
i see mixed reviews here
i have been playing guitar for longer than i care to admit
the 5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo
this is a distortion pedal
light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar
perfect for my line 6 75 wt
the overall quality seems good and i have had no problems
sound is about what you would expect
this filter is awesome and for the price cant get any better
i used this capo on a gibson j40 hummingbird and a j200
i guess i should read instructions more carefully
messed around a bit and it started to work
ive used several different kinds of strings over several years playing
second it fits great  does exactly what its supposed to do
it is a good pedal
if you want to play metal youre going to need a distortionoverdrive pedal
this has an output of 300 milliamps
this product does what it is designed to do very very well
it gets the job done
the wedgie is exactly what ive been looking for
its been a little over 2 years and ive used it ever since
i have to say that i am fairy impressed
so it wont sound the same on every guitar
its built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely
with live play this could hold its own and in the sweet spot
i have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars
i have no problem with it but the hola
bought this for my dot
then spend your savings on something else
every guitar player should keep this in their case
in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have
dont expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though
the guitar sings beautifully the tone is rich and vibrant
this does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment
for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable
they sound great and play easy
this strap is strong and sturdy
this is a great microphone
and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup
youd be dumb not to get one while theyre cheap
also with my win7 x64 machine
it works and i feel comfortable with it supporting my axe
works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand
good product at a great price
and silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board
looks great on the guitar and works really well
i cant say enough good about this amp
im pretty new to this so i take the blame
it tunes without any problems
i have other behringer gear and it always works
i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop
ive had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand
this unit is very sensitive
the construction of this set is superb
amazonhas placed it there as a public service
the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright
remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp
this is an extremely versatile pedal
the construction fabric color and padding are all a1
this is one of the cleanest sounding miniamps youll find
im using it as a spare so it should be ok
sounds just like an amp in your headphones
i bought this harmonica for our son
there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles
it is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship but not stellar
it has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great
what a great little stand
packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require
maybe buy and inspect with the knowledge you might have to return them
the velcro itself is insanely amazing
thats a good thing for the most part
but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings
i need to order a couple more packs though
this fits just right and looks just right
these are all your presets which many amps are doing these days
this bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price
ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change
i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast
otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger
sound on the other hand
i put these 150s on all of my strats regardless of the brand
reliable last a while and more important theyre inexpensive
works great for that and for uke
headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems
but for the budget i do receomend it
wish all pedals were built this way
i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal
i bought two more today
excellent guitar picks of medium hardness
the build quality is top notch
so they might work and they might not
nice picks much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks
i looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one
i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it
my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird
great price sturdily built great compressor effect
i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome
excellent tuner with one flaw
i put these on all of my guitars
my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this
its thin but does the job well
just to confirm several other reviews  these hangers are really nice
not only that i like the idea that its an us company
if you like warm sounds you should see something else
so i uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software
very good buy great packaging earlierthanexpected delivery  thanks amazon
pricey as far as strings go
i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally
the pencil condenser are questionable
however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar
if you hate droping your pick while playingget these
make your axe shine and look like a rockstar
i dont have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand
dr 40 was much quieter in noise level
heretofore ive been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism
needed a boost with my headphones while playing rocksmith
i will update in a few weeks as i see how long they last
it works well so far on all my ukuleles
bright and easy to read
of coursei could not recommend this product to anyone
5 feet 6 but actually are 10
what i use for wah is the digitech rp250 processor
i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric
these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound
i have an maudio black box which had a peculiar size plug
great mic for the price
this device is the best you can buy
the pedal has knobs for output volume and sensitivity basically amount of compression
if youre on the fence about this pickup go for it
they work great with my pedals
no onoff switch is a bummer but it works
just waiting for a good deal
we always have to go and retune it which can be frustrating
my only qualm is that its gator brand and gators remind me florida
beginnerintermediate level player would be very pleased
it fit perfect on my new hercules mic stand and was ready to go
i will say that its very easy to play
maybe its just me but thats how they come across
i got the same tuning results on all of them
both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal
cant speak to durability because havent had them long and havent used them heavily
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together
summary  just the factsa great pedal and my favorite univibe of all
like outlets 182113 outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9v and 12v
thats okay hes got competition and ill be purchasing from them instead
it is my sons first guitar and he is learning on it well
they are certainly worth having
it was a toy not an instrument
best part this strap gets long long long
this guitar sounds even better
i keep one at home and just ordered another one for school
assembled the stand in seconds
youll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum
at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months
it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo
overall a great little deal for the price
we mounted our two ukes on these
the behringer ultracoustic at108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job
i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest
this amp is small in size but full of sound
i use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar
they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with
the testers are very cheap and may show problems you werent aware of
i am pleased with the product
i think you will like this board
the legs make this thing very very wide
i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this
got the marshall dsl 40 watt combo
these cables are really the best
a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week
from extra slinky to heavy gauge jazz strings  you just cant go wrong
this is something i had not tried before
came with more parts than what were required
the design is really pragmatic and effective
i was a little disappointed
ive used these strings for quite a while now
as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound
i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar
amazon support referred me to the manufacturer
or at least not much
when i used that adapter it seemed to work just fine
you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows 7
no damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings
when i tried it at the shop it sounded great
would like to see stereo output options in future models
adjusting the height and tilt is difficult
shipping took far too long
plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol
combined with joyos california hendrix is almost in the house
i sent it back without hesitation
i have an older version of this model but it works great
use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape
there is also a model made specially for bass
ok reviewing somethings i just dont see the need
i would buy another if i needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument
this is my second set of these
mod switch adds a perfect 34chorus34 effect for 80s metal ballads sound
the fender logo makes it look legit
pivots in 1 direction only
i like the choice of colors too
lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies
i used that korg until getting the snark
i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin
we both been playing for about 3 months
small diameter gives it a shrill overtone
then you have the backpack handles as an option as well
i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did
they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there
bag was getting kind of heavy at that point
this picks are comfortable nice quality
one nitpicky point of criticism  the packaging is an issue for me
these things are heavy duty and thick
i took it out of the box and started to play
this pad is great for midi vstis drums queuing and its got great action
color wasnt as advertised its more of an offwhite than a vintage cream
besides what are they going to do
works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables
frankly id like to see a baritone version
this is stage one of my rebuild
it really will produce marshall plexi tones
well constructed durable built to last
rapidlyfirmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet
i did manage to get it on
then i stumbled on this cherub pickup
it is not something you are going to understand at first
its cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp
the cable also looks nice and completes the fender look
i can think of a million simple solutions to that but thats another story
you get what you pay for
lifetime warranty and you wont be replacing it any time soon
it transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true pa
and honestly for me thats what i need
and its got that new guitar smell
highly recommended for acoustic guitar players
a decent little 34sized traveler
a great add on to my student model for acoustic practising
isnt that what its all about
it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality
if you need a tube screamer
i would still prefer classic style
highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar
so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved
i cannot explain how cool this chair is
be sure to get a pop filter to go with it
though it will gouge your floor
yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows
no directions inside or on the box
wide sweeping flange effect great harmonics and little power useage
thats how much he payed
the colors and designs are pretty
great mount for the price
with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside
now there are two choices for excellent coated strings
i very nearly got a different amp
amazon comes through again on price and product
for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality
either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point
this little amp is amazing
its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists
the title says it all
i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together theyre fail safe
ive been playing for about 15 years and have always used a humidifier
i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings
my apologies to those pros out there who didnt need this clarification
furthermore they are very accurate as well
second this instrument is no lightweight either in heft or playability
my playing sucks  sounds better with these strings
the screws  anchors are poor
i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion
has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use
this is the one to get
all my guitars have piezo bridges
spot on tuning  very bright display and super fast and easy to use
no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind
i installed them on a korean made washburn wg587v
snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly
i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it
danny gatton did so and i wouldnt have it any other way
fuzz 1 is a creamy midrange filled sound
not a model of a champ amp the real deal
its a good quality great sounding tube
and i like the durability it seems like it will have
sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics
i like fender mediums because i use them on both bass and guitar
bought these and they worked great with my digitech delay reverb chorus and jaman
if you dont have one get one
i have no complaints about it at all
the orig still the best
elixir strings are great for me
i dont think you should drop it very often
if your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 469
and a note about the looks
i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles
twang to slayer in a flip of a preset
they last forever and dont rust
the chord works great no noticeable buzz
your option to change the wah configuration is amazing
they should have included something that doesnt fall apart
mediums do great but the thin fall right out
this was like 35 and sounds awesome
they last keep in tune and keep their tone
a bit small for my preference
solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge
a little careful sandingpolishing and the guitar was ready to play
fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything youll need
it assembles quickly and easily and folds up into a nice package for transport
has a headphone out with volume control plug and play
make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance
i removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit
i dont know a lot about guitars and strings
back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone
used them while building a few prewired pick guards
3 of which are actually output latency so this is really impressive
unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally
a must for any gigging guitarist
tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely its pretty sensitive
i would see how this goes and update the review
ive never found it to be excessive
the chromacast also has many more pockets
they were both amazed with the sound
to do so youll see a black knob at the base of the pedal
it fills out the sound and yet doesnt add any artificial high end
so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution
plays sounds feels and looks great
this is a great tremolo pedal
im very happy with the size of the sn1
these fit that requirement well
if it was a choice between the 2 the planet waves wins hands down
young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price
do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6 pop filter
the super slinkys sound great
this is a great guitar strap for the money
this is a perfect compliment to my current set up
i love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings
i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze
my first experience with levy and completely satisfied
even then you wont get a great clean tone
this is a great little tuner and i recommend it
ill probably have to breakdown and pay 100 for a real strap
didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing
i cant recommend this enough and the battery last a long time
built very sturdy with metal and not plastic
good build and doesnt look cheap
ive had no problem with this guitar stand
humidity  not a problem with this stuff
i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board
i was surprised at how heavy the base was
this pedal is absolutely remarkable
i could never get the levels right
and for the price you really cant beat it
this makes me very happy
i bought them for home use only
first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand
there are people who are comparing this to the shure sm57 and other microphones
uncoated strings last me about a month
this neat little tuner has it all
i see why you pay more
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated
well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent
its a great deal buy it
this pedal works great and doesnt slide at all
also compact and very durable
it uses stock os drivers that loaded right up
i like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily
again 8020s are recommended for mahogany guitars
really a remarkable microphone for around 100
im just a dude in a band
tuning with it can be condensed into one word  frustrating
they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect
excellent tone and im a bit surprised by that
you want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal
i ordered an 11hole pickguard and it fit like a glove
i believe i have been wishing for this for years
otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars
ive always liked the parametric eq on this pedal
this stand is sturdy and my guitars 34seat34 like an anchor
do you have a hercules guitar stand
this tuner did just fine with the low b on a 5 string bass
most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external powerpedals
can be done but not as good
like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined
this is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed
this was the easiest tuner i had
i put this on my mandolin
fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers
great device and good price
we have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive
my musician friends notice and wish they had one
this pedal gets me there on the cheap
so much so i may send it back
i mean these are cables
in my opinion it is worth the money
ive had several cases and this is one of the nicest
it is only one hole and very small
not for long seasons anyway
dont purchase this without buying a tuner
this product has turned out to be great with few exceptions
good quality and very good sound
solid no problems with the solder joints
i have 4 kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect
the seem to be all the same company
i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic
dont force anything and you should be fine
however i have yet to try it with my multitrack studio
its not fancy but it doesnt need to be
i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option
i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in
it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone
it has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come
here are my pros and cons pros1
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2
no more to be written joy o the american dream
king of the practical tuner world
this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard
not as solid as the
in this case i still got more than my moneys worth
those compliments apply equally to the cs3 compression sustainer
this is an amazing pedal
theyre not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones
as other reviewers have indicated a squier bullet
i chose this because i wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings
historically i have sworn by these though
i returned mine as it just didnt fit well for my uke or mandolin
the first thing i did was went through all the presets
no changing hardware like strap locks
get one youll be happy you did
a plastic bag does fine
it stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall
it was set up well and has played well out of the box
i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some
after stringing them up  tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded
please take a note of that
this is an amazing bargain
it may not be much to look at but it works really well
y con una buen duravilidad
i like this mic very much
what can you say about the best of the best
nevertheless for what it is
very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal
just remember that this model is for standard type axes strats teles and such
merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix
otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference and it should
for that its excellent especially considering its very low price
thats not pedal board friendly in my opinion
i honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all
the winder the cutter and the pinpull all work well enough
nice product i suggest it
i really appreciate the cutaway
the product is not meant to be used on maple
nothing fancy they just work
time will tell if they last longer than strings 13rd the price
have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have
distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards
the instructions describe 16 sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor
so dont buy it expecting overdrive
this is an all metal exc
truly an amazing little gadget
overall im quite pleased with the unit
that certainly explains the difference in price
this product works for me and the quality is pretty good
sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings
it makes restringing way easier its pretty stable and sturdy
if so youve got a bargain on some great cans
bending down picking them up then throwing
nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great
this sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which i installed the pickup
cant ask for much more than that
slips down becuase of wieght
both capos had this very same problem
these are for lead and not rhythm
i currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards
it was not dropped or abused in any way
for the price and quality this kyser capo works on a uke
im a beginner and is more than enough for now
ive turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy
definitely recommend these if youre sick of picks slipping out of your hands
hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines
but i really wanted 34natural wood34 and it isnt
i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall
leaves no ffingerprints or smudges
if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal
strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils
i like the recording software cubase that came with it
typical neck bores for tuners by brand are shown on the warmoth site at
i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style
i like their full sound and their lasting tones
so i have to give these three stars overall
its a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness
not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great
the strap itself is plain but it highlights the beauty of my guitar
the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package
its close enough for my needs
i have had several mxr pedals through the years
cheap easy durable these things are worth the small price
excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise
not worth the purchase in my opinion
so here it the continuum
however i believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine
this bundleincluding an 8pedal chain a few adapters and the power supplydoes it all
i wish i had 4 ears so i could buy another one
if you need a tuner this ones a good one
what a great little gizmo
very happy with this purchase
i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up
theres a reason all pros use metal
i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping
pretty sweet guitar for the price
the tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage
for 169 you cant expect to have the top of the line
i agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup
which you would expect with all the other stuff it comes with
this is a very sturdy and wellmade bag
its durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
i like the ej 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar
what more can i say
i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning
you could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra
lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal
but it doesnt work right so its like running with a flat tire
small compact functional and it works
forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand
i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself
they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate
i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school
they are both great pedals that i use all the time
genius idea that i wish i thought of first
it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat
except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs
it also is a nice smooth od not too crunchy
i installed these on a silvertone sd10 which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar
they perform quietly and give a more mellow tone
when i need another set ill buy these
for the price i have no complaints at all
for those wondering about latency obviously theres some
i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar
not i have piles and piles of picks going unused
its like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on
my guitarbanjos tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass
once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer
so all is not lost there
im a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only
update 2011jul31  the strap is still rather stiff
still hoping for that harley though
i got these for my electric and the ej2610p acoustic electric for my acoustic
you wont be disappointed on this buy
the attack is second to none
excellent rack screws with washers
when i did this it completely shut out the hiss
como solo boss lo sabe hacer
can take some fiddling to overcome it
just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out
daddario exp16s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used
for the price this is totally worth it
but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing
i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly
the ditto is so easy
good for rockabilly and 50s slap echo
guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic
i absolutely love using these strings 1046 on my telecaster and stratocaster
i would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well
the snark sn8 is far superior
get the batteries it did not came with any
works great and love the colorful display
ive got to be missing something here
look up mxr phase 90 mods and eriks corner will show you how
instantly i was in love
i also wouldnt recommend it for anyone just starting out
everyone who sees it loves it
as far as the vintage tones go
it also helped with the rather high action
purchased this for my son who plays both acoustic and electric guitars
thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster
daddarios are the best and i love the ball end color coding
this is the best one out there bar none
it would not seat properly and would slide out
these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything
i tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail
i purchased this key on a whim
you can get a tutorial to do anything on youtube
it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup
it surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all
as the title says these are a great value and work well
true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo
yes this pedal is made of high strength plastic
small piece of adhesive tape on the back
good for the price and no regrets
the repeats are long and do not sound artificial
i used this and the color became rich and less dry
i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake
excellent bag for tripods or stands that dont need a lot of protection
one of the cheapest prices on amazon
these arent an expensive tuner comparatively speaking and thats good
i love this guitar string winder
ive used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count
ill update this review ifwhen it breaks
wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger
it let me know that i am not a techy
the windings brokeon the dstring at two places where the string fretted
but if it happens there will be an update to this
these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully
one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp
i will definitely be buying more
i can see this strap lasting a long time
ive used these for years
great match for your bedroom amp
recommmended if you dont mind a molded cable
i was worried that the plastic clips wouldnt hold up but they do
my wife uses on her 6string acoustic and electric guitars
so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics
they are the leader in new technology of strings
another factor is the strain reliefs at each end
as long as the guitar is on it works great
ok theyre a little odd but for the price i dealt with it
very small changes can have large effects
the next thing to do is to block the tremolo whammy mechanism
if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again
stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully
easy to see when positioned correctly
was ready to go out of the box
although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs
overall a very good product
yeah go look that up
they either work or do not
great guitar strings and affordable
the 300  350 are cheap and they work
my original review very easy to install didnt require drilling
now its right where i can find it everytime
unbeatable for acoustic especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy
i really like epiphone products
im very happy with this little mixer
the notes are slightly difficult to bend but the reeds are still loosening up
bag was ripped so i almost lost the screw and washer
ive had fun with it
great cable for patching in and rocking out
the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precisionmachined
34 anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price
really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality
rest assured electroharmonix is good stuff and the price is right
like any other tool it doesnt always fit or please everybody
tried rebooting a few more times still didnt work
this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range
it is what it is and not much more
i sprayed on all my guitars
however i could have got this product for a lot cheaper
much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage
the tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost
this pedal also sounds great with gain
the design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud
hangs my guitar around my neck so i dont have to hold it there
they hold the strap on just fine
i highly recommend this upgrade
this takes the guess work out of tuning your hides
well worth the extra investment
yea how could a music stand be amazing
and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use
sixth the price is amazing
hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables
both knobs at 12 oclock toggle in middle didnt change the internal switches
so potentially i could have 40 plus pedals in a chain
looks like made of good materials
midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine
this wah petal is so much fun
these are shred picks they are very accurate
i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking
capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary
application method is also very useful
i looked to make sure it wasnt warped or cracked and it wasnt
at least they wouldnt be able to put together a quality banjo
the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent
it has impressed me quite a bit since then
pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release
really just stupid powerful for 300
its a mainstay on my pedal board now
not so with the spider iv
it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would
for the working musician or home recording man this is great
overall it is a bargain for the price
it matches my awesome at2035 microphone
i did purchase the protection plan for 10 so im covered for 2 years
but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds
really nice upgrade for your standard tuners
i can really hear the difference between new and old strings
it sounds great and it has loads of power
its fit very good to rack holes
dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible
forget about all the presets
however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several
search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg
i love the unique selflocking mechanism that it has
the distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy
i havent had a problem with this
i still use both brands
hey jerks do you play guitar
the cable came in the time it was promised
decent holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles
they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison
you now have a quick release strap holder
id not buy another of these for a ukulele
they also last a long time before they go dead
phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful
the string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns
i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it
other things worth mentioning its not as heavy as my vox all tube amp
i love these pick holders
i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2
this is a great practice tool
dislikes   quality of chinese products is a crap shoot
it cuts my signal a bit
that said i lovebehringer products that i own
i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one
one user even claimed epiphone should sue him
its a small amp but its bigger than i thought it would be
90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast
for 15 you cant beat this
produce is great price and good quality
i tried ernie ball slinkys just for shiggles
a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows
other than that a wonderful system
they are also very durable for foam screens
i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer 6pedal board
slap and tap an dont forget ur strap
id suggest buying them by the gross
to me these always feel perfect
stays in tune very well
5 stars all the way
this is a well made table top stand
its still in my primary set up
this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings
first of all 20 ft is not too long
the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new
buy the focusrite interface or one of the others
but its not a 5star cable
price very reasonable price for what they do
it is a concert size which i like
and the ukulele looks so much better now
it comes with a mic stand holder thing
on my el cheapo violin these strings sound quite nice
unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable
it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point
that was years ago and i couldnt get rid of it fast enough
the case is awesome too
i wanted to test for myself
probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately
the strings stayed in tune
this is a really nice strap
the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain
for fit  i have a large noggin like size 7 58 hat
this is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling
so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin
no more winding string wraps around the tuning post
46 starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality
they are basic standard traditional strings
a real needed item is you play in darker rooms
i am starting out learning to play guitar
look forward to getting those crappy loose unsmooth original hardware tuners off this thing
its easy to put on and take off and it does its job
i use the picks occasionally
the joyo allows you to make this change easily
itll do the job but i dont like it
they look great and work well
distortion is more noticeable at higher volume
but it was what i was looking for
id rather just pretend that florida didnt exist
not so much for a guy
now it sits in my drawer and collects dust
as another reviewer put it this wont replace your daw
doesnt cut into your body at any point
feels solid and stays in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions
if your dog loves toys keep this out of reach
it works with ableton live 9 with no problems
just changed strings on my epi les paul and this windercutter performed flawlessly
there are better guitars out there but not for 170
for the price this pedal is a good deal though
good because itll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles
it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints
good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment
this just doesnt work for me in the studio
i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice
but this is going to change all that
the quality doesnt suck so dont worry about
tons of sounds and it can be 100 edited to fit your demands
very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound
if it doesnt take batteries thats fine but give me an adapter
also has no affect on sound of bass drum
it lasts long sounds great and feels very nice
its very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap ive ever had
flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action
of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably wont care
you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam
this pedal received the gain and jcm mod
good solid connections with no play
and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality
just to keep picks in my guitar case
use at your own risk
eq is to enhance your tone not create it
if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get
this guitar tuner is such a great and useful tool
the same sound for a lot less money
and when you are ready to wail just turn up your guitar volume
1100 i rate this a 98 gear head satisfaction
a must have for the yamaha pa130
this string is not muddy sounding like many flat wounds
if you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand guaranteed
just buy it and move on
i would recommend going a little higher price
would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling
yes there many banjos and some with more frills
weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down
they are great you will love it
when i saw these things a light came on in my head
great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while
my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use
seemingly no tone loss no added noise and no coloration
i tested this and yes it does go louder for whatever the reason
edit  92212i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow
however the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws
if would 100 recommend this pedal to anyone
my acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments
this product works as advertised but you should beware
in my opinion this thing is well worth the price
all it does is make loops
the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo
also it quit working suddenly after about a year
the only one ive found that doesnt is the kyser
i mix and master all my own music on these guys
it was quieter with a much better midrange
im a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldnt have this problem
not the smoothest operation in the world but its gigbag small and accurate
then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm
recording from the internal mics seems to work fine
flawless comes to mind here
i dont know about a 7 or 8 string though
we just need to be open to it
im loving this pop filter
still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone
the good news is you do not need to buy converters for them
just not my cup of tone thats all
im not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself
it is far superior to previous tuners ive used
tuning is quick and simple
i like blues style and classic rock
it also seems to be very accurate
this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice
you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed
the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy
i use it for podcasting purposes
i will definitly look into their other products
well i have to say that it did well
the small size means it fits my panniers just fine
with the xtra heavy picks i was losing what little treble these strings had
gotta love these strings that just wanna sing
highly recommended for confort and durability
folds up if needed for travel
the 63 spring is great the plate is also really good
but it is not very good at parties
es el output original de fender
let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect
also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models
will buy it again in the future
it can be a little daunting for a newbie
b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal
for the price this is an amazing pedal
i also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a celestion g12h30
it is ok definitely not great
it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and wellmade
i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didnt work
we all have our preferences but im not an ernie ball fan
sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars
i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back
what more can i say
you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase
my inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound
snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down
easy to mount rack components
buy this guitar u wont be sorry you did
they have no coating  so they squeak like hell
no big deal as it wipes right off
i cant believe these were actually sent to me
using george ls makes it look even better
just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
ive used stands for over 27 years and this is the best ive owned
these cables are solidly made affordable and really easy to differentiate on a mixer
i use the  exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads
although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars
light construction but  you get what you pay for
i normally buy daddario strings here
i have even sold the picks at garage sales 25 cents each
they also work well with acoustical guitar
but i was getting pissed because the ernies kept corroding so quickly
i had used some boss ce5 and ch1 and substituted them with this unit
they work well on bass and acoustic however
this is the best pricevalue purchase ive made in a long time
its a fun strum and well worth the 20
works very well with no problems
i would pay twice that for what this pedal does
awesome unit for the price very happy with it
i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp
the output is also a little less sensitive than the d5
ordered this and two cables
this product may actually be the ls10 killer
been using these for years
great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar
to top it all off the price is right
but for practicing in your bedroom or similar its perfect
there is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it
i fried a bbe delay the same way
any size wuhan china sounds great
it can put out up to 1700ma
great product with nice feel and tone
i tried it on bass and was really impressed
i need to resolder the ends after a concert though
take some time but it was well worth it
i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them
you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want
the name is pronounced phonetically as follows  dadairyo
not worth lowering to 4 stars though
little did i realize how good this one really is
pretty basic strap but durable and works for me
great for picking kind of harsh for strumming  quality seems topnotch
the quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear
im more blues orientated now and love it at the end
id say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals
the power jack however leaves a little to be desired
so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey
cant complain about a price like this
holds my guitars just fine
i read the reviews of the few similar options
this little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate
decent strings i used for a beat up strat that i had
but then i needed a reverb pedal
adjusts easily nice width comfy enough for me
i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick
tue quality is very nice solid and resistible
this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles
i dont think this can be beat
its also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing
not so with this pedal
what else could you ask for
other reviewers commented on accuracy
needless to say its not going anywhere
i sound like a rock star with it
i didnt notice any change in tone
it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out
noise gate used to be always available
i just glued it to my pelvis
these are my favorite guitar strings
dont enjoy them as much on acoustic
i worry the battery will fall out very easily
i lost one and had to buy another one
we messed with the pa and all the electronics
i never thought that it would be so solid
others complained about this and they were right
but overall i like it
makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one
for the price it should be and is great
good feature for the price
to my ear it sounds good but you never know
technically this at108 is at the low end of the famous behringer line
the user dials in the frequency sweep they want
im only nitpicking so that you will know all the tradeoffs
a good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control
just a little larger than a zippo lighter
luckily id also picked up a package of these ernie ball strings
simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors
this is a very good investment
all in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point
it is pretty and very strong
mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat
our thanks to daddario for their assistance in satisfying this customer
these are great strings worth the money and sound great
there were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price
update  january 7 2013
not remos fault but it is something to pay attention to
we tried to make the shallers work but just could not
if its 30 wait a few days and see if it goes down
great build quality works like it should
what a great price and product
folks this thing is built like a tank
they dont come much better
for live performance this thing would be perfect
thought id try this but theres another brand that i prefer
if its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds
nope it isnt leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff
i had zero noise level using these cords
im more than 20 years of playing guitar
all the finish is excellent
i bought three more after trying the first one
it does very well with single coils
i have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well
this was a low price and high quality solution
at least the previous 2 i bought did
they look good as well and they are easily adjustable
i have a lot of pedals
this is the one hands down worth a minimum of 150
feels little tiny but excellent gain
they fit perfectly and are of high quality finish
no way this thing cost lest than 40
my typical strings are elixirs so im used to them lasting a long time
the cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings
noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price
they dont touch the floor
at 2000 this bag is a steal
i adore the sound of this unit
still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing
each adjusted to and held its guitar securely
be sure to check is the length of the arm is ok
should come in different sizes
cant hold tightly on 1st string low c a little buzz
uncolored 20db of clean gain
for me thia is the best cables ever
i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge
now aesthetically this uke isnt as pleasing as say a martin sorpano
in all honesty buy a nicer filter or none at all
i prefer an extra heavy pick because theres no delay from pick deflection
this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds
very handy for making it all just right
just a bag for my guitar stand
this is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me
and then to go out to test some more
do not buy this piece of junk
it is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it
absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and smallevent purposes
this stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well
the ac adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness
its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound
id definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon
legs hold up pretty well also
this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected
the one thats more universal
each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand
check your guitars sound hole diameter before ordering
that being said my go to strings are still daddario
i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar
all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable
i liked these a lot
5 stars for this one
they are also priced very good
but if you follow the darker side keep looking
this is an absolute musthave item for any gigging drummer
all guitar stores display their guitars with them
this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for
the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it
this is a tough unit easy to set and locks tight
i still prefer these 100 over other strings though
and the truss rod adjustment is perfect
fits the behringer xm8500 perfectly
i bought it for a silvertone sd10 which costs about 120
combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner
this little mixer gets both of those jobs done right
for practice or in your house these are probably the way to go
i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights
they shipped in less time than expected
its quite a bit stronger of a microphone also
overall a very good product
they do the job well
if you cant afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul
this cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session
i am also looking at the zoom h1 which will come out in sept
what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere
small 34thumbs up34 to amazon
this cable is very well constructed
works seemless and great with a headset
if i bought eight adapters it would cost me well over 120 usd
definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier
its so light i dont notice its there
but is a good product
a very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many
i did not know that these cables actually made a difference
the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for
it folds up so small and yet remains very stable in use
your attitude and hands create the sound in the end
great feel doesnt slip in sweaty fingers
this is a pretty cool item
i have lots of tuners and several brands of clip ons
thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob
they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful
ill definitely buy more and highly recommend them
these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners
i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros
some people think its the power supply but nobody knows for sure
adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar
to be super critical here is another tip
im completely satisfied with this
another item never received but i would not use anything over
i like it4 star rating according to amazon
the spring is very robust
so i agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid
i am very pleased with the product
these are much more flexible so they last forever
very good rosin and does exactly what is described
heres my take  for what its worth
i bought this pedal for the compression and sustain though and am very pleased
my kids are all interested in learning the uke
great stand holds my mid sized keyboard up very well
this is a great little amp especially for the money
you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it
at shows i rely on a tu2 stompbox for tuning
however i like to play at a substantially high volume for recording
cannot beat the value for price
i suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version
the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic
you get what you pay for
50  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i dont use
it did work for awhile
because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable
well worth the small cost
i have countless delay pedals and racks
this 4oz bottle will go a long way
i just put it on my baby taylor guitar strap
i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings
what would i recommend you purchase
i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market
excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass
however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone
now i will be checking all of them for sure
heck yes it sounds that good
id recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure its secure
im going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it
great price great tuner worth the buy
for the price i got a little more than expected
yes one side in my test sounded better i felt
particularly with a clean signal aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells
but this definitely has that problem
i have also found that the ernie balls break easily as well
my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap
nice microphone stand for the cost
this one serves the bill
fantastic pedal especially considering the price
just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings
now that i have it i take the quality for granted
like many here the case could be an inch bigger
prosportability easy of use and set up
youll either love it or hate it
they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup
my son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford
the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds
it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments
i really like this tuner
i would recommend something thicker for that though
it was cheap and came fast
its really not a 200w system
amazon always comes throughwithout a hitchit was delivered as usual before stated time
i have to say i really couldnt feel the difference
i have been buying these stands for years and will continue to do so
sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a
its a great musicians party favor
im pleased with the digitaltoanalog conversion
some people may not like that
the lo contour knob doesnt increase the amount of bass produced by the amp
runs a little bit on the hot side
great find well worth the purchase price
its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musicians
found a sweet spot near area 34234 on the weak instructions
firm fit solidly molded ends reputable branded cable
arrived quite quickly but a tracking number wouldve been nice
the quality is great price is right and delivered on time
that is the function of an eq nothing more
the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir
nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions
and respond great at any dynamic level
i know is plastic but
fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing
i really dislike the switch on this thing
side by side the mxr won hands down
sound is like its real big brother
they are just faster and easier
after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning
quality good especially given fairly low price
and of course the guitar sounds good
i have tried several different brandstypes of tuners in my 13 years of playing
no big deal at all
s display to be more than sufficient
he was not incredibly pleased with it
you must use the headphone jack on the interface
i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics
it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening
i havent used it much on my electrics
it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea
just what i have expected
i could find nothing better on the market for the price and features
get it if youre on a budget
it is accurate  very reasonably priced
or just buy a better guitar to begin with
nearly all do but some companies like blue snowball snowflake etc
beyond great tone  playability these suckers are reliable as all getout
or play along to develop my chops
thanks guys for the great little product
i bought the snark sn6 uku tuner
there are some annoying things about this amp
its the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly
playing went from painful to pure pleasure
this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level
a musthave for your guitarbassukulele bag
im going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good
its a short boom but it works great
the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box
update  too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also
this was my first strap
i think it almost doubled in price a week after i ordered
nice and thick the adhesive is very strong
a quality tuner for a low price
because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary
also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash
my more recent snarks are still running on original batteries
it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well
within 5 minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect
a must have for us dry californians
the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops
the best part is the price
strong spring that good start
decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar
they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse
all in all a good deal
it has both gain and volume output controls and both work
the arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into
these work like a light switch
it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar
they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase
doesnt suck tone cables are sturdy and they sound great
i have to admit my own vocals arent perfect
its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing
its awkward to apply and remove quickly
its a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done
high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound
so i plugged it in and didnt really care for it
you know it is a pretty decent stompbox
it is well made and i would buy it again if needed
good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts
the perfect accessory for the stage or studio
i mainly use it in 4 channel mode
its very simple and is perfect for me
it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe
this beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my martin
its a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment
their tone is slightly bright but not as 34harpsichord34 as the exp
the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing
ive had this cable for awhile and im not too impressed with the quality
both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same
if you are looking for a small plug and play amp
ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago
locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open
sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way
nifty little item that does what its designed to do
i would buy this again
reasonable price makes it even better
not really that good for  music
i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar
the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same
with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood
these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others
did i mention it has a blue light
these new ehx pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass
having color coded cables are also good too
you should check out the 78 badasss distortion from mxr too
it works the same and is pretty durable
these light strings go from
i have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners
the materials feel high quality
great product for the price
just a basic female xlr to 14 inch male adapter
as clean as a marsh possum
i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions
the sound and tone are great and the price is right
one this is a long island company located in farmingdale new york
have used daddario strings since the late 70s
highly recommend anything by d addario
small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc
this one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some ive tried
it is small and unobtrusive but easy to read
goes one easy and feels sturdy
they are comfortable to use
the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly
very simple very userfriendlyand the feature that is most important i think versatile
aquila strings will never let you down
i have one for each guitar and just leave them on
excellent price and product is as described and price was right
if you havent used these picks get some
everyone has their own preference and i just didnt like the feel of those
i believe ive rated this instrument before
it is tough sounds like fire and will serve you well
theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands
works perfectly with iphone and ipad
there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar
my title says it all
bought this for my son
then again i never did really like tss
it is perfect in controlled stationary environments like home studios
ive owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk
i always used another companys strings and avoided ernie ball strings
update   played for a couple hours
xlr is a better quality than other connections
i will buy these again
still other strings have a rich full resonance that carries through a room
he especially likes the colors
i use them for everything from full band to acoustic
when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly
the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately
they are beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play
if you have a minimixer you can do the same thing with that
but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldnt recommend this item
i recommend tightening the housing because everyone of mine were loose
does what it says it will do and it does it very well
got gold to remind me it is for six strings
this pedal is simple durable affordable 40  45 and it just works
youve got to get this pedal
it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints
their sound is bright just like their xl cousins
finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless
for 50 you literally cant go wrong
the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected
fits fine on my cheap rogue a type mandolin
i am now thinking about trying this on my martin
kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip
it does what its supposed to do what else can i say
not much else to say
looks better than the expansive one my grandson has
this thing is incredibly cool
if youre on the fence
im using it with a fender eightyfive solid state amp
great little piece of leather
from there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as
pros  they look very nice
what you see is what you get
i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy
looks like planet waves hit the mark once more
this will increase the life of your strings
2 consistently use and replace batteries
i wish my car dash looked like this thing
and the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it
tones bands specific songs sounds
you lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning
they dont vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they dont need as much clearance
ive not broken one yet and the 1148 is a good gauge
i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case
i just got it today
cab is made of super cheap particle board
im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder
neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply
guessing they are lacking some shielding
this bag is made well enough
yeah i know  never heard of it
i ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised
the stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport
ive ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags
i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist
you have to actually play one to understand what im talking about
amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem
but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs
if you are stop doing it
but the quality of these cables can vary greatly
got a new tenor uke and couldnt resist putting my fav strings on it
no i am not affiliated with the company at all
next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay
they arent that expensive especially as an addon and theyre relly cool
garbage if you like it
this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course
this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to
they have a long life and do brighten your tone
it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparseacousticclean backgrounds
connection is secure no worries about uneven connections it also detaches without a hitch
my guitar just love it
oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it
it works great on both
im really happy with this and would replace it god forbid
thank you and say goodnight gracie
these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools
after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks
its metal and it works
save your money unless your under 10 years old
its almost odish in its responsiveness
and what to do if one does fail
this capo does exactly what it should
that said youll probably do ok
i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag
does what you want and need and looks great
not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day
it doesnt sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it
i bought 2 of the same ziotek extension cableat the recommendation of focusrite
bit too thick for me
they give some versatility in their length
i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great
gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist
these arent usually my goto strings but daddarios are a good solid sounding string
the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change
glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig
after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug
so  build quality excellent
works like it is suppose to good quality
so whats up with the 12 volt adapter spec behringer
about the effects on finish
for 25 bucks i dont think you can beat it
still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price
its very hard with room temp 70f
if comfort is not important to you then get this strap
i used a rubber washer i had and that worked very well
i highly recommend this guitar
the effect is really great
i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine
will do the job until you find the one of your dreams
tascam should consider a similar accessory
these work great and look sweet too
i can just quick release it when im done
i have a yamaha f335 i really like
there is no close second
got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin
good cheap strings for guitar
its heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo
i think i could write a book here
exactly what i was looking for
both of those elements are present on this signature amplug
this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps
as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand
long wait for overpriced item
the distance between the plugs is sometimes too short
youd be better off with a couple of books and a towel
this is a nicer set
these drops are not just a convenience
much more grainy and tiny but that may be a plus for you
i also have a small peavy 50 watt solid state combo
there are better options out there for something portable
this little stand collapses and sets up so easy
it helps to clean the guitar
my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using
easy to put together and holds my guitar very well
what a difference with the epiphone
put up against these i fail to distinguish the difference in sound
took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron which recognized it immediately
like the option of nc or no
i would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many
frankly im not a fan of most onboard effects with combo amplifiers
the sound quality is amazing
good mixers especially for multitrack recording can be complex and difficult to learn
maybe but imo these are the best sounding strings ive played with
the only reason this is not a 5star review is because of the drings
i would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet
ive had this for nearly a year and i have no complaints
finally and this is important theyre incredibly comfortable
who says you cant afford the good stuff these days
this is what all distortion pedals are judged by
it holds up very well also
same made in china product with another no name logo stuck to it
it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well
i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it
the lines for the strings and frets are very close together
i used it live and they are really great durable and it feels pro
reaper had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel asio
buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer
update on reviewjan 9 2013
im used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck
this is definitely more accurate than a persons ear while other instruments are playing
inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune
but for average boards they work great
its durable and works perfectly
quality has always been very consistent
it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring
ive used ernie ball fender prs just all kinds
sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords
not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise
the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 775 x 65 approx
one note  this does not come with any picks
pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did
maybe all the people at tascam have really big heads
this ampwas a wonderful deal at 300 when i originally bought it in 2011
battery life isnt super but satisfactory
this mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instruments
i decided to try the guardian and save a few bucks
i know cause i playem geetar real goodlike
but i only use my favorite strap
all in all a very nice bargain
but my mexistrat is now complete
a workaround for the main issue follows the review
quality and price im just satisfied
the colours help with organization
hell of a bargain at less than five bucks
very nice quality and very cool color to them
the classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp
ill just keep using my pockets
they also have pretty colors
i may need new cables
this little dude does a great job
these stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced
even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over
goodsounding and playing allaround strings
so check with what you get
groove tubes were the tubes to have in the late 80s
there is no noise or hum
behringer us600 ultra harmonistshifter pedal is pretty good
the metal fingerpicks are rock solid sturdygauge steel
im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back
definitely the best amp in this
i like to walk around while i play
these flex steels are excellent
also run the us600 after the distortion for optimum performance
the difference between this one and clamp on style is night and day
i bought this to sell mainly but now
i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too
both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head
it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add
the sound is very forward i would say harsh
if turning your head at all is a dealbreaker get the snark
for the money i dont think it can be beat
every other modes are just nothing special really
no more slipping out of tune
it has just become a needless expense
its obviously simple to use having one knob and all
the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable
i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars
instead of hammering it out i used two screwdrivers to pry it out
ill just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesnt have one
great simple pedal clean sound
finally found the right one
it functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun
the mistake i made was buying them hastily
they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat
my only minor gripe is that it is springloaded to open
high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best
also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables
it was wellconstructed with all the connecting points working precisely and securely
it has plent of volume which is good for boosting
i have 3 world tour bags to keep my axes safe
i have a wide variety of vic sticks that i bought here on amazon
the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects
with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking
it is not road worthy however in our opinion
great replacement and a definite upgrade
how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable
having these nyxls on there is just one more added benefit
not only that but im actually getting to be notthatbad at playing either
screws just the right size
still there is no reason to fear trying these elixirs out
a lot of overdrivedistortions filters modulations delays reverbs all carefully modeled
will get aother one for 2nd guitar
this is an original gibson gear replacement part
not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine
lucky this is a good option
this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro
i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it
mxr is by far better then boss imho and i do love my dd3
but these seemed to work well on the guitar i was restringing
it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it
it seems like it is good quality
if looking for that oriental sound this is it
so far i am very happy with these strings
the straps on this fender stay put  love it
im not hot about their acoustic but electric
a little stiff but im hoping it will loosen up with use
thanks behringer this is a great value
the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small
its quiet and has a very active tone control
it also beats the other boss delay pedals available for quality sound and features
i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this
this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely
very heavy cord and top quality construction
i prefer the more precise and wider scale 1 readout of the snark
i would buy these again
i like another brand more because they feel a little more solid
and despite its very low price its very solidly built
what more do you want
i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price
the star of the joyo lineup however is arguably the jf02 ultimate drive
tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results
daddario is awesome if you keep in mind that theyre on the cheaper side
great strings and the best packaging
it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus
price was a big issue
better yet refund my money for the product i paid  minus shipping
they snap and go airborn which is dangerous
sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price
nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough
you need monitors or quality headphones
try them out and make your own decision
i bought it mainly to use with my nonpedal steel guitar
and you cant dial it out
i remember these from 35 years ago in high school band
came in a timely manner what else is there to say
both have excellent sound quality
these have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others
micing for larger venues would work just fine
i bought 4 and going back for more
the sound from a 40 pedal is outstanding much better than i ever expected
this should do well for you
clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio
its all about money to them
i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software
youll never get your arm in there far enough
we all have our likes and dislikes
it fits well where i put it
so i am not a newbie to playing or working on guitars
also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more
hey i got this and an ovation idea from godps
it it anchored to my board
i like them but i love the schaller locks more
i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price
they last longer than most other brands ive used
this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar
one of the best stands in the industry
it is also just great to 34hang34 on the headstock went not in use
well packaged for shipping arrived 1 day early fair quality
the title says it all
also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps
ive had them for 23 months now and they havent failed me yet
a lot of songs say capo preferred
im running windows 7 64bit and everything installed flawlessly
they break down faster than id like
i was able to record a whole song in no time
but if you sleep on the left youre gonna have a bad time
behringers mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price
since the mic has a built in interface you cant use any other
it does however clip into the sound hole okay
theyre also quite good on les paul style guitars if you like slinky strings
ill get another cr if this one holds up okay
it restored the soundpower and clearity of my amps
this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musicians gear stand
they tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders
versatile and great to work with
tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound
wow i will never buy another sm57 again
shipping was faster than advertised
its simple  easy to use
but you dont have to take my word for it
i would recommend purchasing it
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks
this review is my honest opinion
so the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker
this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genzbenz bass amplification company
i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome
oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound
maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise
granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors
smells nice and makes your guitar looking new
it has a retro look and an old school sound perfect
basically its a preamp that sits on the floor
one could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals
the only reason i need to buy more  i lose them
it sounded like i was in a great concert hall
much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up
bought it to replace strings for my taylor
if you need 34light34 maybe keep looking
i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs
tried them on a gibson j50 and they seem to do good
34hey can we get blue turned down a little
we got this one for my wifes mandolin
this is the first strap that ive bought in a long time
this cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use
i got them fast and saved twenty bucks
easy to adjust with a bit of practice
i was a fender or daddario guy and eb ss were beneath me
daddarios are top quality and very reasonably priced
probably insist on  34dont mention anybody but us
inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge
i havent heard a hint of feedback and the onoff switch is a plus
i might try out the 28strand next year
overall i found the available tones to be excellent
the threads are smaller on these
if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo
ive been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the 1980s
with the jam i have this
they are inexpensive and sound great
i think i already mentioned something about it being sturdy
you have to get this pedal
i thought it would be resin or plastic
i suspect that most folks will want less of this than more
i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me
overall i like it and its certainly worth the minimal price
like them and never an issue
just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use
although i only play for fun i still play 23 hours a day
i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again
it does not fix your transmission
i cant really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings
i bought these to go from my board to the amp
i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individuals needs
it works as it should
phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine
this light is exactly what i needed
i havent banged it around but have had no problems with durability
they look as though they come from the same factory
you really cant go wrong for the price
sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off ca40 does not
when you need a nononsense leather strap that is not long consider this
it does its job pretty good but it does color your tone some what
they are all battery hogs
it has much better tone than i expected and very good action
its a nice little amp good for carrying around
i bought these for my little sister and she loves them
i have been in need of a tuner for far too long
works well on mandolins too
it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away
ive mounted my samson q1u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it
turning it on though the display is quite different
its solid well made and looksfeels like it can handle the world tour
great extra light polyweb strings for guitar
i use mine  daily and it hasnt failed me yet
a great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric
yes its casing is plastic but quite sturdy
its low profile and is easy to switch by foot
it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do
you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think
it simply does its job and does it very well
it does know when your guitar is in tune
this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price
i liked the big boss tu1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations
i have two ibanez and two essex basses
i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price
the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal
now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out
where i really noticed the difference was in recording
means only that dr 40
grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year
when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer
the tension is a little tighter than id like but works for me
its got a better build quality than the snark for sure
i cant recommend these enough
this is the stand you remember from the band room
he would definitely purchase this product again
while some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele
it cost me 2090 with shipping
this one is probably closer to a 150 guitar
i used it to connect my behringer bcr2000 in midi mode naturally
i did compairation with somes i have its perfect vocal
i dont have any problem with this stand at all
enter the fender frontman 212r
the competitors that ive tried do not
that said this pedals has some wonderful uses
except for that 22nd fret oh well
i cant speak for someone with a bit smaller of a headand ears
34you know your man is working hard
received these with lightining speed
modulation and delays rocks they sound good
the neck strap and the base are excellent
i have been using these strings for a while now
it cannot be denied that the boss dd7 is a versatile effective product
i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy
in this case the strings sound good
guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on
the tones are rich and warm
soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue  muffled audio recording
the customer liked them so much he kept them on
but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you
thered is also an ab switch that is almost a tone mode
tuning then became a breeze
excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player
works exceedingly well for any use
of worlds crappiest pot metal
the unit itself has held up well
i love the product and all the features for the price
mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body inside
it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already
to me the hot plexi sounds more real closer than this
my washburn d30s will never leave home without one
this thing controls your tone so well
i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it
the tone is bright and snappy
i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo
38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these
low cost strap lock that works on most guitars buttons
i could never get the sound i wanted using other manufacturers strings
considering these strings cost much more than others i certainly am disappointed in them
its a very fair price and is made well
this is a nice pick holder especially for the price
however the price was great and the sound is good
what i expecteda more dead sound than the noncoated strings they replaced
great sounding sturdy enough build etc
it only works with a power adapter no battery
you can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings
i should have gotten the 15 foot but you live and learn
i have to of them
there are scores of chromatic tuners on the market
up to this point i havent been very impressed by solidstate technology
i cant speak to the string life
i suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside
they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too
i think tascam would be wellserved taking that into account
you pluck your open string hard  tune as described above
first and foremost this amp is amazing
i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips
i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording
very affordable and good quality
it hums crackles and i think im having problems with my equipment
you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings
this delay is really nice especially for the price
my only real gripe isnt unique to this model but to all snarks
i have small hands and had no problem playing it
first the tuner issues that ive been reading about
and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound
so versatile light weight and well constructed
it sounded ok and i like the features on it
the screen pops out easily but it will pop back in
so its basically like adding another channel to my amp
ive picked up a few of these for my various guitars
have you heard good 70s recordings
ah the folly of youth
and they sent a case
duh i should have thought about this it makes perfect sense in retrospect
its simple and very secure
builtin string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus
i own both the h1 and h4n and i love them both
i will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases
i want to get more guitarjust to get a other one
the cases you get now could be made by a different company
as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy
great output jack i love this one much more because is more durable
the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels
but anyways bottom line great unit for 2000 and sounds good very versatile
very much worth the cost and i thank amazon for having them
it definitely worked a lot easier than the untreated microfiber cloth
smooth reliable action and no noise too
i had trouble with strings going out of tune too often
i use it the most of all my pedals because its pretty much perfect
dont let the cheap price fool ya
overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be
as an acoustic guitar player i think this is a great product
its for studio not live performances
the texture almost looks fake though
i did not want to spend a lot to start
great little stands at a great price
i share most of the same sentiments
its light portable and fairly sturdy
but 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for me
other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle
the promise is a 34bolder high end fuller low end34
i have that one too
once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand
guitarists have become a bunch of corksniffers
once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now
this one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be
i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet
well you get what you pay for  leather looking paper wouldnt hold guitar
details the basic concept is good
this is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three
i mean cmon what can you expect for that price
you have just simply got to try this little guitar stand
now whatever number im on is the reference number for that drum
other than that im not quite sure what makes it specifically a 34ukulele tuner34
that said i have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well
also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aesthetic
i got this pedal cause is not so expensive and i love music
i zero the spring verb and use the pedals onboard reverb for best results
i finally got the best out of that set of strings
so this was a birthday gift to myself
this left me to the old plug and chug method
not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon
but its still fun to use
as the title says it works
i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago
i put the hybrids on the new les paul
not to bulky and the right angle plugs save space
i compared this to a vox valve modeling amp not even a contest
very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles
ive already posted about fast fret
that last one was far far better than the first two
sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion
this little guy does all it needs to do
tremolo varies the volume of the sound
oh by the way i have an s6 for sale
this will be my beater mandolin at 25 nothing can beat it
find the same slide in large and i wrote a complimentary review there
strings are half the battle with stringed instruments
i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one
it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it
but what is the point if it is so much inferior
this posilok miniboom is a nice clean look and is very functional
the effects are hit and miss as well
nice bends and of course the longer playing life
it works great thank you nady and amazon
i will be buying one for every guitar case i own
i just feed the shoulder strap through the carryhandle and it works well enough
i put a heil fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax
again it works perfectly for my situations
the two together make a nice portable recordingproduction combination
these plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for
ive purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months
from the front you can barely notice it at all
ps  i dont review products that dont stand out as excellent
this unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh
just clip it on about the nut and tune away
i loadedthe effect into a slot
i didnt realise how much noise my one spot was adding
you could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed
sounds decent and stays in tune
i actually own an even dozen of these
it coils nicely and has good connectors
and it works darn well in a quiet environment too
with all the other great reviews noted here i decided to buy this guitar
this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments
they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely
i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them
high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes
a second problem with the mxr custom comp is noise
i just dont know what kind of liquid to use
people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix
im normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever
for under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain
some nice picking with this pick
however behringer makes a distinction between the c1 and the c1u
heres my takepros  cheap
you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time
there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups
he mentioned the need for one so got it
the pedal generates  a lot of 34noise34 so i cant use it
everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs
great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap
however that tuner had at least two limitations
you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased
drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly
i sent it back probably due to my ignorance
they will require that i drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly
but the positions it allows make sense for 99 of players
i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 8899
he says they last a lot longer and sound better too
im glad i replaced it
the storage compartment is nice and large
order it now while the price is this low
the gateshop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review
my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s6 and i really like it
100 picks for 20 dolares
it does pick up percussive noise which you dont get with under saddle pickups
this string winder is adequate but not really solid
made of metal it should last a lifetime
im starting to lean towards the tortex
blame the moron who knocked over your guitar
after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured
all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for
for 22 bucks cant really go wrong
but its just not a good product
if you use strings you should buy them your damn self
i read the description but it did not say cheap
a fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from
i wish id bought it long ago
i never cared much for the sound
only issue they break easily
i bought it during the black friday sale
and just switched the mics out
the effects sound excellent to me
what else do you want it to do
their are two issues with these straplocks that i have come across
i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar
its warm and the modulation sounds great
the similarlypriced fender is a fpos
it seems to hold tight
i currently have a looper overdrive distortion echo and tuner on my unit
easy to install i used the guitars existing strap button screws
this is a great product
also it may be a litle larger than some like
i have had it for three months now and it is still fine
this is the best amp in this category
these picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction
i dont forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough
cant really beat it for the price
i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite
do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with
it feels heavy duty and stays still during use
this is a great value for a practice and travel instrument
it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything
try daddario instead love their tuners
it was incredibly easy to install
found the guardian at amazon and thought for 10 how could i go wrong
for 7995 this is a must buy
you pay twice as much in a store
for the more casual player these might not be the best choice
this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones
i bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp
zt should not have sold this for 450 in the first place
the input and output connectors are excellent
fenders at least americanmade ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes
i really cant recommend this highly enough
simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain
i have found the perfect strings and these are not them
i had to have one
mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping
so this is some good stuff
phosphor bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars imho
and im planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program
zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much
i am disappointed in this thing
i promise you wont be sorry mcons  no power supply or usb cable
i have these on all my guitars and always will
you can never have too many guitars
these are not shure sm58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs
this is a great strap for the money
get a 10 foot and be free
i use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great
my only complaint is the markings on the level knobs
and manipulate the external controls as needed
i wouldnt say its agreat instrument but way more than i expected for 60
you get 2 in package with screws so i have a spare
it also lubes your strings
my thumbs dont have a particularly excessive diameter either
strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job
my songleaders have tested it and guess what
its usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues
this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps
i also have a boss gt100 multieffects unit
so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable
nice for collectable or to use
it has a ball joint construction
i lost one already so now i have 9
this boss pedal just didnt work that well for me
uses a 9v battery or 9v adaptor
i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather
i couldnt be happier with these items especially the ovation idea
holds my bass guitars easily as well
look no further these are great bags
ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you
042 on the low e which is just too small for good twangy bass
second i dont like having a lot of pedals
i would order these again
this capo was just perfect for my needs
you can get these in 24 packs at
today same thing and its obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp
it is my first pedal of any sort
it looks and feels great on my luna butterfly
ive read that folks prefer the kk over the madeforthegsminitaylorpickup
it is of course difficult to tune when others are playing around you
i like the sound they provide and the price is nice
i keep mine in a protective case when i am not using it
it helped me create a separate fuzzdistortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile
see my other reviews on these pedals
the rogue analog delay is wellconstructed and feels very high quality given the price
six out of five stars
ive been using these picks for 10 years theyve always been great
its also a good choice for women
this is mainly a matter of personal preference
this is an excellent alternative to using it as a usb device
thats what i always say
it was a pleasant surprise
i just recently started up learning guitar
these cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else monster cable
easy to assemble and feels very solid
i play it every day
im quite happy with any of the on stage brand stuff i have
i dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like
for distortion look at other boss pedals
i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably
its portable and runs on 4aa batteries
hangers adjust to required width of head stock
over the past couple of months ive been replacing guitar straps
it really saves on batteries and extension chords
this will make your fretboard smile
my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led
looks great on any guitar
tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just ok to me
i bought this strap for my luna 12 string
just try and leave it on always
this one is definitely a hit
seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound
no hiss hum breath noises or distortion
comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it
whats also amazing is that its still around a 150
in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat
i knew i did right by buying the dr212
only problem is the strings
very good stand especially for the price
fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind
this thing can do anything
nice bag with great features
or just disappear from use
these do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage
ive got hours if i chose to
this pedal wont be leaving my board probably ever
its considerably heaver than than i thought
however i had problems at first until i made some changes
does not get me excited
ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it
my only complaint with this device is the battery connector
it was easy to install
use it all the time
pedals are not budget friendly
this is a cheaper alternative to the 34string swing34 wall mount considerably less expensive
the edge is now smooth and nice
these strings are what i needed and they perform
i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky
the pedal cuts through and is articulate
something you might want to think about before getting one of these
i use these pins on some of my 34 size guitars
small price for big help
this cable is mono only ie not for stereo recording
that being said this has been the best interface ive ever owned
these are the best sounding in my book
if you want a cheap childs gimictype toy this is for you
louder than my friends 60w
i wish theyd just name the settings 34clean34 34overdrive34 34distortion34 and so on
this does the trick just fine
if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap
the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker
it fits the mic well
ill still recommend this wedgie
ends are made of leather
i got this for my grandsons squier by fender 34 size acoustic
just today i got the new tascam us100 usb audio interface
some users report quality issues here  i guess time will tell on that
i am very pleased with this purchase
no issues to speak of
for a soft bag this offers all i would ever need
if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired
im glad i finally decided to get it
easy to set mic slides in or out up or down
the color in the pictures doesnt do it justice
microphone works well for acoustic guitars
otherwise it gets a big hard to read
these are good but different
these are not only the best in delivering tone but theyre durable
i like the playability of the
i have not had them very long but seem to do well
it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package
this is a great product for a beginer
if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldnt be a problem
very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff
and my tele sounds as great as it always did
i am still using these everyday
the action is of course too high
this pedal is really small in size has one knob  the footswitch
i like the 334 wide for my bass
i put these on and what a difference
and youre gonna do that right
but do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon
these are not going to unwind on you or break easily
what is this amp exactly
they are easy on the fingers
hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings
i liked my first one so much that i am putting in another order
one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button
hey it gets the job done and thats all i can ask for
the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl 2010 multipattern studio mic
the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings
light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped
the snark is cheaper too
they figure a guitar that cheap cant be much good
a quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them
this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great
